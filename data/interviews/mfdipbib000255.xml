                <p>Interviewed by: Charles Stuart Kennedy</p>

                <p>Q: Today is the 17th of March, St. Patrick's Day, 1997. This is an interview with
                    William J. Cunningham. I am Charles Stuart Kennedy. We are doing this on behalf
                    of the Association for Diplomatic Studies and Training. To begin with, can you
                    tell me when and where you were born?</p>
                <p>CUNNINGHAM: I was born in Santa Monica, California on January 21,1926.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you tell me a bit about your parents, about
                        theibackground?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNNINGHAM: My mother's side of the family is of German heritage. My great
                    grandfather and great grandmother migrated from Germany to Iowa in the 1850s.
                    I'm doing a little bit of family research on them and in fact I found their
                    golden wedding anniversary photograph. My grandfather's name was George and he
                    moved to California from Minneapolis in 1912 for reasons of health, his and some
                    of the other family members. My mother, who had been born in Minneapolis in
                    1899, spent the rest of her life in California. She was educated at a private
                    high school, Ramona Convent, operated by the Sisters of the Holy Name in
                    Alhambra, California.</p>
                <p>My father's side of the family is of Irish background. My great grandparents on
                    that side also immigrated in the middle of the 19th century to Massachusetts. My
                    grandfather Cunningham was trained as a boot maker. As a young man he went to
                    California toward the end of the 19th century. He at first applied his trade
                    knowledge as a boot maker in San Francisco, which was the big city in California
                    in those days. Later he settled in Los Angeles and became a very successful
                    mortician, or undertaker as they were called then. He had ten children, one of
                    whom died young. My father was the second oldest. He was a medical doctor. He
                    was probably the most highly educated member of that generation in his family.
                    He completed his medical degree at St. Louis University in 1922 and began his
                    practice in Los Angeles.</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>He had known my mother since high school days. They were introduced by his
                    sister, my aunt, Kathleen. They were married in June of 1924 and lived in Santa
                    Monica until 1927. According to my mother, my father's practice was not
                    prospering there because there was a lot of competition. My grandfather owned
                    land in the Antelope Valley, which is on the high deserts of California about 80
                    miles to the northwest of Los Angeles. My mother encouraged my father to go out
                    there and she persuaded my grandfather to develop the land and have my father
                    manage it for alfalfa production, so that is what happened. In 1927 they moved
                    out there and began cultivating about 40 acres of alfalfa seven miles east of
                    Lancaster, California. I was a year-and-a-half when we moved out there. I don't
                    remember Santa Monica at all. My earliest memories are of the ranch, as we
                    called it, in the Antelope Valley.</p>
                <p>My father resumed his medical practice there and he became very successful. He
                    was a general practitioner, a typical country doctor, who made house calls as
                    far as 40 miles away delivering children in the middle of the night; taking care
                    of youngsters who came down with mumps, measles, chickenpox, and all the rest;
                    taking care of hunters who got themselves wounded while hunting jackrabbits in
                    the valley on the weekends; taking care of people who were injured on farm
                    machinery; all those sorts of things that you do in that kind of community.</p>
                <p>That's where I grew up. I have a younger brother who happens now to live in
                    Houston, Texas. He was for thirty years the performing arts critic of the now
                    defunct Houston Post. He now is a program annotator and writes for several arts
                    publications. It so happens that he has a review of the latest Houston Grand
                    Opera productio“Jackie O.” in this morning's Washington Post. I also have a
                    sister who is the middle one of the three of us. She lives also in Lancaster.
                    There was a fourth child, a sister, between my sister and me. There was
                    something defective and she died within a few days, hours, after birth in 1927
                    or 1928. My father died in 1961. My mother is still living. She is 97 and now in
                    a convalescent hospital in California.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you go to school?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNNINGHAM: I did my first two years at St. John's Military Academy, a military
                    boarding school in Los Angeles, California, operated by the Sisters of Mercy. My
                    parents were both from a strong Catholic family and they wanted all their
                    children to have a Catholic education. Unfortunately the depression came along,
                    and I had series illnesses in the second grade, so it was not possible to
                    continue my education at a private school that must have been costly for my
                    parents, then with a young family and married only eight years. I went back to
                    Antelope Valley and continued my education at Roosevelt Elementary School, now
                    called East Side Elementary, through the eighth grade. From there I went to the
                    Antelope Valley Joint Union High School, as it was known in those days, in
                    Lancaster. It is now Antelope Valley High School. It was called Joint Union
                    because the school district covered parts of two counties, northern Los Angeles
                    County and southern Kern County. I completed my high school education in January
                    of 1944 and immediately went into the Navy V-12.</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course World War II was in full swing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNNINGHAM: That's right and the D-Day landing had not occurred yet. American
                    troops in the Pacific were still way down in the South Pacific. Guadalcanal had
                    taken place a couple of years earlier. I'm not sure if they had gotten to Tarawa
                    by '44 or not. Anyway, it looked like the long haul still at that point and I
                    went into the Navy V-12 program. My mother had noticed the announcement of the
                    V-12 program the previous year and had encouraged me to take the entrance
                    examination, which I took in the fall of 1943 at our high school. I was selected
                    and went in for a physical exam at the Navy Recruiting Station in Los Angeles on
                    December of 1943. I was sworn into the Navy there on the 8th of December
                    1943.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The V-12 program being what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNNINGHAM: The V-12 program was the accelerated wartime naval officer-training
                    program. It operated at maybe 100 colleges and universities around the country.
                    It lasted four academic semesters and they were all accelerated. You took three
                    semesters of course work in a calendar year, and at the end of the fourth
                    semester you were sent to what was called deck school at one of a dozen
                    locations in the U.S., mostly major universities like Columbia or Cal/Berkeley.
                    After 18 weeks of training at a deck school you were commissioned an ensign in
                    the U.S. navy, and sent to sea. There were 120,000 who went into that program. I
                    believe 46,000 were commissioned as Marine second lieutenants or as U.S. naval
                    reserve ensigns.</p>
                <p>I was assigned to a V-12 unit at Washburn Municipal University in Topeka, Kansas.
                    During my second semester at Washburn I learned of an examination for the U.S.
                    Navy's ROTC program, which was also operated at colleges and universities around
                    the country, but at fewer of them. At that time I was told there were only 13
                    Navy ROTC units. I have since seen figures indicating that the number was
                    larger, perhaps 30 or so. In any case, I passed that examination and was then
                    transferred to the U.S. Navy ROTC unit at the University of New Mexico in
                    Albuquerque. I went there in October of 1944 and did five semesters there. I was
                    attracted to that program for two reasons. First of all there was more course
                    work, more college work in it, seven semesters, until commissioning. Second, the
                    pay was a little better. As an apprentice seaman in the Navy V-12 program we
                    were paid $21 a month out of which we paid laundry, insurance premiums, and
                    bought savings bonds.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And hair cuts, too.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>CUNNINGHAM: That's right, and other necessities. The midshipmen's pay (nicer
                    uniform also) was $50 a month so that was a big raise. Also upon commissioning
                    in the navy ROTC program you immediately went to sea. When you finished your
                    course work you went to sea, and that was attractive to me. I was there and was
                    commissioned in June of 1946. By that time the war was over. It was at the
                    University of New Mexico that my interest in the Foreign Service first was
                    stimulated. In any case in June of '46 we were given the option to take our
                    commissions and go into active reserve, but not on duty, or to take a year of
                    sea duty and then go into the active reserves. I elected to go to sea because I
                    felt first of all that I owed the country some service for theeducation that I
                    had received at taxpayer's expense, and secondly I wanted to apply what I had
                    been studying.</p>
                <p>The Foreign Service story really begins in New Mexico. I think it was the first
                    semester that I was at New Mexico during the winter of 1944-45 that I took a
                    course in international relations, or something like that. The NROTC program was
                    very highly structured, as was the V-12 program. It allowed only a few
                    electives. Out of 132 credits I think we were allowed something like 40 for
                    elective courses and I put a lot of that into Spanish, and then the rest into
                    what were called Government and Public Administration. A man named Victor Kleven
                    who had attended Oxford taught this course in international relations. He was
                    not a Rhodes scholar but he allowed us to think that he was a Rhodes scholar
                    until asked directly about it. He had been at Oxford the year after Anthony Eden
                    went through there, and he was in the same class year as Lord Carrington, I
                    believe.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A former foreign minister, I think.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNNINGHAM: Yes, and I think permanent representative at the UN.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think so. I'm not even sure that he was a foreign
                        minister.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNNINGHAM: Yes. He was very prominent in foreign affairs. In any case, Kleven
                    was on a first name basis with Carrington. Kleven was the ultimate Oxonian. He
                    never came to class in anything other than a three-piece suit. He always carried
                    his handkerchief tucked into his right hand sleeve. He wore a Homburg around
                    campus. He had a very Continental air. He was a very nice man. I took a number
                    of courses under him.</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>In this initial course in international relations that I took with him he gave a
                    lecture on diplomacy one day. I remember going up to him after class and saying,
                    “Professor, that was a very interesting lecture. How does one get into that kind
                    of work?” By then D-Day had taken place but the war was still going on and any
                    career in diplomacy was obviously going to be a long time afterwards. I don't
                    remember for sure what Kleven told me but whatever it was it somehow led to the
                    notion that I should go to the Georgetown School of Foreign Service. That may
                    have been what he said, but I don't know now for sure. I kept the conversation
                    in mind and began to set my cap for Georgetown at some time in the future.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tell me about your duty in the active Navy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNNINGHAM: I was assigned in July of 1946 to the USS Incessant, AM-248, a steel
                    hulled seagoing minesweeper. It was built on what was called a PCE hull, or
                    patrol craft or escort. I reported to the ship at Terminal Island, California in
                    July of 1946.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was in San Francisco?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNNINGHAM: No, it was in Long Beach Harbor adjacent to the Port of Long Beach. I
                    reported to the ship and I was told that we were to take the ship to Shanghai
                    and turn her over to the Chinese navy under the assistance program the U.S. had
                    with the Nationalist Government of China at that time. The civil war between the
                    Nationalists and the Communists was in suspense at that time. General Marshall
                    was in the midst of his ultimately futile effort to mediate the conflict between
                    them and to persuade them to form a coalition government. This ship had been
                    captained on most of its previous voyages by a man who was described to me as an
                    eccentric individual and who was no longer the commanding officer at the time I
                    reported aboard. Just before relinquishing command of the Incessant he ordered
                    the shipyard to remove all of the sweep gear, and all of the armament from this
                    ship. When I boarded this ship it was essentially a nice yacht. It had no
                    functional purpose whatsoever. We couldn't lay mines. We couldn't sweep mines.
                    We couldn't shoot at anybody except with a couple of Garand rifles and side arms
                    that we had on board.</p>
                <p>Anyhow, I went on board this ship and we were to set sail a couple of weeks later
                    for Hawaii with a crew of four officers and one third the number of ratings that
                    was authorized for that kind of vessel. We had one quartermaster, one
                    storekeeper, one engineer, etc., etc., all down the line. Off we went with a
                    flotilla of three other vessels, the same class, the same type, except they were
                    equipped for minesweeping. It took us two weeks to get to Pearl Harbor. We went
                    through a terrible storm outside of the port of San Pedro in the California
                    channel there. I was never so sick in my life. I had to stand watch and I was
                    absolutely delirious. Somehow after a couple of days things calmed down, and I
                    did too, and the rest of the trip went off all right.</p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>I don't think people nowadays realize what bad shape the U.S. armed forces were
                    in at that time. The shortage of qualified personnel in all ratings on our ship
                    was just one example. An Essex class aircraft carrier was berthed just opposite
                    the Incessant in Terminal Island. That carrier had a rust spot that went from
                    water line to the top of the conning tower and spread over nearly the entire
                    side of the ship. It was less than a year after Japan's surrender and the end of
                    hostilities, but our ships could barely get underway and the U.S. did not have a
                    single combat-ready division. The speed of demobilization had a disastrous
                    effect on our combat readiness.</p>
                <p>It took the Incessant two weeks to get to Hawaii. I think I was the first guy on
                    the ship to sight land on that cruise. We went into Pearl Harbor and we were
                    told that we were to sail for Shanghai in three days. I was the supply officer
                    and before the last mooring line was made fast to the wharf I hit the dock
                    running to find a warehouse from which to restock the ship. We were there a
                    month, as it turned out, and at the end of that time we were told that we were
                    not going to Shanghai though the other ship three ships in the group were. We
                    were being sent to Bremerton, Washington to decommission the ship.</p>
                <p>We left for Bremerton I guess some time in August or September in the company of
                    two other ships. On the way up there one of the other ships - - the Pirate - -
                    lost main power completely. They had a complete engine breakdown. We were three
                    or four days out of Bremerton at that point on the high seas. Since the
                    Incessant had a clear after deck, thanks to the removal in Terminal Island of
                    all sweep gear and armaments, we were designated to take the Pirate under tow on
                    the high seas. Thank God it was a calm day. We had to get a thousand foot steel
                    hawser across to the Pirate, which we did, although our crew of mainly first and
                    second class seamen had no training for this sort of operation or experience
                    with it. We started the operation about noon and just before sundown everything
                    was secured. We made our way safely into Bremerton where we did decommission the
                    ship in November of 1946. It took them a month or so to decommission the
                    ship.</p>
                <p>Finally toward the end of November, about Thanksgiving, I got orders to report to
                    Tiburon, California to the Harbor Defense School where I went to learn how to
                    manufacture anti-torpedo and anti-submarine nets and how to put them down. That
                    training period lasted about three months. Again, there was a long hiatus from
                    the end of the training period until onward assignment. It was very boring
                    hanging around the BOQ and the officers club there. It was not far from San
                    Francisco but we were not able to see it and it took a long time to get in there
                    by bus, the only means of transportation available to us.</p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>I was finally assigned to the USS Cohoes, AN-78, a seagoing net tender. Two
                    officers only were assigned to these ships, so I was the Executive Officer,
                    barely 21 years of age. The skipper of the Cohoes, whose name I don't recall,
                    was Lieutenant, and old salt who had come up through the enlisted ranks. He was
                    a very colorful man, full of stories about at least one trip he had made to
                    Antarctica on a expedition aboard a wooden hulled ship called the Bear. When I
                    reported aboard the Cohoes was sent to sea, though not to put down anti-torpedo
                    nets or anything of that nature. One of our jobs was to remove mooring buoys at
                    various harbors and coves along the California coast where landing craft had
                    been moored during amphibious training exercises conducted during the war. We
                    would tow a barge down and spend a day hauling these things out of the sea. They
                    all smelled to high heaven and we would put them on the barge and try to locate
                    it so it was downwind of the ship.</p>
                <p>The other thing we did was to go up to Drakes Bay, which is north of San
                    Francisco. Liberty ships were being brought back to the U.S. from the Pacific at
                    that time in tandem, one ship towing another that had no main power. Our job was
                    to disconnect the tow from the towing ship. The ships without main power
                    couldn't be towed into San Francisco Bay because of this 1000 foot steel cable
                    used for towing would drag along the bottom of the Bay and cut all the cables
                    connecting San Francisco to other communities around the Bay, so these tow had
                    to go up to Drakes Bay (so named because this is where Sir Frances Drake landed
                    in about 1579 during his round the world voyage) and be separated there. Nobody
                    on the other side of the Pacific thought about this problem or how these ships
                    were going to be detached from one another. We were ordered to go alongside of
                    the tow, up under its bow, grab the steel hawser, good United States Government
                    property, secure it to our ship, and cut this one inch high grade steel cable
                    with an acetylene torch in order, thus releasing the tow, which then would be
                    steered by tugs into San Francisco Bay. The hawser, minus the portion we cut
                    off, would somehow or another be retrieved by the towing ship. This procedure
                    violated one of the cardinal lessons in my seamanship courses: never willfully
                    destroy a standard issue steel cable, which usually are manufactured with
                    connectors at each end so that they can be shackled to a pad eye on ship or
                    shore. Indeed, we were taught to do all possible to protect these cables from
                    wear and corrosion.</p>
                <p>We made several of those expeditions to Drakes Bay. In one of theI think the
                    second - the tugboat pilot who was steering the tow got us lined up wrong with
                    respect to the sea and wind. The Cohoes and took a roll against the bow of the
                    ship, and half of the bridge on our ship was demolished. No one was injured, but
                    we kept slamming against the side of the Liberty ship and taking more damage. I
                    was on the deck with the crew, which was working feverishly to release the lines
                    that moored us to the Liberty. My language on that occasion included vocabulary
                    inappropriate to my subsequent diplomatic career.</p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>We took the Cohoes back to San Francisco Naval Shipyard, got her repaired, went
                    back to Tiburon, our home port, and made a few more expeditions. I learned to
                    maneuver the ship pretty well and was proud of that. I did a four point landing
                    one afternoon bringing it in alongside the dock. I wasn't able to duplicate that
                    the next time. I was released from active duty in June of 1946.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNNINGHAM: By then I had been admitted to Georgetown School oForeign
                    Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had you received a regular degree already or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNNINGHAM: No. That was the problem with the navy ROTC program. I had 132
                    credits when I left the University of New Mexico, but I did not have a
                    bachelor's degree. The curriculum for the deck officer program, in which I was
                    enrolled, was so designed that requirements for a Bachelor's degree could not be
                    met through any combination of elective with required courses. If I had majored
                    in one of the three engineering programs (mechanical, electrical, or civil) I
                    would have been able to meet the requirements for a B.S. degree at the end of
                    seven semesters, but I didn't want to be an engineer; it didn't interest me. I
                    was in the general program, the arts and sciences program you might say. The
                    required curriculum was heavy on engineering, science, and math. I had four
                    semesters of mathematics through to higher calculus, and of course naval science
                    subjects, so that chewed up a lot of the curriculum and didn't leave enough time
                    for the other course work to earn a degree.</p>
                <p>I went to Georgetown. I bought a car and drove across country. I got to
                    Washington D.C. on the first of July, early in the morning. I drove across the
                    14th Street Bridge just at dawn and I'll never forget the thrill of that moment
                    coming across the bridge. The woods of Virginia came right down to the shore of
                    the Potomac in those days, so when you came on the old Fourteenth Street bridge
                    suddenly the whole landscape, the whole profile, of Washington opened out for
                    you with the Jefferson Memorial on the left, Haines Point on the right, the
                    Capitol over there, and the Washington Monument. It was just a tremendous thrill
                    to be there and to see in reality all of the things that I had been interested
                    in, studied about, learned about in school, and so on.</p>
                <p>I went up to Georgetown and found directions to a place called Randall House at
                    21st and N Street, Northwest. It was a rooming house that was full of university
                    students and civil servants, all lower ranking GS fours, fives, sevens,
                    whatever, young people like myself. There were four to six people to a room, $35
                    a month, no meals, just a place to sleep. It was run by an old army master
                    sergeant.</p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>I went up to Georgetown to register and that was where the first disappointment
                    came along because the curriculum that I had followed in my navy training did
                    not correspond very closely to the curriculum of the Georgetown School of
                    Foreign Service. Something like 40 of my 132 credits were applicable to
                    Georgetown's requirements for a Bachelor's degree from the School of Foreign
                    Service. That meant that I would have had to spend somewhere on the order of
                    another six semesters earning a bachelors degree. My GI bill would not cover all
                    of that. That was very discouraging for me. I also had a run-in with one of the
                    professors out there, a logic professor, and he cut my grade a full grade point
                    because of our disagreement, which did not have anything do to with what I
                    accomplished in the course, and that was very discouraging. I did take Russian
                    101 and 102 - - the “in” language in those days. The class met for two and one
                    half hours five nights a week in the old Howard Johnson building on 37th Streeso
                    called because Howard Johnson had donated it - - on the condition that one of
                    the cupolas that decorated all his restaurants would be placed on the roof. The
                    building had no air conditioning or electric fans of any kind. On some July and
                    August evenings the heat was stifling. But we accepted that as normal. The
                    professor was a Dr. Zouvsky, at that time on the staff of the Library of
                    Congress. A graduate assistant, a first generation American of Russian ancestry
                    from Pennsylvania, conducted the class four nights each week. Zouvsky did so on
                    Friday evenings, and he led us in signing Russian folk songs. It was good
                    vocabulary and pronunciation practice, so I think Zouvsky had a good idea about
                    this aspect of language learning. He worked very hard at directing the class,
                    which had a large enrollmen25 or 30, as I recall. By the end of the evening, his
                    shirt would be soaked through with perspiration and his handlebar mustache
                    drooped from the exertion of conducting his choral instruction.</p>
                <p>But I was restless, and discouraged at Georgetown, and I just didn't quite see
                    how my studies would lead to my getting into the Foreign Service, given the long
                    curriculum I would have t follow. It's a funny thing but I don't think that I
                    met anybody who was in the Foreign Service at that time. I don't think I had met
                    anybody in Washington who was in the Department of State. I'm not even sure that
                    I went down to the Department of State to see it at that time. Maybe I did, but
                    I don't recall that. No, I probably did not. I don't remember talking with
                    anybody in Georgetown on the faculty about the Department of State at all, or
                    talking to anybody who was a candidate. There was one guy, Richard Vine, now a
                    retired Foreign Service officer, who lived at Randall House in those days. He
                    was a senior at Georgetown as I recall. He ran the telephone switchboard in
                    Randall House. I've seen Dick Vine a few times since. He was, I think, about the
                    only person who was aiming for the Foreign Service with whom I had any contact
                    at that time. He is the only one that I can recall.</p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>Anyway, at the end of the summer I was very discouraged and I called up Howard
                    Matheny, the Dean of Men at the University of New Mexico. Matheny had been one
                    of the officers in the Navy unit when I was there a couple of years previously,
                    and I said I would like to come back. I described my situation to him. He said,
                    “Well Cunningham, you are late for registration. Classes are beginning in a day
                    or two, but anyway get out here as fast as you can and I'll see what I can do
                    for you.” I sold my car, used the proceeds to buy a plane ticket, and flew out
                    to Albuquerque. I completed the course work that was necessary for a bachelor's
                    degree in that semester. And then what? I didn't know what I was going to do. I
                    had sort of forgotten about diplomatic service at that point, but I did think I
                    wanted to be in government service.</p>
                <p>My transfer back to the University of New Mexico greatly disappointed my parents.
                    They had helped me gain admission to Georgetown, and they were hopeful and proud
                    of my enrollment there. As strong and faithful Catholics, they wanted all of
                    their children to have the advantage of a Catholic university education. My
                    sister and brother later did graduate from Catholic institutions of higher
                    learning. I am the one who missed out. But they were loving parents, and they
                    reconciled themselves to my decision, and I think my father may have understood
                    better than my mother. The first medical school in which he enrolled (the
                    University of Southern California) lost its accreditation during his second year
                    there. He had to repeat that year as a condition of acceptance by another
                    medical school (St. Louis University).</p>
                <p>As I neared the end of my last undergraduate semester at New Mexico, I did not
                    know what I would do afterwards. I had no goal. I was walking down the corridor
                    in the Administration Building one day, this was December of 1947 by this time,
                    and the Dean of General Studies, who also had been an officer in the naval unit
                    previously, Dr. Harold Reid, came out of his office. He saw me walking down the
                    corridor and he said, “Cunningham, come into my office. I want to talk to you.”
                    I went in and he said, “What are you planning to do? Are you graduating soon?” I
                    said, “Yes, at the end of January.” “What are you going to do?” I said, “I don't
                    know. I don't have any idea.” He said, “Why don't you go for a masters degree?”
                    I was stunned. I did not consider myself graduate student material.</p>
                <p>Q: One has to point out that in this era, which we both belong to, masters
                    degrees weren't as prevalent by any means. This was something really extra.
                    Basically you got your bachelors degree and out you went.</p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>CUNNINGHAM: Yes, that is right, and the master's degree candidates whom I knew on
                    campus were very highly regarded people. They walked around as sort of exalted
                    authorities. Reed said, “I'll tell you what. If you do it I will see to it that
                    you get a fellowship.” At that time it was something like $100 a month, which
                    would be in addition to the monthly stipend I received under the GI bill. I had
                    enough remaining tuition eligibility under the GI bill to complete a master's
                    degree. I said to him, “Well, I'll think about that and come back and see you.”
                    I went home and told my roommate about it and he said, “Are you out of your
                    mind? Of course you should do it!” Reed had encouraged me also. He said, “Yes,
                    you have the qualities to do it. You can do it. I'm sure you can.” I went back
                    the next morning and said, “Okay, I'll do it.” I started then immediately the
                    next semester in the masters program at the University of New Mexico, again in
                    Government and Public Administration, but this time with a minor in history. I
                    completed that master's program in three semesters.</p>
                <p>I spent the summer of 1948 as a junior reporter for the Albuquerque Tribune,
                    which still publishes, along with the Albuquerque Tribune. (Albuquerque is still
                    a two newspaper town.) I decided to work that summer, and I went around town
                    looking for a job. They weren't plentiful, and students who had acted more
                    quickly than I already filled the available positions. It was my first
                    experience looking for a job, and I was really green at that. I was lucky again.
                    I walked into the Tribune one afternoon in June and introduced myself to the
                    Publisher, Dan Burrows. He talked with me for awhile, and then sent me to talk
                    with George Baldwin, the Managing Editor. The next day Burrows called me up and
                    told me to come down to work the following morning. I was paid $30 a week, and
                    promptly was assigned to writing obituaries. Seven or eight of us worked in a
                    little city room, about the size of a large family room today. That job was very
                    educational because as each of the regular reporters went on vacation, I took
                    over their beat for a week so I got all around the town in the course of a
                    summer. The only two beats I did not cover were Sports and Society. Those two
                    reporters would not allow that. I think that the Sports reporter, Carlos
                    Salazar, did allow me to attend one evening game of the Albuquerque Dukes, the
                    double A baseball team there at the time, and file a very brief accounmainly
                    consisting of box scores.</p>
                <p>That fall I began work on my master's thesis, which was on the regulation of
                    mineral resources in the state of New Mexico. That was very interesting. My
                    research was original, and I traveled all over the State - - to the potash mines
                    around Carlsbad, to the Kennecott Copper open pit mine near Silver City, to the
                    deep well operations in Lea County and the shallow well, small producer
                    operations in Farmington and Artesia, as well as to the Office of Public Lands
                    in Santa Fe, the State capital. I learned all about the Interstate Oil Compact
                    Commission, the regulation of the production of petroleum, and how that was
                    managed to keep the federal government out and in effect to allow the oil
                    industry to police itself. That knowledge became very interesting 30 years later
                    when the oil embargo took place in 1971. I could understand much of what was
                    going on.</p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>Anyway, I was going along thinking I'm going to complete this masters degree and
                    then I'll go into government service somehow or another. I was living with a
                    married couple, a man by the name of Richard Barrett and his wife Shirley who
                    had worked in Washington during the war. Dick Barrett had all kinds of physical
                    disabilities that had made him a 4-F, so he didn't have any military service. He
                    was also a pacifist, so had he been eligible for the draft, he would have sought
                    classification as a conscientious objector. He had ended up at UNRRA, the United
                    Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, during the early days when
                    Fiorello La Guardia, the former mayor of New York, became the director. Dick had
                    met a lot of people in Washington so he was very knowledgeable and a good
                    advisor on how to get into the bureaucracy, the things you should do, and so on.
                    In the spring of 1949 a man by the name of Melbourne Spector who was a close
                    friend of Dick Barrett (they had worked together at UNRRA and he was from
                    Albuquerque) returned...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: His father was a jeweler there, wasn't he?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNNINGHAM: That's right, his father was a jeweler. Mel came back to Albuquerque
                    to marry his high school sweetheart. This was a very big event. He came over to
                    the house one evening to see Dick. Mel at that point was working in the
                    Department of State personnel. He got to talking about the Department of State
                    and the personnel system; how they were expanding and looking for people,
                    promotion from within, and all the of the attractions of working for the
                    Department of State.</p>
                <p>That kind of rekindled my interest so after Mel returned to Washington, I asked
                    Dick for Mel's address and I wrote to him. I'm rather cautious about all of
                    these things. I don't know why I didn't grab him at the moment. At any rate I
                    wrote to Mel and said I would like to hear more about that and really I had been
                    interested for a long time in the Department of State. He sent me a Form 57 and
                    said to fill it out, send it in, and wait. I did that and about a month later
                    the Department of State security investigator came around and interviewed me and
                    other people in town at the newspaper where I had worked, and so on. He checked
                    out my references. I didn't hear anything. I had corresponded with Mel and he
                    said come on into Washington, it looks like a pretty good thing. Dick Barrett
                    encouraged me to do so also. And there was nothing in New Mexico to hold me
                    there, although by then I had become strongly attached to the State, and I still
                    have a great fondness for it.</p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>Off I went to Washington in the summer of 1949, as it turned out right after my
                    parents celebrated their 25th wedding anniversary in California. I again arrived
                    on the first of July and went into the Department of State personnel. They said,
                    “Oh yes, we have all of your papers here. Everything is ready, but we are not
                    hiring. The Congress has not passed the appropriation so there is a freeze on
                    hiring.” I went back to Randall House where I had lived two years previously and
                    found a room again. I got out my portable typewriter and went out and got a
                    bunch of Form-57s, the standard U.S. Government applications form, from the
                    Civil Service Commission, carbon paper, and typed out sets of them. I started
                    out down at the bottom end of Pennsylvania Avenue. I think I went to see my
                    congressman. Dennis Chavez was a senator at that time and I went to see him. His
                    staff aid said I should go to the CIA so I went over and had an appointment here
                    in this building that used to be over by the Department of State. I've forgotten
                    the name of it now.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was on I Street.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNNINGHAM: Right. I had an interview there. Then I started canvassing Federal
                    agencies, beginning at the Federal Trade Commission at the bottom end of
                    Pennsylvania Avenue. It was a very interesting experience. Nobody was hiring so
                    all the personnel officers had time to talk and they passed me on to other
                    people whom they knew at other agencies. I learned a lot about the federal
                    government just through that process.</p>
                <p>Eventually I ended up at the Atomic Energy Commission and they were at that point
                    building Richland, Washington and they needed administrators for this town that
                    they were developing out there, town managers and so on. Those interviews went
                    along very promisingly and late in August, or early September around Labor Day,
                    I received a call from the Atomic Energy Commission and they made a job offer to
                    me. I guess they called me in and they offered me a job but there was something
                    about it and it wasn't definite. Either I didn't accept it at that point, or
                    they didn't make it firm but it looked very good. I went back to Randall House
                    and I found a call from Department of State personnel waiting for me. I called
                    up and they said they were ready to hire and they wanted me on board. The Atomic
                    Energy Commission would have paid me $2,925 a year; that was the salary that
                    they were offering. The Department of State was offering me $2,850 a year as an
                    FSS-13, Foreign Service Staff 13, the lowest rank. Although AEC was more money,
                    State was what I wanted and had for a long time, so I took that.</p>
                <p>I went down a couple days later to the old temporary building on the corner of
                    23rd and C and was sworn in by Marvin Will along with two other people whom I do
                    not recall now, and I was in the U.S. Foreign Service. The interesting thing was
                    up to this point I had heard nothing about the Foreign Service examination. I
                    did not know the distinction between Foreign Service officers and Foreign
                    Service staff. I was brought on as an FSS-13 clerk typist and sent to FSI to
                    polish up my typing skills to be a good clerk in the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You came in when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNNINGHAM: September of 1949. I spent about a month at FSI anthen was sent to
                    Prague to be pouch clerk at the American embassy there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in Prague from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNNINGHAM: From October of 1949 until May of 1950.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was life like there during this time? How did you
                        find liflike there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNNINGHAM: The day that I arrived set the tone for the seven months I spent
                    there. Three of the Foreign Service staff at the Embassy met me at the railway
                    station that evening in October. I had come up from Paris on the Orient Express.
                    With me on the train also were George Speshok and his wife. George was the newly
                    assigned Security Office at the Embassy.</p>
                <p>The Embassy group that met us at the railway station said, “Welcome to Prague.
                    The Third Secretary of Embassy (Ike Patch) has been declared persona non grata
                    and has three days to get out. A civilian (a naturalized American of Czech
                    birth) has been arrested as a spy and is in jail.” And they told me something
                    similar had happened to a third Embassy staff member. Then they said, “Now we're
                    going to the party.” Off we went to the home of Dale and Sarah Fisher. The
                    Fishers were a very popular and respected couple. Dale was either third or
                    second secretary of the Embassy, I believe in the Political Section. The Fishers
                    had two or three children at the time. They acted as elder brother and sister to
                    the young singles, like myself, in the Embassy. By the time we arrived from the
                    railway station the party was in full swing. I remember it as a lively and
                    cheerful gathering, and I particularly remember the warmth and friendliness with
                    which the Fishers welcomed me. Dale Fisher was killed in an airliner crash in
                    Ethiopia a few years later. Several years later I returned to the Department on
                    consultation from overseas, and there was Sarah Fisher managing the Foreign
                    Service Lounge. She remembered me immediately and welcomed me with the same
                    generosity and sincerity with which she had received me into her home on my
                    first evening in Prague. She and Dale were truly fine people, loved by all who
                    knew them, and devoted to the Foreign Service and its people.</p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>I found Prague very grim, although not so much for myself. First of all we were
                    conscious of being under constant surveillance, all of the time. I had to live
                    in the Alcron Hotel for a long time. You could not go out and rent a house just
                    off the market, you had to have permission from the Foreign Ministry to find a
                    house and there was some kind of rigmarole that was involved though I don't
                    recall the particulars now. Government permission was necessary and it was
                    granted for only a limited period of time. There was one woman, Ann Stoyak, who
                    later married Norman Getsinger, a Foreign Service officer and Chinese language
                    officeAnn is now deceased sadlwho was moved 13 times. Ann was fluent in Slovak,
                    and she was a first generation American, I think from Pittsburgh. Her family had
                    come from Carpathia, as I recall, now a part of Ukraine. Ann wanted to visit her
                    Grandmother who was still living there. Carpathia, then on the border of the
                    Soviet Union, was considered a sensitive area. I don't recall whether a travel
                    permit was required to go there, but it definitely was a place where the Czech
                    authorities didn't want Slovak-speaking Americans roaming around. I think Ann
                    did make it down there, and that made her highly suspect in the mind of the
                    Czech authorities. So they constantly forced her to move. They were really
                    trying to get her out of the country. There were those conditions for one thing
                    that were very depressing in a way.</p>
                <p>The people in the embassy were really remarkable. Everybody had a university
                    degree it seemed to me in those days regardless of rank and regardless of
                    position. There was very little differentiation on a personal level between
                    ranks. We were all friends. The morale was extremely high and there was very
                    great solidarity. Many people were very kind to me. I remember particularly Mary
                    Vance Trent, who was third secretary in the embassy at that time, who was
                    somebody who encouraged me a great deal. Also Sydney Sober who was a political
                    officer was there at that time. There was very strong solidarity and no
                    apartness of any kind based on rank or anything else.</p>
                <p>We had very little contact with the Czechs although there was one guy, Jack
                    Crockett (Thomas J. Crockett, III), a USIA cultural officer, who I thought was
                    quite remarkably adept at getting to know people in the Czech community and had
                    a very broad range of contacts who knew a lot about what was going on. I did not
                    get to know any Czechs on a personal basis except Mrs. Tumova, who owned the
                    apartment in which we were housed by the Czech authorities. It was a very
                    elegant apartment in downtown Prague. Her way of protecting her ownership of
                    that apartment was to have foreign diplomats living there, and she kept house
                    for them. The Czech people at that time, their manner was very downcast and
                    pessimistic. This is kind of a trait, I understand, among the Czechs, who tend
                    to look upon the gloomy side of life just naturally.</p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>In any case, there was nothing in the shops to speak of except in the shops where
                    you used foreign exchange. My recollections of Prague in those days were of
                    people all draped in black trudging back and forth along snow-covered streets. I
                    was there at a bad time of the year. It was wintertime. I arrived in October and
                    left in May so I saw Prague in its least attractive time of year; gloomy, short
                    days, and smoke in the air from industrial plants located all around the rim of
                    the city added to the gloom.</p>
                <p>On the other hand I used to go on various little guided tours. Prague is a great
                    outdoor museum and it was just a thrill to be in this medieval European city
                    with artwork on every corner. In that sense it was a tremendous education and
                    advantage to me, a real opening. I was just a country boy from California. I had
                    been east of the Mississippi only twice and this was the second time. I had
                    never been outside of U.S. territory in my life. This was a great thrilling
                    experience for me to see all of that. I studied some Czech and I found that an
                    extremely difficult language. I had already by that time studied Latin, Spanish,
                    French, and Russian, so Czech really seemed very tough with all the case endings
                    and the nuances in them.</p>
                <p>There are only two events that stand out in my memory as relieving in any way
                    this kind of atmosphere of gloom. One of them was one evening when we went to
                    hear one of the orchestras in Prague. I don't think it was the philharmonic; I
                    think it was one of the radio orchestras. A visiting Italian conductor led the
                    orchestra, and it played at the conservatory. Here were all the students lined
                    up on a balcony behind the orchestra watching the musicians perform. They were
                    young, about my age, and that attracted my interest. The Sorcerer's Apprentice
                    was one of the works on the program that evening. Afterwards the man who ran the
                    commissary in the embassy who had a doctorate of history or something, met us
                    outside and asked us how we liked the performance. We said it was very exciting.
                    He said, “I'm sure the audience understands it. You know” he said, “the story is
                    of a revolution.” His implication was that the Czechs wanted to throw off the
                    shackles of the Russians, but the Czechs were not prepared to do that by
                    themselves at that point at all.</p>
                <p>The other was one evening when Jack Crockett took me to a high school graduation
                    of some friend of his or some contact of his in the class; I don't remember the
                    circumstances. He told me it was a black tie affair. We went through these dark
                    and gloomy streets of Prague and into this auditorium, this ballroom, and it was
                    aglow everywhere with crystal chandeliers. Here were people dressed in formal
                    dress. It was like the top-notch social event of the year. The parents were all
                    in the boxes around the side admiring their daughters and sons down below.
                    Everybody was wearing jewels. I had never seen such splendor or elegance, or
                    such a display of wealth. I couldn't understand how people could dare to do this
                    under the circumstances in Prague with this terrible oppressive atmosphere that
                    you felt everywhere. I've never been able to reconcile that or explain that to
                    myself ever since. I guess I commented on it to Jack and I don't remember what
                    he told me about it. I suppose some day I should get back to him and ask him to
                    explain all that to me.</p>

                        from the Czech secret police?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNNINGHAM: It was a concern always for everybody in the embassy but it never
                    happened to me. We all felt that we were constantly watched and followed. There
                    were black Skoda automobiles all over the city, which were said to be owned by
                    the secret police. Everywhere there were guys in black leather long coats that
                    were said to be members of the secret police. It was nothing at all unusual to
                    be walking down the street and find other people so garbed walking along the
                    street behind you or otherwise. You did feel this constant sense of fear and
                    apprehension everywhere.</p>
                <p>One evening in the hotel room I was talking with Mary Vance Trent and I made some
                    remark. She tried to keep the conversation away from what I was talking about
                    because it was assumed that the hotel room was bugged. One night about 2:00 A.M.
                    one of the code clerks who lived in the Alcron received a call from the embassy
                    guard saying a NIACT, a night action message, had come in and he would have to
                    come in and decrypt the thing. The clerk got dressed and went downstairs. As he
                    walked into the lobby from the elevator the desk clerk said, “Your taxi is at
                    the door.” The clerk had not called for a cab nor given the desk any prior
                    indication he would be going out. There were other incidents of that kind.</p>

                <p>CUNNINGHAM: Right, and maybe a little more about the evacuation froPrague.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is the 4th of June, 1998. Bill can we talk about
                        thevacuation from Prague in 1950?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>The seven months I was in Pragufrom October 1949 to May 1950 coincided with a
                    period when our relations with the Czechs very seriously deteriorated. There
                    were constant allegations in the press that the U.S. was spying on
                    Czechoslovakia. In January of 1950, the authorities arrested two senior local
                    employees of USIS. Eventually the Czechs charged them with espionage. Of course
                    this was the early years of the communist regime in Czechoslovakia, which turned
                    out to be very Stalinistic. They were charged with espionage and were put on
                    trial as I recall in March or April of 1950. In the course of that trial, which
                    lasted for several weeks, virtually everyone of any importance in the embassy
                    was alleged to be a spy. A lot of that came about through rigged questions that
                    were put to these two Czech employees. They were eventually sentenced and then
                    the trial was over.</p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>In late April of 1950 a Foreign Ministry courier delivered a note to the embassy
                    about 3:00 P.M. one Friday afternoon. I was by that time working in the file
                    room of the embassy. The routine always was first to send the Ministry's notes
                    up to the file room for them to be logged in, and then to send them downstairs
                    to an appropriate action officer. Two things about this note were unusual, and
                    their importance was realized only in retrospect. The first was that it had
                    arrived late, and with no fanfare or indication of priority. The second was that
                    it came without an English translation. The Foreign Ministry had not followed a
                    consistent practice with respect to accompanying translations. Sometimes they
                    were provided; sometimes not. The pattern was entirely random. My colleague,
                    Patricia Mostosky, (now Mrs. Peter W. Bush of Seattle, Washington) and I logged
                    the note in, and we sent it downstairs to the Czech language officer in the
                    Embassy; we had three or four of them I guess. Somebody looked at it, made kind
                    of a cursory translation about it, and said “They are demanding that we reduce
                    our staff by two thirds,” and that word filtered back upstairs to Patricia and
                    me. The embassy shut down at the end of the day, completely normally, and
                    everybody went off for the weekend. They said we will take care of this when we
                    get back on Monday. I do suppose, though I do not recall for sure, that a
                    summary of the content on the note was sent by telegram to Washington.</p>
                <p>That weekend, as a matter of fact, a number of us went up to a villa that we had
                    near the Polish border. It had belonged to some wealthy Czech family and had
                    been made available through a complicated process to the American embassy as an
                    R&amp;R spot so that it would stay out of the hands of the Czech government; so
                    that it would not be taken over by the Czech authorities. We were up there and
                    nobody paid much attention to this. We had a good time and all came back to
                    town.</p>
                <p>Work began in a very normal way the following week. Word got around that this
                    note demanded that we reduce our staff by two thirds because the state of
                    relations between Czechoslovakia and the United States as indicated by this
                    trial no longer justified representation of the level that we had there. There
                    were about 85 Americans in the embassy at the time and about 120 local Czech
                    employees.</p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>Somebody said, I guess we should start getting rid of some of these files here,
                    so I started cleaning out some files and looking for some things that weren't
                    particularly important. There was a lot of stuff. I did know that one burned
                    files when embassies were evacuated so I was kind of waiting for these
                    instructions but nobody was very excited. As an aside it is very interesting
                    that an FSS-13, which is what I was at the time, although I did have a masters
                    degree in government and public administration and had served a year in the Navy
                    as a commissioned officer, was allowed that much discretion to just weed stuff
                    out and discard it. I'm not really sure we made all the right judgments at the
                    time. We had something like 15 or 20 bar-lock filing cabinets that were crammed
                    full of stuff all the way from unclassified to I guess top secret, though I'm
                    not sure. Work went on in a very desultory fashion for the week. I do recall,
                    and I thought it a bit odd, that no response to the Foreign Ministry's note went
                    out from the embassy all week. I also was not aware of any cable traffic back
                    and forth to Washington. I suppose one should keep in mind that most
                    communication went by diplomatic pouch in those days. We did not have electronic
                    transmission facilities in the embassy. Once telegrams were encrypted, they were
                    taken to the telegraph office and sent to Washington. Also, we had a budget for
                    telegrams, so the pressure was on to keep them short and few in number. Friday
                    afternoon the week after the note had arrived, the ambassador was summoned over
                    to the Foreign Ministry.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The ambassador was who?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNNINGHAM: Ellis O. Briggs. He was a Latin Americanist - - had spent his entire
                    career in that area. His last post before Prague had been Montevideo, where he
                    had been Ambassador. Briggs went to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and they
                    said to him, “We sent you a note.” He said, “Yes, I got the note.” (This is
                    hearsay. This is what I was told was said.) “We sent the note back to Washington
                    and we are waiting for further instructions.” They said, “Well we want you to
                    reduce your staff by two thirds in all categories,” which meant also the Czech
                    employees, “within a reasonable time.” (Ambassador Briggs said, “We are working
                    on that.” They said, “Reasonable time expires at midnight Monday and we can not
                    be responsible for the security of your staff after that time.” The ambassador
                    protested saying this was not reasonable, and so on and so forth. I saw the
                    reporting telegram of the ambassador's conversation with the ministry so now I
                    am citing from recollection. It made a very deep impression on me at the time.
                    They said, “When you shut down our consulates in Chicago, Cleveland, and
                    Baltimore, you gave us ten days. We protested and you said that was reasonable
                    time. Reasonable time is 10 days from the day you got the note. That is midnight
                    Monday and we will not be responsible for the safety and security of your
                    personnel.” The ambassador protested some more and they said, “Look here, you
                    are not dealing with Uruguay any longer. You are dealing with a fraternal
                    socialist country,” etc., etc. and they carried on in this fashion.</p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>There was panic in the embassy when the information of this meeting at the
                    Foreign Ministry got around the corridors. Briggs came back to the embassy and
                    drafted a highly classified telegram, which requested instructions. The code
                    room in the embassy was right next to the file room. You had to go through the
                    file room to get to the code room. Although Patricia Mostosky and I were never
                    allowed in there because we didn't have the proper clearances, we could hear
                    those code machines clattering and making all the racket that they used to make
                    through the doors. The Ambassador's telegram, which he classified Top Secret,
                    came up after a while from his office and was taken in the code room. By then I
                    think it was well past closing time.</p>
                <p>A man by the name of John Horan, a Boston Irishman, was the chief code clerk and
                    also responsible for control of all Top Secret messages. He was a fairly
                    bureaucratic fellow, as I recall, sticky about all sorts of things that the rest
                    of us thought were kind of picky. His assistant was a woman by the name of Grace
                    Edwards who now lives in Arizona. She was a close friend and roommate, as a
                    matter of fact, of Patricia Mostosky who was my colleague in the file room. I
                    believe they owned a car together.</p>
                <p>When Briggs' telegram arrived for encryption and Grace Edwards read it, her eyes
                    just grew wide in amazement. We were all very young people and Grace, who grew
                    up on a farm in a very rural part of Oregon, wondered what in God's name is
                    going to happen to us now? Here she is the roommate of the file clerk and she
                    knows about this but what about her roommate? Obviously everybody is going to be
                    affected in some way and so far as we knew Tuesday morning would find us all in
                    a Czech jail someplace. That was Grace's thinking at the time. I should add that
                    Grace was no shrinking violet. She was not so much frightened as astounded.
                    Nothing like this had ever happened in the part of Oregon where she had grown
                    up. Grace persuaded John to call the two of us (Patricia and me) in and they
                    showed us this message. John said, “You can not say anything at all about this,
                    absolutely nothing at all about this message.” Out it went.</p>
                <p>I am trying to remember, that evening after work we all went off to a nearby pub
                    to have dinner and a couple of beers. There were four of us in the group one of
                    whom was Ann Stoyak.</p>
                <p>At any rate, the four of us were having a beer and unspoken on our minds was this
                    situation and our concern, apprehension, tension, and excitement about what was
                    going on. In the bar we dared not say a word about it so we talked about other
                    things; I have no idea what we talked about. . I remember only that none of us
                    dared to say a word about the situation of which we now were aware or in any way
                    let on in public that anything was going on. This was not something of which we
                    had to remind one another or pledge one another. It was a sort of unspoken,
                    conscious compact.</p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>What I do remember about that evening was that there was a young Czech soldier in
                    the bar and he invited Ann to dance with him and they did a fantastic czardas
                    there in the bar, then somehow or another we all went our way home. I think
                    everybody was summoned into the embassy Monday morning. The ambassador convened
                    a meeting of the staff to tell them what had happened and that we were going to
                    have to carry out this evacuation. I think the sequence of events is that Briggs
                    reported the note to the Department of State. A reply came back with
                    instructions to press for an additional period of time. He got agreement from
                    the Foreign Ministry for an extension of another ten days, which carried us well
                    into May up to the 10th of May. After these instructions had come back and an
                    extension had been obtained, a meeting of the entire American staff of the
                    embassy was convened. The ambassador explained to us what was going on. What I
                    remember very distinctly is that Briggs broke down in tears in this meeting and
                    apologized to the staff for what had happened to them. He was clearly unable to
                    continue to conduct that meeting, and I do not recall that he gave us any
                    direction or instructions as to how to proceed.</p>
                <p>The other thing that I remembered is that the ambassador at that point left the
                    room. He was ushered out, escorted out, or something. James K. Penfield who was
                    the deputy chief of mission took over the meeting and really took charge. He
                    said, “Okay, this is how we are going to carry it out. You are going to do this.
                    You are going to do that,” and so on. He answered all questions. He was gentle
                    about this, but he was very strong and forthright. I had great respect for Mr.
                    Penfield after that incident. The way in which he took command reassured
                    everyone. It was, I think, a classic example of leadership in a tense and
                    uncertain situation. The United States I suppose had evacuated some diplomatic
                    posts previous to that time, but in the post-war period probably Prague was one
                    of the first where we had to carry out such a large-scale evacuation under that
                    kind of duress.</p>
                <p>In those days we were not accustomed to evacuating diplomatic posts. There wasn't
                    any drill for it and Penfield had to work it all out on his feet. He did a
                    superb job of maintaining morale, organization, discipline, and esprit de corps
                    in the embassy. I give him very high marks for that. I don't know whether he
                    ever got the credit for it that he deserved or not, but he sure as hell did a
                    magnificent job.</p>
                <p>Of course work picked up very quickly in the embassy. We destroyed a lot of files
                    up in the file room. We all knew what we were doing. People's effects had to be
                    gathered together. They had to be packed up and assembled in the embassy. People
                    were assigned various duties and it went off very well. We met the deadline for
                    the evacuation from Prague. Frank Siscoe was the Administrative Officer at that
                    time, and he was another strong, calm figure in these uncertain
                    circumstances.</p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>The Czechs left it to us to select the people to leave. Of course just about all
                    of the American staff volunteered to stay and we were thanked for that, but
                    about 60 of us had to leave. I was among those whom the embassy and Washington
                    decided should go. It was a particularly tragic situation in the case of the
                    Czech employees of the embassy because many of them were people who had worked
                    in the embassy since the '20s and '30s. They had been with the embassy since the
                    founding of it. When the Second World War came, the embassy was shut down of
                    course. The Czech employees had in many cases been very helpful to people
                    leaving at that time. They had remained loyal. They had come back to the embassy
                    when it reopened in 1945 and some of them were just short of eligibility for
                    retirement by 1950. A lot of compassionate work was done I understand at that
                    point trying to solve the problems of those people. Upon leaving the embassy,
                    they were going to be sent off to labor camps somewhere under the work permit
                    system that the Czech government had. They were assigned to very mundane
                    positions of drudgery in humiliating conditions. One, a very senior employea
                    silver-haired gentleman, said to me “You have the atomic bomb. Why don't you
                    just drop it on the Kremlin and solve the whole problem?” I was dumbfounded by
                    his statement, and I don't recall what I said, although it showed me the state
                    of his desperation and distress.</p>
                <p>I remember very well a young man by the name of Karel Prohaska, who was one of
                    the chauffeurs of the embassy and was somehow associated with my roommate at the
                    time, a man by the name of Keith Corley, who was in the military attach�'s
                    office. Karel was about my age, a young fellow. I remember talking with him one
                    of the last afternoons that I was in the embassy. He was there with his
                    girlfriend in a vacated Embassy office. I said to him, “Karel, you've been
                    awfully good to me.” His English was quite good; I spoke no Czech. “If there is
                    anything I can ever do to help you out, let me know.” His girlfriend immediately
                    hushed us and pointed to the telephone. Here we were in the American embassy and
                    there was such a climate of fear on the part of people that she believed that it
                    was entirely possible that the telephone on the desk between us was tapped, even
                    though it was on the hook, and that people would be able to pick up the
                    transmission of what we were saying.</p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>I have no idea what happened to Karel Prohaska or any of the other people in the
                    embassy at that time. There were some who escaped. I saw one month later in
                    Paris. She was the fianc� and later married a captain in the air force attach�'s
                    office. Her story was a chilling example of risks people took, I suppose some
                    unsuccessfully, to escape from behind the Iron Curtain. She said that she had
                    paid someone to get her out of the country by crossing over the border. They had
                    escorted her on a certain day, followed by a moonless night, all this business,
                    up to a point that was something like three or four miles from the border at
                    which point they said to her, “Okay, now you head in that direction through the
                    woods.” She did as she was told and after awhile, through the darkness, she saw
                    a guard approaching as she was getting very close to the border. She said she
                    turned her back toward him and crouched down on the ground to look as though she
                    was part of the vegetation and kind of blend with it. She said, “I waited a long
                    time. I expected him to come up from behind and take me. After a very long time
                    nothing happened and I looked around and no one was there. I have no idea
                    whether he saw me and decided to allow me to go, or whether he didn't see me and
                    I was successful.” She said she then crossed the border. It was a real ordeal,
                    that experience.</p>
                <p>We were evacuated to Frankfurt, Bad Homburg as a matter of fact, in West Germany.
                    Patricia Mostosky, Grace Edwards, and I rode in Patricia's car down first to
                    Nuremberg, then to Frankfurt, which was the designated collection point for us.
                    People went various ways. Many of them drove personal automobiles loaded up with
                    as many belongings as they could and went on their way. I guess some others were
                    flown out, and some went out on the attach�'s plane. It wasn't the kind of
                    evacuation you have now where the Marines come in and you have an air force
                    transport unit lifting everybody out. You were on your own. It was an adventure
                    and it was very exciting for us.</p>
                <p>Patricia, Grace and I got to Frankfurt late in the day, as I recall. We parked
                    downtown, outside of one of the HICOG operated hotels and went in to check in
                    and get some dinner. We had arrived, and we felt safe and relieved. Then one of
                    the unfortunate things happened. Patricia's car, parked outside had the backseat
                    full mostly of clothing and personal items belonging to Grace and Patricia. My
                    stuff had been loaded in the trunk of the car. While we were in the hotel, the
                    car was broken into and everything that was inside the passenger compartment was
                    removed. The girls lost practically all of their clothing and personal belongs
                    at that point. That was a real letdown after we had successfully made our
                    departure.</p>
                <p>We were sent to Bad Homburg as the collection point in Germany for the Embassy
                    evacuees. It's a spa outside of Frankfurt and we were told to wait there for
                    further instructions. I was restless and I thought where are they going to send
                    us? That was the big buzz at the time; where are they going to send us? What's
                    going to happen now? I thought where would I like to be assigned? Of course we
                    all talked about where we would like to be assigned.</p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>By that time I knew enough about U.S. Government bureaucracy to realize that the
                    Department of State would not know what to do with 50 surplus Foreign Service
                    personnel suddenly dumped on its lap in West Germany.</p>
                <p>I had taken one semester of French at the University of New Mexico. I thought
                    there were an awful lot of Americans in Germany. The name of game in those days
                    if you were in the Foreign Service was to get to someplace where there weren't a
                    lot of Americans. We joined the Foreign Service to go abroad, and to be in
                    another American colony, part of a big occupation bureaucracy in Germany, was
                    not attractive at all. We didn't want to do that, or at least some of us didn't,
                    and I didn't. I thought I know French and maybe I can get a job in the embassy
                    in Paris, that would be kind of nice.</p>
                <p>I went out and bought a train ticket to Paris. Other people in the evacuation
                    group said to me, “You had better not do that. We are supposed to stay here. We
                    are under orders.” Well, I violated orders and went to Paris. I went into the
                    American embassy and went up to see the personnel officer and said, “Here I am.
                    I've just been evacuated from Czechoslovakia. I know some French. I have a
                    master's degree in public administration and government. I am available and I
                    would like a job. I've done this work on the Foreign Service staff,” and so on.
                    I said, “I'm not supposed to be here.” He said, “Yes, I understand.” He took
                    down all the particulars and he said, “Go back to Frankfurt and wait.”</p>
                <p>I went back to Bad Homburg and waited. We thought we had about a week to wait for
                    orders, so Patricia, Grace Edwards, and Jack Crockett, who worked for USIA and
                    now is retired and lives up in Connecticut, took a little trip down the Moselle
                    Valley through Trier, Luxembourg, then over to the Meuse Valley, perhaps going
                    through Bastogne and Charleroi, up to Liege, and on to Aachen (or
                    Aix-la-Chapelle), on to Cologne, then down the Rhine Valley back to Bad Homburg.
                    It was a wonderful trip, and I cherish still the memory of visiting the seat of
                    Charlemagne's rule. When we returned I found I had orders to go to Paris so off
                    I went to Paris at the end of May 1950. I was the first of the evacuees from
                    Prague to be reassigned, and everyone was envious - and some asked how I had
                    arranged that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in Paris from 1950 to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNNINGHAM: I was in Paris from May of 1950 to November of 1950. I was first
                    assigned to the budget section of the embassy and worked for a man by the name
                    of Nicholas Fortucci, at the time I believe a local American hire of the
                    Embassy. Nick was a very good boss, had a sparkling sense of humor, and was a
                    good mentor to a young guy like me. Nick's supervisor was a man by the name of
                    Arthur Scharff, the Embassy Budget Officer. Scharff was an opera buff and a wine
                    connoisseur, always going off to some wine tasting experience in the South of
                    France.</p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>After a couple of months I was shifted from the budget section to the accounting
                    section of the embassy where my boss was a woman by the name of Jessie Hairnet.
                    We were under the general supervision of Joseph A. Dagenhart who was the chief
                    disbursing officer at the embassy at that time, and also the chief disbursing
                    officer for all U.S. Foreign Service posts in Western Europe.During the time
                    that I was in Paris the war broke out in Korea and the embassy in Seoul of
                    course was evacuated, but in great disarray. The government fled to Pusan.
                    MacArthur staged his landing on the west coast at Inchon in September of 1950. A
                    short time later the government moved back to Seoul after it was retaken, and
                    the embassy moved back with it.</p>
                <p>That led to my transfer two months later from Paris to Seoul. I'm told I was
                    assigned to Korea solely because I was a bachelor. This is a story which I've
                    been told was true although I've never seen the documentation on it. The
                    ambassador to Korea at that time was John J. Muccio and his deputy was Everett
                    Drumright, an old China hand. Muccio and Drumright at that time both were
                    bachelors and it is reported that they sent a message to the Department of State
                    saying this - - i.e. bachelor status - - as the primary staffing requirement for
                    the embassy, which of course was going to be greatly enlarged in view of the war
                    effort. There was a lot of economic assistance and other things going on.
                    According to the story I was told their cable said, “This is a war zone and it
                    is dangerous. No women or married men should be sent. Send only bachelors to
                    fill all of these positions.” In any case, no families could be sent to Korea,
                    that was for sure, so that was the idea of sending only bachelors.</p>
                <p>I was in Paris and I was a bachelor. On the second of November, Patricia
                    Mostosky, my former colleague in Prague who had by now been assigned to Paris
                    also, and who worked in the Embassy personnel office, called me up and said,
                    “Guess what?” I said, “What?” She said, “We have orders transferring you to
                    Seoul, TM-7.” I said, “Come on, you are kidding me. What's going on here?” She
                    said, “No, come on down here and I will show them to you.” I went down there and
                    sure enough there they were, depart in 10 days.</p>
                <p>I thought it was awfully nice in Paris. I had absolutely no background in Asia. I
                    had not studied Asia. I knew no Asian languages. I had no special interest in
                    it. It was not in my vision to go out there when I joined the Foreign Service,
                    at all. I knew nothing about it. There was no personal or professional
                    qualification or interest that would take me there. I thought about this thing
                    and pondered it a little bit.</p>
                <p>Joe Dagenhart, who was the supervisor of my boss at the time, said to me, “I hear
                    you've got orders to go Korea. That's a war zone. I'm a World War I veteran. I
                    was in Chateau Thierry, Belleau Wood and all those other places. That's
                    dangerous out there. You are a young man. I'm not so sure you ought to do that.”
                    That was really what convinced me because I realized that promotions come faster
                    in war zones than they do elsewhere, and I was anxious to get ahead. So I said,
                    “Well, Mr. Dagenhart, thank you very much. I appreciate that but I believe I
                    should respond to a call of duty.” The idea of going to a war zone did not
                    frighten me.</p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were young. Hell I volunteered.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNNINGHAM: Sure. I had been commissioned by the navy. I had gone through the
                    navy officer training program so I wasn't a neophyte so far as military affairs
                    were concerned. Off I went on something like the 10th of November, as I recall,
                    or the 12th. I made the ten day departure. I guess it was the 12th of November
                    that I left Paris for Seoul via Rome where I had to pick up a British Overseas
                    Airways Corporation DC-4 all the way out to Tokyo. That trip was an adventure it
                    itself because we stopped at various places. We got stuck in Bangkok because the
                    plane fell behind schedule. Night landings were not permitted in Hong Kong, our
                    next stop, in those days, so we had to stay over for a while. A bunch of us who
                    were dog tired by then and hadn't had any sleep for three days on the DC-4
                    boarded a bus and went down and took a night tour of Bangkok. We came back and
                    got on the plane at something like 3:00 in the morning and flew off to Hong
                    Kong. I was getting a real introduction to Asia.</p>
                <p>I arrived in Tokyo after dark on the evening of the day we left Bangkok at 3:00
                    A.M. So here I was in Tokyo; now how do I get to Korea? Of course these were
                    Occupation days. I suppose I had a Transportation Request for my onward travel
                    to Korea, but I had no idea how to get there. Nor did I have a hotel
                    reservation. I asked for the American embassy but there was no American embassy
                    while Japan was under Occupation. Here I've got these orders and I'm supposed to
                    go to Korea. I haven't got a ticket that takes me there. Where do I find some
                    place to sleep? How do I find a hotel? The Occupation was running everything in
                    Japan at that point and so I ended up at the Provost Marshal's office in
                    downtown Tokyo and somehow or another got myself righted around. It took me
                    about a week to finally to get a booking on a Northwest flight into Seoul.</p>
                <p>I'm not sure what I did during that week in Tokyo. Most of it I spent trying to
                    get to Korea. What I do remember is that somebody got a hold of me and said,
                    “Now listen, they are very strict about things over there. You are wearing
                    civilian clothes and that's a military zone. You had better go down to the PX
                    and get yourself outfitted with a uniform. You've got to be in a uniform if you
                    go over there.” I said, “But I'm in the American embassy.” “It doesn't make any
                    difference. MacArthur (who in addition to being the Supreme Commander of Allied
                    Powers in the Pacific Theater also was the Commander of United Nations forces in
                    Korea) says everybody has got to be in uniform in Korea. You don't want to get
                    shot or arrested as a North Korean spy.”</p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>I went with my meager travel allowance down to the PX, which was located in Ginza
                    in what is now Mitsukoshi Department Store there on the main corner. The
                    interesting thing I remember is that afternoon Claude Pepper, at that point U.
                    S. Representative from Florida, was in the PX and he was on his way to Korea. He
                    was being outfitted completely. Of course he had a very generous allowance so he
                    was getting the whole regalia. I bought a pair of khaki pants or something, and
                    a shirt. They kept telling me that this was not enough; I needed more than that.
                    I think I bought a warm jacket.</p>
                <p>Off I went to Korea eventually and I was put into the personnel office of the
                    embassy there. Louis Benjamin was the chief of administration. We were busy as
                    beavers trying to get things lined up to ship more Americans in and staff this
                    embassy, which was at that time located in the Banto Hotel in downtown Seoul;
                    that is where it had been before the North Korean invasion in June 1950. The top
                    three floors of the hotel were quarters for the embassy staff so I was roomed up
                    there. I had a room to myself and I was fairly comfortable. The officers club
                    was on the top floor of the building. We used to gather up there in the evenings
                    at 6:00 to listen to the AFRS, Armed Forces Radio Service news broadcast from
                    Tokyo. It was a 6:00 p.m. broadcast and was our main source of information about
                    the progress of the war.</p>
                <p>I arrived in Seoul about a week before Thanksgiving and I remember the
                    Thanksgiving edition of Stars and Stripes. The banner headline was “We Stand on
                    the Yalu” and that was the point. That was the high tide of the U.N.-U.S.
                    military campaign into North Korea. They had gotten all the way up to the Yalu
                    River, the border between Korea and China, about that time. We stood there for
                    about 24 hours and then the Chinese came in and the whole retreat began. As I
                    said, I spent the first two weeks in this personnel office trying to get things
                    set up to ship people into Korea and staff the embassy. After the retreat from
                    the Yalu began, things turned around and I spent the rest of my time in Korea
                    shipping people out as fast as I could.</p>
                <p>I remember from that time, and it was quite a traumatic experience, seeing
                    truckload after truckload of U.S. army trucks of soldiers coming through Seoul,
                    right through an intersection about one block from the Embassy, headed south - -
                    across the Han River. You have to understand that the ground freezes by the end
                    of November in Korea. It is a cold place. These soldiers were standing up in
                    open trucks being moved from the north of Seoul, through Seoul, and across the
                    Han River. These poor fellows were dazed. Here was the great victorious American
                    army and they did not know what had hit them with the Chinese coming into the
                    war in the north. It was a very disturbing experience to see this happening.</p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>The main Army post exchange was right across the street from the Embassy, and it
                    was having sales all the time because it was collecting stock from all the post
                    exchanges that were closing down elsewhere up in the front echelons and selling
                    it off as fast as they could. There were all kinds of bargains. Finally about
                    the middle of December the Post Exchange itself closed down and they pulled out.
                    I remember quite vividly the last Sunday that I was in Seoul, the chapel where
                    the military chaplains held Sunday services was located on the floor above the
                    post exchange. I went over to I guess 9:00 mass or something like that to the
                    chapel. At the end of mass the priest said, “The mass is ended, go in peace. We
                    are leaving right after this service. I don't know where you guys are going to
                    go to mass next Sunday but it won't be here.” I thought to myself, well if the
                    Post Exchange is gone, the army chaplains have pulled out, the American embassy
                    is still here. What's going on? By this time you could hear gunfire in the hills
                    at night around the city.</p>
                <p>The Koreans were trying to get out. We evacuated a lot of our Korean national
                    employees. Being in the personnel office I helped with part of that too. I went
                    out one morning, I think it was a Saturday morning, to the rail yards where they
                    were going to have a train to take our people south. I was expecting passenger
                    cars to take our local employees (they are known nowadays by the title of
                    Foreign Service Nationals) many of whom were very well educated people, cultured
                    people. What they brought in for them was a whole string of cattle cars. I
                    thought this is just unacceptable. There was manure all over the floor of these
                    things. It was frozen hard, caked, but I thought we can't let the people in
                    there. I grabbed a shovel and started shoveling it out. Somebody said to me,
                    “No, no, no. Leave it alone. That is insulation. It will keep us warm going
                    south.” Recently in Texas I met a Korean woman who was a child of one of the
                    local employees of the American embassy staff and she had a recollection of that
                    evacuation that Saturday morning in 1950.</p>
                <p>Q: Was there a concern in personnel to get rid of all the records of anybody
                    associated with the Americans because I understand when our embassy left in June
                    of 1950 there were a lot of records still around which brought very nasty things
                    on those people, like visa applicants, or people associated with the embassy. We
                    hadn't realized how awful it would be. I was wondering whether this was hanging
                    over your head at this time?</p>
                <p>CUNNINGHAM: The part of the office that I worked in dealt with American personnel
                    only. Now that you bring that up, that rings a bell of some kind. I do remember
                    hearing of those incidents although in what connection I can't really recall. I
                    can't say. I just cannot certify as to whether there was an organized attempt to
                    do that in the embassy. If there was, or if there wasn't, either way, I am not
                    aware of it particularly.</p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>This brings up another point. We had many male employees and the Korean
                    government was unwilling to allow men of military age to leave the city. There
                    was only one bridge operating across the Han River. On this particular
                    evacuation train that I was speaking of, as I recall, it was women, children,
                    and older men beyond military age. I do not recall any men of military age who
                    were in that group. That is not to say that there weren't any but my
                    recollection is of older people and women and children being in the evacuation
                    group. There was only one bridge operating across the river and there was a very
                    strong effort by people in the city to get out before it fell. I made many trips
                    out to the airport in connection with the evacuation of our American staff and
                    every time I crossed the river there were boats that were ferrying Koreans
                    across the Han River. There was a big crowd on the north bank of the river, and
                    on the south bank of the river there was a solid file of people, practically all
                    women and children. In many instances, it was a woman with a child on the back,
                    another by the hand, and the household belongs balanced on the head.</p>
                <p>That scene of those young women and little children marching south across the
                    treeless mudflats on the south bank of the Han River through the mountain passes
                    to head south and get away is an indelible impression in my mind. Again, it was
                    like the people that I knew in Czechoslovakia who were fleeing tyranny and
                    oppression. These people were doing the same and I remember very well being told
                    at the time that many of them would not make it all the way south; they would
                    freeze to death at night in the mountain passes overcome by fatigue, hunger, or
                    whatever and perish. I was only there until the end of December.</p>
                <p>There was another experience that I had with regard to the evacuation of U. S.
                    personnel. One man had been in Seoul before the attack in June, I think with
                    U.S. Information Agency but I'm not sure. He came back of course when the
                    embassy returned. He had developed very strong ties to Korean society and I
                    think he had a fianc� who was a Korean, and all the rest. The rumor was that
                    this fellow was going to try to stay after the city fell. We wanted to get every
                    single American out; this was towards the end. This was the last week before the
                    city fell at the end of December and he was finally evacuated. It took very
                    strong persuasive effort. A couple of people, I was among them, escorted him out
                    to the airport. All the way out to the airport we kept saying, “You have to go,”
                    and he kept saying, “I want to stay. I have my fianc� here and she has all her
                    relations.” We kept saying, “It is going to be harder on her if you do stay.”
                    Finally, very reluctantly, we got him on the plane. This was a night flight on
                    Northwest Airlines. It left about midnight that night. I was out there on the
                    tarmac helping to get people loaded onto the plane. I think it was more or less
                    the last, or the next to last batch.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're talking about Kimpo airport.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>CUNNINGHAM: Kimpo Airport outside of Seoul. It was a cold, cold night and we kept
                    loading people and baggage onto this plane. The Northwest Airlines man was there
                    next to me. This was either a DC-4 or a DC-6, which was standard at that time.
                    We got this plane loaded up and it was about 11:30. They buttoned up and taxied
                    off to the end of the runway. That plane made the longest takeoff run of any
                    that I have ever seen. It went on, and on, and on, and on, and finally the
                    Northwest Airlines manager standing next to me who realized how heavily loaded
                    that plane was said, “break, break,” hoping it would. Finally it lifted off just
                    short of the end of the runway. We all heaved a sign of relief that it had
                    gotten off safely and the people had gotten off to Tokyo.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we trying to staff a new embassy down in Pusan?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNNINGHAM: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But most were being sent off?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNNINGHAM: Yes. What happened was a field office had been set up in Tokyo for
                    the American mission in Korea. Some of the staff from the embassy were sent to
                    Pusan where we had a consulate and to where the government was going to retreat
                    again, and the rest were sent to Tokyo to staff the field office over there. I
                    was among those designated to go to Tokyo.</p>
                <p>My evacuation was very unusual from Korea. Late in December I started feeling
                    feverish, nauseous, ill, and so on. I didn't know what was wrong with me. For
                    some reason in those days we wanted to stay away from the military hospitals so
                    I turned into the Seventh Day Adventist Hospital in Seoul. The head of it was a
                    man by the name of Dr. Roux who had been a long time medical missionary in
                    Korea. They examined me and they were rather concerned. Finally they did a
                    spinal tap on me and they said, “You have symptoms that resemble meningitis and
                    the cell count in your spinal fluid is up. We think you should be evacuated to
                    Japan.” Of course the North Koreans were closing in on the city at that point so
                    I was evacuated via marine hospital aircraft to Osaka. The ride in the military
                    ambulance to the airport was just an agonizing experience because those things
                    had no springs and all the roads in Korea were rutted. I really felt sorry for
                    wounded men who have to be evacuated in military ambulances after that
                    experience. I got on the plane. I was kind of woozy and feeling very
                    strange.</p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>I flew to Osaka and we were met and taken to the Osaka military hospital. Here I
                    was with a whole bunch of guys who were war wounded coming back from the front
                    and I was a State Department civilian. I was put in this military hospital. I
                    began to feel much better and whatever it was began to pass and fade away. They
                    looked at me and said, “Why are you here?” I explained the symptoms to them and
                    they said, “Yes, yes, okay.” The first thing I knew, they put me in the
                    psychiatric ward of the hospital. At this point, I began to get kind of worried.
                    I said, “I belong to the Department of State and I'm sure they want to know
                    where I am by now,” because things were getting pretty confused in Seoul by this
                    point, “and I want to speak to the American consul in Osaka.” “Oh, yes, yes,
                    that's all right. We will take care of you here.”</p>
                <p>I protested and I finally got a hold of the American consulate in Osaka. They got
                    in touch with Tokyo and the first thing you know I got a telephone call from
                    Donald McCue, who was in charge of this field office that had been set up in
                    Tokyo for the administrative services for the American mission in Korea. He
                    said, “Cunningham, where in the hell are you and what are you doing there?” I
                    explained the situation to him and he said, “We've been looking all over for
                    you. We've lost you for 48 hours. Nobody knew where you were. We thought you
                    might be in North Korea.” I said, “No, don't worry about that.” He said, “All
                    right. We'll get you out of the hospital. You get on a train up here to Tokyo as
                    quickly as you can.”</p>
                <p>I arrived in Tokyo on Christmas Eve, 1950. I had been two evacuations in one year
                    in the Foreign Service. By this time I had been through three posts in my first
                    year and a half in the Foreign Service. I was then assigned to this Field Office
                    of the American Mission in Korea and continued to work with the personnel people
                    there. It was located in the San Shin building in downtown Tokyo not far from
                    the Dai Ichi building where MacArthur had his headquarters. As a matter of fact
                    it was very close to the Provost Marshal's office where I first checked in the
                    previous November.</p>
                <p>I enjoyed working with those people very much, but the office was shut down then
                    at the end of February, as I recall. The question was, what was going to be done
                    with these Field Office people? Some were going to be sent to Korea. I wanted to
                    be sent back to Korea because that is where I had been assigned. No, they
                    couldn't use me in Korea. They were reducing staff at this point because they
                    didn't have room for them over there in the Embassy, again located in Korea and
                    reduced from the size it had been in Seoul a few months previously. They didn't
                    want to maintain this office in Tokyo any longer either. Things had stabilized
                    somewhat. I was then transferred to the office of the Diplomat Section of SCAP,
                    which was run by William J. Sebald, career FSO, Japanese Language Officer and
                    with the rank of Ambassador at that time.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>CUNNINGHAM: The Supreme Command for Allied Powers, Japan, Douglas MacArthur's
                    headquarters. Japan was still an occupied country. MacArthur was still in the
                    Dai Ichi Building down the street. The Diplomatic Section was what passed for
                    the American embassy. Japan did not have foreign relations. In fact all of the
                    other countries had missions that were accredited to the Diplomatic Section of
                    SCAP and it served as kind of a conduit to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</p>
                <p>This time I was assigned there to the general services section of the Diplomatic
                    Section. We were trying to recapture some of our State Department property from
                    the grip of the occupation forces and to acquire additional property for the
                    eventual American embassy in Japan. I worked on some of that with the property
                    manager and did various things that were not particularly interesting to me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in Tokyo from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNNINGHAM: From December of 1950 until April of 1951. Q: You were saying you
                    were doing general services type work.</p>
                <p>CUNNINGHAM: Yes, in the Diplomatic Section of SCAP from the end of February until
                    April. One day during this period I was down in the coffee bar and James Byrd
                    Pilcher, who was at that time the consul general in charge of the consular
                    section, came up to me and he said, “Young man I've been watching you.” This was
                    the kind of comment that always made a young fellow apprehensive, but Mr.
                    Pilcher (or Jaybird, as his friends called him) was a cheerful and generous man
                    with a bouncy personality. He said, “How would you like some really good
                    consular experience?” I said, “Well, what do you have in mind Mr. Pilcher?” He
                    said, “We need a vice consul up in Sapporo and I think you would do just fine in
                    that job.” Now I have a habit, and it occurred many times in my life prior to
                    the Foreign Service, where I would hesitate and say, I'd like to think that
                    over, so that's what I said to Mr. Pilcher. He said, “Why sure, but I've got to
                    know soon.” I said, “I'll come see you tomorrow.”</p>
                <p>I went home and I talked with my roommate about this. I have a habit of always
                    asking roommates about this kind of thing. He said, “Why don't you take it?” I
                    sort of relied upon my old navy experience and the slogans there was that you
                    get more experience on a small ship and more responsibilities than you do on a
                    big one. It is better to serve on a destroyer or on a minesweeper than it is on
                    a battleship or an aircraft carrier.</p>
                <p>I went back the next morning and I said, “Okay, Mr. Pilcher, I will do this.” I
                    had no idea what Sapporo was like. I had all of these experiences in Korea,
                    Japan, and so on. I said, “Okay, I will do it.”</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You might explain where Sapporo is.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNNINGHAM: Sapporo is the principal city of Hokkaido in northern Japan, in the
                    far north. The entire island of Hokkaido is a single prefecture, and by far the
                    largest in area of all of Japan's prefectures. Sapporo is the Prefectural
                    capital, and the principal city on the island. We had a two-man consulate there.
                    Off I went to Sapporo.</p>
                <p>But before I did something else happened during this period in Tokyo that was
                    very important and influenced the rest of my career. As I said I went to Korea
                    with no background in Asia whatsoever and I didn't really even know what to
                    expect. Despite the fact that it was a war zone, despite the fact that things
                    were terribly troubled, I was quite fascinated by what I found in Seoul and I
                    liked it. I reacted positively to it.</p>
                <p>I was very impressed by what I saw in Japan. I am from California and there was
                    an anti-Japanese bias that was rather strong in California to which I had been
                    subjected, to debunk the capabilities of the Japanese. When I got to Tokyo I saw
                    how by 1950 the Japanese had recovered to that point, restored their city,
                    restored manufacturing capabilities, and were redeveloping their economy. In
                    other words there was a level of development in Japan that impressed me
                    strongly. I compared it to what I had seen in Western Germany where the
                    destruction from wartime bombing was evident everywhere in major cities at that
                    time; it was not evident everywhere in Japan at that time. There were a few
                    places where you could see the damage but you had to look for it in Japan at
                    that time. I was impressed by the industry, by the civility of the Japanese
                    people, and by the sophistication of their whole economic system. I thought this
                    is something important.</p>
                <p>At that time Sophia (Jochi) University, which is one of the principal private
                    universities in Japan, a Jesuit institution founded by German Jesuits, was
                    conducting what they called the International Institute. It was night school.
                    The Department of Army civilians who were working in Occupation Headquarters
                    would conduct courses at Sophia University after work, as they do here in
                    Washington, DC at George Washington and American University.</p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>I decided to enroll in a couple of courses out there. I had time on my hands in
                    the evenings. There wasn't all that much to do and I didn't have that much money
                    to spend. I enrolled in two courses for the spring term at Sofia. One was a
                    course in economics and the other was a course in the history of the modern Far
                    East taught by a man by the name of Lawrence Battistini. Battistini was a Ph.D.
                    in Chinese history from Brown University. He was also the head of the historical
                    division of SCAP. Battistini was a real Sinophile and a man of great enthusiasm
                    and real dramatic flair so that every lecture was a memorable event. He
                    particularly stressed the achievements of Chinese civilization and the great
                    advances that they had made, and how Asia had suffered from the colonial and
                    imperialist intrusions of the late 19th and early 20th century. That was a very
                    strong theme in his course. He made a very deep impression on me. I was not able
                    to finish the course because Pilcher's offer came along in mid-semester so I had
                    to leave to go to northern Japan. That was an experience that really
                    crystallized an interest in Asia in me. Battistini's course started me doing a
                    lot of self-study and reading, and accumulating materials on Asia.</p>
                <p>I went to Sapporo and this was a good experience for me because it gave me a
                    chance to finally do what I considered to be really professional Foreign Service
                    work; the kind of thing that I wanted to do. I wasn't especially interested in
                    doing administrative work because I was more interested in the diplomatic side.
                    In Sapporo we were a very busy consular office. There were just the two of us.
                    The late David Osborn, who later became ambassador to Burma, was the consul
                    there. He was the second consul. William Magistretti had opened the consulate
                    about a year previously. I got the chance to do consular work and Osborn said to
                    me, “Well you took this course in economics at Sophia University so you might as
                    well be the economics reporting officer also.” I took a course though I hadn't
                    finished. That was the extent of my qualifications. We had a young army corporal
                    for the first five or six months that I was there who served as the secretary
                    for the consulate. We had four Japanese local employees including Homma-san, the
                    driver; Takeuchi-san, the principal clerk; Aoki-san, one of the Visa clerks;
                    Takahashi-san, the other Visa clerk; and Terashima-san, principal translator and
                    analyst in the Consulate. Aoki was a war veterahe had been with Japanese
                    infantry in Burma. His father-in-law was a legal U. S. residena dentist in
                    Ogden, Utah. Terashima-san was a debonair man with a Continental air. He was
                    fluent in French and an amateur photographer. He was an older man - - in his
                    fifties. Takeuchi was a young fellow, probably too young to have served in the
                    Japanese forces. He was very Western-oriented and was a square dance aficionado,
                    president of the Sapporo square-dancing society.</p>
                <p>Just at this time the legislation that permitted the regularization of unions
                    between American soldiers and Japanese women had come into effect so we had a
                    steady stream of them coming in. There was a regular routine that had been set
                    up and it was already in operation by the time I got there. There was a military
                    camp on the outskirts of Sapporo, Camp Crawford, and that was where many of
                    these military personnel were stationed. Others of them were stationed in
                    various offices around Hokkaido and in fact northern Honshu. I'm not sure
                    whether our consular district extended there or not.</p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>The regular routine was they would come in with the necessary documentation to
                    have their marriage regularized under Japanese civil law. They would sign
                    documents in the consular office and we would then execute a certificate of
                    witness to a marriage, which provided an official American documentation of this
                    union. That would be the first day. The second day they would come back and file
                    in many cases a report of birth for one, and frequently two children, to certify
                    the American citizenship to which these children were entitled through their
                    fathers. I executed many reports of birth for the children of these unions. The
                    next step was to prepare the non-quota immigration visa for the Japanese spouse
                    and to take an application for a passport. We did not have authority to issue
                    passports. That was reserved to the Consular Section of the Diplomatic Section
                    in Tokyo. We did over 100 of these cases in the one year that I was in Sapporo
                    in that consulate.</p>
                <p>There were all kinds of situations so I really got an exposure to that kind of
                    work. David Osborn did the political reporting. He was a Japanese language
                    officer, and an extremely skilled one; I was not. I took care of the
                    administrative work. After a time the army corporal was transferred elsewhere
                    and we had no one to act as a typist or a secretary so what we really did was
                    our own typing. If there were strikeouts in diplomatic dispatches, there were,
                    that's all there was to it. We couldn't do anything about it. That was a good
                    experience.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there from April of '51 until when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNNINGHAM: Until May of 1952. During my first tour in the Foreign Service, which
                    lasted almost three years, I was in five posts and had about six different jobs.
                    I covered a lot of administrative work and consular work. There was one
                    complication with this appointment to Sapporo. I may have been an FSS-12 by the
                    time this took place. Osborn needed a signing officer, someone with the
                    authority to sign all the consular documents we processed in connection with
                    these marriage cases, so that he could go on field trips and devote himself to
                    political reporting, which was the main reason why he was there. Sapporo was a
                    lookout post - - watching for signs of Soviet efforts to infiltrate either from
                    Sakhalin or the “Northern Territories” the four islands claimed by Japan and
                    occupied by the Soviets off the Northeast tip of Hokkaido</p>
                <p>I got up to Sapporo and they started to process an appointment for me as a vice
                    consul and lo and behold I didn't have sufficient rank to be appointed as vice
                    consul. I had to be at least an FSS-11 or something like that. What they worked
                    out finally after I got there (this was discovered only after I got there) was a
                    temporary promotion to an FSS-10 so that I would have sufficient rank to be made
                    a vice consul and could do the signing work for Osborn. That was very nice
                    because that meant of course some additional pay and I think there were a few
                    allowances that came along with it. I lived in an occupation hotel. The army
                    assigned us billets in those days in downtown Sapporo. I learned to ski while I
                    was there; that was a new experience too. I really enjoyed the whole year in
                    Hokkaido.</p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned the marriages and all, and coming from
                        California. During the war, there had been a great anti-Japanese prejudice
                        built up, with sufficient reason, after the attack on Pearl Harbor and all,
                        but I think one of the great phenomenons was that American troops, basically
                        American men, came and fell in love with Japanese women. It wasn't just sex;
                        it was the culture and all of that. You might say the prejudice and all
                        didn't last very long at all.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNNINGHAM: There were some other very important things that happened as a result
                    of the occupation. People like David Osborn, who was one of the “Boulder Boys,”
                    Owen Zurhellen, Richard Finn, Ed Seidensticker, Robert Scalapino were
                    others...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're talking about Boulder, Colorado?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNNINGHAM: Yes, Boulder, Colorado. They were guys who were trained in intensive
                    programs in Japanese language by the military services to be interpreters for
                    interrogating Japanese prisoners of war, and also to work on breaking the
                    Japanese codes. These people after the war, and there were others like them...
                    There is a man by the name of Jack Seward, who lives in Houston where I live
                    now...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let me just stop for a second. You were saying there
                        wasomething else?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNNINGHAM: Yes. The people who were trained in Japanese for intelligence
                    purposes during the war, in many cases afterwards became Foreign Service
                    officers. They also became some of our leading scholars on Japan. They were all
                    people who were in the military services, army, navy and so forth, and they
                    became a very important contribution to our society.</p>
                <p>I have had the experience recently of seeing the offspring of some of these
                    unions between Americans and Japanese in the occupation period come back. There
                    is a program now operated by the Japanese government to recruit English tutors
                    to serve in Japanese high schools. In Texas where I have been one of the
                    interviewers for candidates for this program, there have been several who have
                    come through and said, “My mother is Japanese. I was born there. I want to go
                    and see what my mother's country is like.” In some instances the mother never
                    spoke about the country at all. In some instances the mother retained a strong
                    attraction to the country or association with the country, and the children knew
                    their cousins and their grandparents there. This is another element in American
                    society that provides a link to Japan that is coming about as a result of this
                    occupation experience.</p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>Something else that is happening too is that the World War II generation of Japan
                    experts, people of my age, are all passing from the scene now. They are really
                    out of the active business of fostering and nourishing the American-Japanese
                    relationship. The program the Japanese government has instituted to bring young
                    Americans to Japan as English language tutors has been going on now for about 11
                    or 12 years, and eventually is going to replace that generation. One of my
                    students went on that program to Japan, and he has now passed the Foreign
                    Service examination and has qualified in Japanese. He will be in the next A-100
                    class in July of 1998. I see that as part of an on-going continuum that is
                    developing in a very interesting way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By the way while you were in Hokkaido was there any
                        feeling aboua communist movement up there or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNNINGHAM: Not so much about a communist movement though we were very conscious
                    of the Soviet presence in two respects. The island of Sakhalin is just across
                    from the northern tip of Hokkaido, and Wakkanai was a major intelligence
                    listening post for the interception of electronic transmissions from
                    Sakhalin.</p>
                <p>Q: I almost got assigned there. I went to the army language school and took
                    Russian just about the time that you were there. In '51 I was doing that and I
                    was sent to Japan. I sure as hell didn't want to go to Wakkanai.</p>
                <p>CUNNINGHAM: It was a bleak place. The other thing was that the northern
                    territories, the four islands off of the northeast coast of Hokkaido, were a
                    constant issue. We were always hearing about incidents where fishermen were
                    taken captive by the Russian patrol boats up there. I remember Osborn made a
                    couple of trips up there to report on the situation. There was not so much a
                    feeling of a communist movement, as very strong consciousness of a Soviet
                    presence, and in a way a kind of a Soviet menace. By this time, 1951-52, the war
                    in Korea was fully under way, we were deep into the Cold War, and the divisions
                    of Asia were becoming quite fixed at that point.</p>
                <p>I'm trying to recall the governor of Hokkaido at that time, someone whom we knew.
                    I think he may have been a member of the Socialist Party but I'm just not sure
                    of that. I would have to check the record on that because I could be mistaken
                    about that. He was a very personable man and, I suppose, a competent politician.
                    There was a very strong army counterintelligence group there but I think that
                    was directed more towards concern of some kind of Soviet attempt at penetration
                    rather than concern about a subversive movement in northern Japan.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left Sapporo when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNNINGHAM: May 5th or 10th, or something like that.</p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNNINGHAM: Of course I went on home leave first. I had a dilemma at this point.
                    Before leaving Paris in November of 1950 I had taken the Foreign Service
                    examination at the urging of someone in the embassy; I think it was Mary Vance
                    Trent but I'm not sure. Someone along the line encouraged me to do this. I had
                    not known when I entered the Foreign Service that there were Foreign Service
                    officers and Foreign Service staff so I came into the staff corps but then I
                    found out differently and I knew that I wanted to be a Foreign Service
                    officer.</p>
                <p>I took the examination just on a flier and with no expectation that I would pass
                    it. It was a three and a half day examination. My French was not good enough for
                    me to pass the language portion of the examination. As you know, in those days
                    there were only five languages that were considered world languages and you had
                    to pass in one of them. I left Paris immediately after taking the examination
                    and I was in Japan when I learned that I had passed all but the language portion
                    of the exam. Here I was on the other side of the world and I think I had a year
                    to qualify in one of the “world” languages.</p>
                <p>One of the other things that I did while I was in Tokyo was to hunt around for a
                    French tutor. I found a Hungarian woman, Madame Damin, who knew French and was
                    giving French lessons. She was my French tutor and I studied with her for a
                    while. When I got to Hokkaido there weren't any French speakers around. I think
                    there was a French commercial/consular agent up there but I didn't get to know
                    him very well. I should have applied myself more diligently but I did not.</p>
                <p>The upshot of all of this was that by 1952 the eligibility on the written
                    examination had expired. I had to go to square one and start all over again
                    because I didn't have enough French to meet the language requirement. I didn't
                    have enough Spanish either though I had studied Spanish at the University of New
                    Mexico. My French by this time was better than my Spanish so I decided that I
                    had better emphasize that. When I got to Washington in the summer of 1952 and
                    went into Foreign Service personnel in the Department, I said, “I want to pass
                    the Foreign Service examination but I need a language to do it. French is the
                    one I am working on and I don't want to leave Asia.” They said, “Great, we will
                    send you to Saigon.” So I went to Saigon in September of 1952.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How long were you there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNNINGHAM: I was assigned there until November of 1954.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How long were you actually there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNNINGHAM: I was there all that tim26 months. The reason I say assigned there
                    was because from July of 1954 to November of 1954 I was working half time in
                    each of two posts - - in Phnom Penh and in Saigon. Again I was in an
                    administrative capacity. When I arrived in Saigon I was assigned as a general
                    services assistant so I was taking care of property, effects, shipping, all
                    kinds of stuff like that, the usual general services work. It was a very large
                    establishment that we had there. We had something like 20 or 25 residences and a
                    couple of apartment buildings.</p>
                <p>In the spring of 1954 the final military defeat of the French occurred at Dien
                    Bien Phu and the five powers - Russia, the U.S., Britain, France and China -
                    were convening in Geneva again to try to sort out the Asian situation in the
                    wake of the Korean War which had concluded the previous summer in 1953 with the
                    armistice agreement. They reached an agreement on Indochina. The deal was that
                    the French would get out and that the three Indochina states would become fully
                    independent sovereign countries. Up to that time they had been known as the
                    Associated States of the French Commonwealth, or something like that.</p>
                <p>The American ambassador in Saigon, Donald Heath, was accredited also to the
                    governments of Laos and Cambodia. With the entry into force of the Geneva
                    accords on the first of July 1954, U.S. diplomatic representation in Vientiane
                    and Phnom Penh was to be raised to full diplomatic status and we were to have a
                    resident ambassador in each of those posts rather than a charg� d'affaires.</p>
                <p>The embassy in Cambodia on the first of July or the 30th of June, 1954 consisted
                    of a charg� d'affaires, Joseph Montllor, a code clerk, another guy who was
                    ostensibly an embassy staffer but was actually the CIA station chief though a
                    very junior one, an AID representative, and a USIS officer. There were five
                    Americans in the American country team in Cambodia at that time. All of this was
                    going to change and a full embassy was going to be instituted there.</p>
                <p>Robert McClintock, who was deputy chief of mission in Saigon at this time, was
                    designated to be the first resident American ambassador in Phnom Penh. He had
                    become aware of my work in the general services section of the American embassy
                    and he said, “I know whom I want as my administrative officer. I want Bill
                    Cunningham,” who was at this time an FSS-11. I think I had lost the temporary
                    ten and had fallen back to an 11. He asked me if I would like to do it and I
                    said, “Sure.” I felt confident that I could do it.</p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>Off I went at the beginning of July to Phnom Penh. We used to have the CIA
                    airline, Civil Air Transport or CAT, as it was known, which operated throughout
                    Asia and it had a regular flight twice a week up to Phnom Penh. What I used to
                    do was catch a plane Monday morning and fly up to Phnom Penh, work there until
                    Thursday at noon, and catch the afternoon flight back to Saigon. Because I had
                    no replacement in Saigon and they couldn't release me, I would work my job in
                    Saigon Thursday evening, Friday, Saturday, and a good part of Sunday, then I
                    would take off again on Monday morning to Phnom Penh to help them with their
                    administrative work there. That was a real adventure.</p>
                <p>The American embassy up until the first of July 1954 had been located on the
                    second floor of a little downtown building in Phnom Penh not far from the banks
                    of the Tonle Sap, which flows into the Mekong a few miles farther south. The
                    office was over the top of a pepper shop that was owned by a French colonial
                    woman, and the building faced the broad, tree-lined mall, which ran from the
                    front of the railway station a kilometer away right down to the Tonle Sap. . She
                    had been there for a long time and her husband started a pepper plantation. He
                    died and she was a widow and she was selling pepper. She was a rather difficult
                    person. There was no way that we could expand there and we had to find someplace
                    else to put the embassy.</p>
                <p>There was a building under construction elsewhere in Phnom Penh being erected by
                    a Sino-Cambodian businessman. Montllor had thought of that building and said
                    that would make a great building for our American diplomatic establishment that
                    was going to be set up there. “But,” he said, “it is only a two story building.
                    If we could get him to add two floors to the building it will work and we will
                    have enough space.” I got a hold of the architect who was a Frenchman. He had
                    designed the building and I talked with him. He said, “Yes, this foundation is
                    strong enough and we can put two more floors on top of the building.”</p>
                <p>We then got in the midst of a very complicated deal to figure out how we were
                    going to get these two floors added to this building and get it done in time to
                    be able to accommodate the growing staff. People were already beginning to come
                    up from Saigon and elsewhere to report in. We had to find some kind of office
                    space for them because this space over the top of the pepper shop was not going
                    to be adequate.</p>
                <p>There was a lot of AID counterpart money around at that point. I can't remember
                    all the particulars now but I became deeply involved with negotiations with the
                    Sino-Cambodian businessman, the architect, and the AID comptroller to figure out
                    some way whereby we could front money for the construction of the building and
                    then credit that against the eventual lease payments that we would make to this
                    businessman. We worked out a deal, and work began on the building with a total
                    of four floors, configured to requirements of the Embassy. I managed to get this
                    worked out about September or October.</p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>Meantime, the U.S. official establishment was growing and I had to find temporary
                    office space, so I started looking around town. Somebody said there was an
                    abandoned Masonic lodge in the other part of town that would make pretty good
                    temporary quarters for us. I went and looked it over, and negotiated a lease on
                    that.</p>
                <p>Now this Masonic lodge was a very substantial large two-story building and it was
                    built in the colonial style, which is to say with 15 foot ceilings and very
                    large windows that were closed by shutters. There were no glass windows in it,
                    and there was no way of cutting off the outside air. You couldn't air condition
                    the building without installing glass windows. That would be too expensive of a
                    job to do, particularly since it was temporary space. What I had to do was get
                    ceiling fans installed in the building and somehow or other make it comfortable.
                    McClintock was very good about this.</p>
                <p>The fortunate thing was that we moved in there in I think September of 1954 and
                    about that time of the year the humidity begins to decline in Cambodia, and the
                    weather becomes cooler. It becomes bearable, if you have a ceiling fan and dress
                    informally. I had spent enough time up in Cambodia seeing friends over the
                    previous two years that I knew that would work. My gambit was to get everybody
                    into the old Masonic lodge over the cool months and get the four-story embassy
                    building completed before the monsoon hit in April. In late March, early April,
                    it really starts to heat up. By the middle of April you are just praying for the
                    first rain in Cambodia to cool things off.</p>
                <p>That year I worked harder than I think I have ever worked almost any other time
                    in my life. I was working two jobs up until November. Finally a replacement for
                    me in Saigon arrived in November and I was then able to move full time up to
                    Cambodia and act as the administrative officer there.</p>
                <p>Q: I would like to go back to your arrival now and then we will pick up Cambodia
                    again. I would like to go back to September of '52 when you arrived. Who was
                    ambassador? Can you sort of describe the atmosphere in Saigon at that time?</p>
                <p>CUNNINGHAM: Donald Heath was ambassador to the three Associated States of
                    Indochina - - Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos, resident in Saigon at that time. This
                    war had been going on by then almost six years since the collapse of the
                    negotiations between the French and Ho Chi Minh. The French were not making it;
                    it was quite obvious.</p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>It was not safe to travel in the countryside. In fact shortly before I arrived in
                    Saigon two American women on the staff of the Embassy had been shot on the golf
                    course, which was just on the outskirts of Saigon, by the guerillas. Whenever
                    you went into a movie theater in Saigon in those days you were shaken down
                    because it used to be a habit of the Viet Minh to go into the movies, carry a
                    bomb in, and roll it down under the seats so that it would go off in the front
                    of the movie theater. That had happened a few times. On rue Catinat (later Tu
                    Do), here was a little hill that went down towards the Saigon River with
                    open-air French style cafes on both sides. Viet Minh sympathizers or agents
                    would sometimes ride by in cyclopousses and throw a bomb into the cafes as they
                    went through. There were no incidents of this kind as I recall during the time
                    that I was in Saigon but there had been earlier on and there were precautions of
                    various kinds.</p>
                <p>You could not travel outside of the city safely. You could go up to Dalat, which
                    was the hill station, but you had to go by military convoy and they only went
                    twice a week. I made that trip a couple of times. Sometimes it was safe to
                    travel to Cap St. Jacques, now called Vung Tau, which was the beach resort down
                    at the mouth of the Saigon River. In general the government... (end of tape)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were saying there were times you could travel?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNNINGHAM: Yes, we could travel safely to other parts of South Vietnam at times,
                    and other times you could not. I would say about half the time I was there, it
                    was not safe to travel outside of the city of Saigon except in military convoy
                    and even in some cases military convoys were not safe and were brought under
                    attack.The French were very suspicious of our involvement in Vietnam. They felt
                    we were trying to take over their colony for them, or in some way evict them
                    from Vietnam. We were trying to assure them that we were not interested in
                    displacing them, but we felt it was necessary to give the South Vietnamese more
                    independence, more latitude, in order to be more willing to support the war
                    against the Viet Minh. That was generally the atmosphere as I recall it at that
                    time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before the Geneva accords in '54, what was the situation?
                        In '5was all of Vietnam a French colony or did we have a real embassy
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>CUNNINGHAM: We had a real embassy in Saigon, yes, and a consul general in Hanoi.
                    That embassy had been established in about 1950 at which time the French had
                    changed the relationship of Vietnam to France to something like a commonwealth
                    country. Bao Dai was on the throne still as the “emperor” of Vietnam, but there
                    was a French governor general and the French had very strong influence over the
                    governing of Vietnam. There was a civil Vietnamese Government, with a President,
                    Vice President and legislature. Vietnam, however, was not a truly independent
                    country and my impression was it was not even as independent as Canada was at
                    the time. For example, the Vietnamese piaster was linked to the French franc and
                    the French set the exchange rate for the piaster. The Vietnamese did not have
                    independent control of the value of their own currency. There was the same kind
                    of thing as the British practice, commonwealth preference, so far as the
                    importation and exportation of goods from Vietnam was concerned. It was part of
                    the Franc bloc and it was a possession of the French.</p>
                <p>There were about 250,000 troops engaged in the military effort against the Viet
                    Minh at the time. It was a combination of French troops, French colonials from
                    Senegal, Algeria, and other places in the French empire, and Vietnamese troops.
                    There was not an independent Vietnamese army. The army of Vietnam was
                    established about 1953 when de Lattre de Tassigny came out and established the
                    first battalion of an independent army of the Republic of Vietnam. Prior to that
                    time all of the Vietnamese troops were simply troops in the French armed forces
                    fighting against the Viet Minh. It was not a fully sovereign country. It had
                    limited self-rule within the French Commonwealth.</p>
                <p>Cambodia was a little bit more independent. It was a protectorate of France and
                    the French were responsible for defense and foreign relations, and the
                    Cambodians were responsible for internal administration but always under the
                    direction of a French prefect. The same was pretty much true of Laos, also.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the attitude of the staff of the American embassy
                        iSaigon towards the French at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNNINGHAM: I'm trying to think back now to this. We were really walking a bit of
                    a tightrope there. On the one hand we were trying to maintain a cordial
                    relationship with the French and persuade them that it was our intention to
                    support their defense of Vietnam against communist aggression. At the same time
                    I think we were growing more and more aware of the importance of nationalism as
                    an element in the political situation in Vietnam, and we were trying to
                    cultivate some good will I suppose with the Vietnamese. That's about as closely
                    as I can characterize it at the time.</p>
                <p>Q: I was just wondering whether it was one of these things where we were sort of
                    thinking of the French as not really doing things very well and we could do it
                    better and all of that?</p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>CUNNINGHAM: Well there was a certain amount of that, certainly, so far as the
                    prosecution of the war was concerned, and a lot of criticism of the French
                    conduct of the military campaign, particularly that they were conducting it as a
                    colonial war rather than as a war for the sovereign integrity of Vietnam as a
                    sovereign country entitled to self-rule. We thought they ought to give the
                    Vietnamese a little more latitude.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the events leading up to and including the end
                        of that at Dien Bien Phu, which really started at the beginning of 1954?
                        What was our reaction to that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNNINGHAM: As I recall, the Americans were just as much taken by surprise by the
                    way Dien Bien Phu turned out as the French were. I don't recall that there was
                    that much skepticism on the part of the Americans, particularly the military
                    advisors there. I could be mistaken on this but I don't recall that the
                    Americans were advising the French not to concentrate their forces in Dien Bien
                    Phu. It was quite evident by the time that the French elected this strategy,
                    that the French war against the Viet Minh was not succeeding and that the Viet
                    Minh were gradually gaining, and gaining, and gaining. Something had to be done.
                    The French elected to concentrate a very large force at Dien Bien Phu. I don't
                    think that the Americans advised them against it, that is not my impression.</p>
                <p>Of course for a time the French concentrated forces up there and everything
                    seemed to be going well. At first they were not being brought under attack. What
                    no one expected was that the Viet Minh would be able to lug, and actually would
                    lug, artillery over the mountainous terrain and set it up on the perimeter
                    around the valley. I do recall at the time somebody sayinI think it was one of
                    the military groups therthat the French didn't think they needed to take the
                    high ground. Of course now they were being finished off like fish in a
                    barrel.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about social life there? Were the Vietnamese included
                        ithe social life or was it pretty much with the French?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNNINGHAM: A lot of it was with the French and what social life there was
                    involving the Vietnamese I think was to some extent... There were some people in
                    the embassy now who worked very hard at cultivating the Vietnamese. What you
                    have to understand is we had no Vietnamese language officers in the embassy at
                    that time. All conversation with the Vietnamese was conducted in French.
                    Therefore you had contact only with Vietnamese who spoke English or French. If
                    you had contact with a Vietnamese who spoke neither English nor French, it was
                    via an interpreter and it was English to French to Vietnamese most typically.
                    There were very few people who could interpret between English and Vietnamese. A
                    few of my Vietnamese staff in the embassy, for example, spoke English but there
                    were only two whom I relied upon to serve as interpreters to Vietnamese
                    contractors, vendors, and so forth, who I dealt with in the general services
                    office.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any concern about penetration of our embassy by
                        thViet Minh?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNNINGHAM: Not that I recall, no. We did not feel particularly vulnerable in
                    that respect. The French were the ones who were the objects of antagonism for
                    the Vietnamese and I don't recall that we necessarily felt vulnerable to the
                    Viet Minh.</p>
                <p>Q: Was there any concern as Dien Bien Phu was really going through its last agony
                    that we might intervene? I know the French were trying to get us to intervene
                    and it was being considered back in Washington. I was wondering what the
                    attitude was in Vietnam?</p>
                <p>CUNNINGHAM: I think the attitude in Saigon at that point was that it was
                    hopeless. Dien Bien Phu was gone. It was over with. It was finished. You see one
                    thing that happened was, during the period of Dien Bien Phu I remember very
                    clearly one morning while the final battles were going on over there we were all
                    awaken by a huge explosion about 4:00 in the morning. The Viet Minh sappers had
                    gotten through the perimeter and blown up the P.O.L. dump, which was out in one
                    part of town. Then about a half-hour to 45 minutes later there was another huge
                    explosion. This one was closer in, and it was the French army's ammo dump.</p>
                <p>So here at a time when the French army was fighting for its life in Dien Bien Phu
                    the sappers had blown up the P.O.L. supply and blown up the ammo dump in Saigon.
                    That convinced everybody in the establishment, I think, that it was over with.
                    If the French could not protect their main stronghold in South Vietnam at a time
                    when their army was under attack and fighting for its life in the north, they
                    were not going to be able to hold onto Vietnam; that was the end of it. Of
                    course the negotiations at this time were beginning to pick up in Geneva, so the
                    handwriting on the wall was very clear. Everybody knew that it was over at that
                    point.</p>
                <p>Those two explosions by the way broke windows in the ambassador's residence and I
                    had to get busy the next morning. As a matter of fact what made McClintock pick
                    me out a few weeks later to be his Administrative Officer in Phnom Penh was that
                    I got the windows in his residence fixed very quickly. That's how I got my job
                    in Cambodia. It was truly an extraordinary opportunity. I was an FSS-11 or maybe
                    an FSS-10 at the time. I had a minor supervisory position. I had no training in
                    fiscal or personnel management, which are major responsibilities of an
                    administrative officer. I did like managing things and getting difficult jobs
                    done. And I was still single, mobile, young, and adventurous.</p>

                </p>

                <p>
                    <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Coming back to Phnom Penh...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNNINGHAM: There are a couple of more things that I would like to say about
                    Saigon before we leave it, and again it is sort of a personal reflection on it.
                    Once the Geneva accords were agreed to, 90 days was allowed for people to
                    evacuate from the north to the south, and of course the French also were given
                    90 days to get their troops out.There were three things that I remember very
                    clearly about this period. One was the speed with which the French pulled out.
                    They pulled out so fast that we actually began to protest that they were leaving
                    too quickly and they were going to cause the collapse of Vietnam particularly by
                    departing so quickly. I think all the French troops were out within 60 days
                    rather than 90. They were not interested in staying any longer at all.</p>
                <p>The second thing is the arrival of Ngo Dinh Diem. I remember very clearly the day
                    that he arrived; it was in early July of 1954. It was the first time in my life
                    that I saw spontaneous demonstrations in the streets of Saigon or almost
                    anywhere. There weren't a lot of people that came out but people did come out
                    and I remember that there was sort of a spontaneity and optimism about his
                    arrival and the welcome that he was given at that time.</p>
                <p>The third thing that I remember is the evacuation of refugees from North Vietnam.
                    There was a huge stream of them. There was an airlift almost constantly from
                    North Vietnam into Ton Son Nhut airport. I was out at the airport frequently on
                    other business and every time I went out there, there were transport planes of
                    all descriptions, one after another, landing and discharging North Vietnamese
                    refugees. This was a major airlift, with planes of all descriptions landing one
                    after the other. Again I remember these people coming off of those planes and
                    having a dazed look about them. These were people who had been uprooted from
                    their ancestral villages where their families had lived for generations and they
                    were brought into a strange land. Their dress was different. Their language was
                    different. They didn't know where they were. It was really a very moving and
                    pathetic sight.</p>
                <p>Not only that, I remember very well the transport ships. American military
                    transports were finally pressed into service to help evacuate North Vietnamese
                    from North Vietnam to South Vietnam within the 90-day period, and they were
                    jammed. Those ships were pulling up in the Saigon River right across the street
                    from the Majestic Hotel at the foot of Rue Catinat, or Tu Do as it was later
                    called, and there were people all over the decks; they were burdened with
                    people. A lot of them were people who were not allowed to leave their villages
                    and go to the evacuation ports. They had actually launched themselves into the
                    sea on whatever kind of craft, or even just a floating piece of wood that they
                    could get, to get out into the shipping lanes and be picked up by ships that
                    were coming south.</p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>There were several hundred thousands who evacuated in that period to South
                    Vietnam. That left a very deep impression on me. Within five years I had seen
                    people fleeing tyranny in three different countries, in two different parts of
                    the world, and those are indelible memories that I just can't forget. I think
                    they have to be part of the record nowadays. Those of us who remember have to
                    let others know what the experiences were like. Anyway, that's pretty much it
                    for Saigon.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in Cambodia from 1954 until when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNNINGHAM: I think I left on the 14th of July 1955.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was Cambodia like?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNNINGHAM: We used to call it the poor man's Bangkok. I liked Cambodia very much
                    in those days. It was a very peaceful country, peaceful people. There was a
                    certain amount of guerilla activity going on up in the northwest but for the
                    most part the rest of the country was very peaceful. It was very poor. Cambodian
                    people are very generous and kind people, likeable people. They were then trying
                    to recapture their sense of identity after about 70 years as a French
                    protectorate. An International Control Commission was set up to monitor the
                    truce in Cambodia. It was composed of military personnel from Canada, India, and
                    Poland. The commanders of each national detachment lived in the Hotel Royale,
                    the principal hotel in the city and the social center for the international and
                    French colonial community there. Dinner hour in the Hotel Royale dining room
                    suddenly became very cosmopolitan, with the staff of each of the three
                    contingents seated at separate tables. Each had a retinue of diplomatic
                    officers. Everyone was busy watching everyone else and warily making
                    contact.</p>
                <p>Of course Phnom Penh at that point changed from the very sleepy little capital of
                    a minor kingdom into a rather, not really cosmopolitan place, but there was sort
                    of a bustle of diplomatic activity. A lot of the French who had done business in
                    Saigon moved up to Phnom Penh and transferred their offices up there, so that
                    brought a lot of people in. It brought some money in and shot up the price of
                    housing. Of course the Americans contributed to that, too.</p>
                <p>As I say there were five official Americans in Phnom Penh on the first of July
                    1954. By the time I left one year later there were 90. We had a full-fledged
                    embassy, USIS, AID mission, and a military advisory group there. I had to find
                    office space, housing, and English speaking local Cambodian employees for
                    practically all of them. That was a real adventure.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did Robert McClintock run his embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>CUNNINGHAM: Robert McClintock was a groupie. He liked to have people around him.
                    He also had a certain dash and flair. He made a habit of dictating all of his
                    telegrams in final form. He was very insistent upon having a secretary that
                    could take good dictation and he would never redraft a telegram. He would have a
                    diplomatic conversation someplace, and he would come back to the office and call
                    his secretary in. He wouldn't have made any notes, and he would dictate a cable
                    report to the Department on the spot and sign what he had dictated. He made that
                    known; he was very proud of that and that's the way he wanted his drafting
                    officers to work. He was a pretty decisive guy.He was approachable. He was not a
                    high posture man although he was a strong, decisive leader. I always felt that I
                    could go into him and say, “Mr. Ambassador this is a problem and this is what I
                    think we ought to do.” He's say, “Okay, if you think so, you do it. Of course
                    you realize that you are responsible for making sure it's the right
                    recommendation and that it works out if you do that.” He was not bureaucratic.
                    He was decisive and quick. He had a quick temper, but that was balanced by a
                    good sense of humor. I was never aware that he carried even the slightest grudge
                    against anyone. In general he was well liked by his staff. In the year that I
                    was there I didn't hear any carping or criticism of him as you often hear of
                    senior ambassadors in other places. He also watched out for the staff. It was
                    his first ambassadorship.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CUNNINGHAM: No, I think he had Seamus, a big Irish setter, with him at that time.
                    He liked to talk about his experiences in Lebanon. I guess Lebanon came after
                    that.</p>

                <p>CUNNINGHAM: His wife was Chilean. He had a good sense of humor. He liked to tell
                    a joke. He enjoyed a good glass of champagne. He had the habit also of ending
                    his telegrams with some kind of a fillip. For example, the only example that I
                    can recall, but it is typical, is one in which he said he had gone to see the
                    French resident general, or whatever the top French official was at this time
                    with Cambodia being a fully independent country, and he talked with him about
                    this and so forth. In typical fashion, McClintock came back to the Embassy
                    promptly and dictated his reporting telegram. The closing line of the telegram
                    was, “and by the time we concluded our conversation the champagne was warm.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the attitude that you gathered from the rest of
                        thembassy towards Sihanouk?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>CUNNINGHAM: They were suspicious of him. They found him temperamental, which he
                    certainly was, and difficult to get along with. They were bothered by the
                    influence of the queen mother, who was playing some kind of a political role at
                    this time, had over Sihanouk. Of course you have to understand that I was not a
                    political officer at this point. I was a politically interested administrative
                    officer and an aspiring Foreign Service officer, but I had no responsibility for
                    political analysis. My impressions of things up to this point are of that
                    category. I didn't have access to the diplomatic traffic that was going on, and
                    so on. I did have instincts and feelings about politics in general and in
                    respect to Asia in particular. These instincts had been formed by years of
                    personal interest, reading, and university education, as a summer reporter and
                    as a witness to political life in New Mexico. I was impressed by Sihanouk, and I
                    still am. He is an extremely clever man.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think he is still going.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNNINGHAM: He is a political survivor. He is still going and everybody else is
                    gone. Sihanouk's goal was to gain full independence for his country. That should
                    have been what we wanted also because it was the best guarantee against
                    communist subversion, but he wanted to do it his way, and we wanted him to do it
                    a different way. That's the best that I can characterize what I understood and
                    gathered of the relationship with him at the time. We were frequently at
                    loggerheads with Sihanouk or with his agents. As a result of that, we did not
                    have good access to the Cambodian political establishment, whatever it was.</p>
                <p>The best example of this is when John Foster Dulles made his swing through
                    Southeast Asia in the spring of 1955 to set up the SEATO organization. The
                    treaty was concluded at a conference in Manila. Dulles visited Saigon,
                    Vientiane, and Phnom Penh en route to Manila. Phnom Penh was the last stop
                    before he went on to Manila. He went to the palace and had lunch with the king
                    at that time, and I know very well because I had to host his secretary and a
                    couple other members of the party to lunch at my house and that was very
                    enjoyable. Off he flew, either that afternoon or the next morning, to Manila.
                    Ambassador McClintock went with him to attend this conference in Manila.</p>
                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>A day or two later at noontime during the siesta periothere used to be siestas
                    when everything was shut down in Indochina in those days from noon to
                    threSihanouk broadcast his message of abdication. The embassy was absolutely
                    dumbstruck by this. Not only did we not know it was coming, we found out about
                    it because one of the Embassy's Cambodian chauffeurs happened to be listening to
                    the radio that afternoon. He did not speak very good English and he did not
                    speak French at all, so there was a great deal of hustling around the embassy
                    that afternoon to try to find out exactly what it was the Sihanouk had said on
                    the radio about leaving office and what the implications were. The poor
                    chauffeur was being interrogated right and left through intermediaries who were
                    trying to establish this communication. Eventually somebody got over to the
                    foreign Ministry or wherever, and got an official statement. A frantic telegram
                    went off to Manila report to the secretary of State, who had just seen the king
                    two days previously, that he had abdicated.</p>
                <p>No one knew what this abdication meant. I said, “Well it is obvious. He can't
                    play a political role if he is on the throne, and he wants to play a political
                    role. He is not out of politics by any means.” I don't think that was the
                    interpretation that the initial reports from the embassy put on it at the time.
                    I could be mistaken but my impression is that there was some other exotic
                    rationale or reasoning that went into it. It seemed to me to be pretty obvious
                    what Sihanouk was trying to do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He became known as Prince Sihanouk which I guess he still
                        is kinof known as.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNNINGHAM: Now he is king again. The situation has now changed enough that he
                    can play a role and grant amnesty to various people, which he has done. I always
                    felt that many of our problems in Cambodia came about because we couldn't get on
                    the good side of Sihanouk and I think it all originated from that early period
                    in 1954 when we couldn't persuade him to do things our way.</p>
                <p>Q: Yes, and then later he got very annoyed about too much of a CIA presence. I
                    mean we came into all sorts of things and he just didn't trust us, and with
                    reason.</p>
                <p>CUNNINGHAM: Sihanouk is a real activist. He is somebody like Lyndon Johnson in a
                    manner of speaking. He was going to be his own man. He was going to run things.
                    He was in charge of his country and he felt competent to do so. He wanted to
                    have command and he didn't want a bunch of other people telling him how to do
                    it. He wanted their cooperation and their help. Anyway, so be it. There it
                    is.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left there in July 1955?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>CUNNINGHAM: Yes. There are two other things that I ought to tell you about so far
                    as setting this embassy up is concerned. One is that I did manage to get that
                    building completed in the middle of April and to get everybody in. The week
                    after we moved in the real heat wave arrived. I made my deadline to get people
                    under air conditioning by the time the monsoons began, and I count that as a
                    great success. It was a real job to do it.</p>
                <p>The last problem was with the electrical company, which was still run by a French
                    company at that time. I believe it was private, but very likely had a
                    preferential status under the old, and by then defunct, colonial system. As I
                    recall the situation, the electrical companies, by then at least, in each of the
                    three former states of the Indochina union (now four with North Vietnam) was
                    independent of the others, but all were owned by a holding company based in
                    France.</p>
                <p>At the embassy, we wanted to have a backup generator in the embassy for emergency
                    power. It had to be connected in a particular way to the municipal grid, still
                    operated by the French company, so that the generator would kick on
                    automatically as soon as the electricity from municipal grid was interrupted.
                    The local manager, a very rigid colonial type, was not willing to allow us to
                    install the automatic device between the municipal grid and the backup
                    generator. We had the emergency generator in place. We had all the wiring in
                    place, all the switching, all the circuitry. Everything was there except the
                    link to the power grid of the French electrical company. The local manager would
                    not give us permission to make that connection, and we couldn't make the
                    electrical system operational until he did. It was April. I knew the hot season
                    was almost upon us. The old Masonic Temple would become unbearably hot any day.
                    The new Chancery Building was in every other respect ready for us to move in.
                    But I could not move anyone until I could assure reliable emergency power. Were
                    I to do so, it would represent a capitulation to the manager of the power
                    company whom I had all along been telling that the connection was absolutely
                    essentiaa non-negotiable requirement.</p>
                <p>I made all kinds of demarches to the manager. He was unyielding. Meantime, the
                    weather was getting warmer, and back at the temporary chancery in the Masonic
                    Lodge, the Embassy staff was getting uncomfortable and restive. I had put myself
                    between the rock and the hard place.</p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>Finally I got word that the general manager from Paris was going to be in town so
                    I requested an appointment with him and I went to see him. I went to see him and
                    it was interesting. He spoke excellent English. (The local manager did not.) I
                    explained the problem to him and he turned to the manager and asked him in
                    French “what's going on here?” The local manager went into his routine about the
                    incompatibility of our installation and the municipal grid and the technical
                    impossibility of allowing the connection we requested. The general manager said,
                    “That's nonsense.” He then turned to me and said, “Mr. Cunningham, that will be
                    taken care of. Go back and tell the ambassador it is all set. We are very
                    grateful for what you Americans have been doing in this part of the world and we
                    will always support you here. There is no technical problem; no reason why this
                    shouldn't be done.” I immediately went back to Ambassador McClintock and said,
                    “You've got to send this guy a thank you note.” He came through for us. That was
                    a very good event for me.</p>
                <p>The other major problem was getting English speaking Cambodian employees. There
                    weren't any Cambodians in Phnom Penh who spoke English at that time. They had
                    been under French occupation and acculturation for 70 years, and many spoke
                    excellent French. We had to have English speaking local employees. Finally
                    somebody said to me, “You know, during the war the two western provinces of
                    Cambodia were ceded to the Thai and the Thai occupied them. When the war ended
                    these provinces were returned to Cambodia. A lot of the Cambodians who were
                    living there moved to Bangkok. English is the lingua franca of Thailand. There
                    is a community of Cambodians living in Bangkok, and maybe now that the French
                    are out some of them would be willing to come back.” I don't know who it was
                    that told me this; it may have been the CIA guy in Phnom Penh. He said, “Maybe
                    you could recruit some of them. You go to Bangkok and see Jim Thompson who knows
                    these people.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was the silk guy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNNINGHAM: The old Jim Thompson from the Original Thai Silk Company. The
                    legendary OSS operative who later disappeared mysteriously in Malaysia at
                    Cameron Highlands. I got orders, went to Bangkok, and looked up Thompson at his
                    Thai Silk shop one afternoon. I explained the situation to him and he said,
                    “Okay, I'll help you. Come to my house tomorrow afternoon, at such and such a
                    time”, and he gave me the address. I went and I saw Jim Thompson's beautiful
                    house in Bangkok, on a klong, filled with all kinds of magnificent oriental
                    furniture and art. It was a virtual museum, and I've not seen the likes of it
                    since. Thompson had there a leader of the Cambodian community in Bangkok who
                    spoke very good English. I brought someone from the American embassy in Bangkok
                    with me because if this were worked out we would have to have some kind of
                    processing to go through this hiring arrangement. I explained the situation to
                    the man Thompson had invited to meet me, and I had a long conversation with him.
                    He said, “All right. I'll find people for you.” I told him that this
                    representative of the embassy in Bangkok was the person whom should be
                    contacted; I've forgotten now who that officer was.</p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>I went away and within a month somewhere on the order of ten to 12 English
                    speaking Cambodian employees who were recruited in Bangkok had moved to Phnom
                    Penh to join the staff of our embassy. It was very rough for them reintegrating
                    into the community. Some of them were Sino-Cambodians I believe and it was a big
                    change of lifestyle, living standards, and all the rest, but that worked out.
                    Many times since everything collapsed in 1975 and Pol Pot came to power, I have
                    wondered how many, some 20 years later, still were there and what suffering they
                    might have endured. They did come to Cambodia of their own free will, but I was
                    the agent of their decision.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: '74 wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNNINGHAM: Yes, '74. There was a period of course in between when we had no
                    relations with Cambodia at all. I wonder how life turned out for those people,
                    but anyhow you can't foresee all of these things. They took a chance. I just
                    hope that they were dealt with fairly by the American government and taken care
                    of because they did make a sacrifice to be there. I never retained any contact,
                    with them, but my conscience won't let me forget them. They worked for the
                    Embassy loyally, as did the Czech staff we were forced to let go in Prague in
                    1950. All are part of the family to whom our country is indebted, but who are
                    mostly unknown to our people. May God give them all peace and rest.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left there in July '55.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNNINGHAM: I left there in July of '55. By this time my French was pretty good.
                    I had been taking the Foreign Service exam all this time and I was passing the
                    language portion of it, but not the other part because I was too long out of
                    college.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, away from academia.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNNINGHAM: Yes, away from academia and doing other work, and so on. I went back
                    to Washington and I was assigned to the old FE/EX, the executive office of the
                    bureau, the administrative backup.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: For the Far East?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>CUNNINGHAM: Yes, for the old Far East as we called it, the Bureau of Far Eastern
                    Affairs, now the Bureau of East Asian Affairs. I worked there in some
                    administrative capacity backing up the general services people in the area of
                    Southeast Asia of which I had been familiar. We had an office in the old
                    temporary buildings along 23rd Street. I was living somewhere up on Meridian
                    Hill in a rooming house and sort of pondering what my future was going to be. I
                    was getting ready to take the Foreign Service exam again.</p>
                <p>One night November about 11:00 P.M. I was sound asleep and the phone rang. I
                    answered it and it was David Osborn who at that time was serving on the China
                    desk. He said, “Bill?” I said, “Yes?” “How would you like to study Chinese?” I
                    said, “David, I've always wanted to study Chinese. I've wanted to study Chinese
                    for several years.” I'd been putting that in on my preference report as the
                    language I next wanted to learn. I had decided that when I was back in Hokkaido
                    working for David in the early '50s. He said, “That's good because there was a
                    meeting this afternoon to select the next class of Chinese language officers and
                    I put your name in.” That was the second class to be selected after the Foreign
                    Service Institute reinstated its field language school and its own internal
                    Chinese language program. Up until that time they had been sending people to
                    universities to take Chinese language training. One class had gone through in
                    1955, and I was to be in the class of 1956. I said, “That's great.” I hung up
                    and went back to sleep.</p>
                <p>The next morning I woke up and I thought, did I dream something? I called up
                    Osborn and said, “Did you call me last night and tell me I was going to be
                    studying Chinese?” He said, “Yes, I did. Have you changed your mind?” I said,
                    “No, no, no, absolutely not. I definitely want to do it.”</p>
                <p>There is a little aphorism in Chinese about the great Taoist scholar, Zhuang Ci.
                    Zhuang Ci falls asleep and has a dream that he's a butterfly. He is a beautiful
                    butterfly and he flies all about, samples all the flowers, and so forth. It was
                    an extremely realistic dream. Then he wakes up and from then on Zhuang Ci, the
                    teacher, says I do not know whether I am a butterfly dreaming that I am Zhuang
                    Ci or whether I am Zhuang Ci who dreamt that he was a butterfly. That was sort
                    of the way that I feel about this conversation that I had with Osborn that late
                    night.</p>

                <p>CUNNINGHAM: I had not taken the Foreign Service exam. It is a mystery to me how
                    as a staff officer, at that time I was an FSS-9, I was selected for Chinese
                    language training. There were six of us in the class. There were four of us
                    Foreign Service people, Dick Donald, Dick Nethercut, Jim Rousseau, and myself,
                    plus Fred Fisher who was a USIA Foreign Service officer, and Bill Rhoads who I
                    think was a CIA officer. I was Foreign Service staff. I must have taken the
                    Foreign Service examination that fall but I don't think I had the results yet;
                    this becomes important for the following year. In any case I began Chinese
                    language training in January of 1956 as a Foreign Service staff officer, class
                    nine. It was, I reckon, the influence of David Osborn who had become a mentor of
                    mine by that time and whose work I very much admired and respected, that I got
                    into that line of work and got that opportunity. I started studying Chinese and
                    I did sort of all right.</p>
                <p>That December something else very important happened. I attended a Christmas
                    party late in December here in Washington that was given by three young women
                    who were working at VOA at that time. A friend of mine who had been with me in
                    Korea and Cambodia, Donald Riley in USIS, was invited and he said, “Why don't
                    you come along?” I said, “I don't feel like it.” He said, “Oh, come on, you'll
                    enjoy it.” So I went.</p>
                <p>It was up in an apartment house on Connecticut Avenue. There was a very
                    attractive young lady at that party whom I wanted to meet, and I did get to
                    meet. Her name was Patricia Sloan. She was on home leave from Florence where she
                    was the assistant cultural officer. She had been staying with some people who
                    worked at VOA where she had been employed before going overseas with USIS, and
                    who were also invited to this party so she came along with them. We met at that
                    party. I engaged her in conversation and invited her out to dinner afterwards.
                    To make a long story short, we were married the following July, and we still
                    are. She's here with me this week in Washington and we are going to our
                    granddaughter's eighth grade graduation tonight.</p>
                <p>Anyway, I went into Chinese language training in January of 1956 very deeply in
                    love with Patricia Sloan, studying this hard language, distracted by this, and I
                    was up for the oral boards in April of 1956. I had passed both the language and
                    the written portion of the examination by that point and I think by then it had
                    been reduced from a three-day to a one-day operation. I came up for the oral
                    boards in April of that year and they started asking me all kinds of questions
                    about American history, economics, economic analysis and so on. I wasn't
                    prepared and I failed.</p>
                <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                <p>It was the worst experience of my life. Here I was, I had met the girl of my
                    dreams, I was going to get married the following July, and I was in Chinese
                    language training which is something I had always wanted to do. I had been in
                    the Foreign Service seven years. I liked it and I wanted to continue in it and I
                    failed this. I was absolutely crushed. I didn't know what I was going to do. I
                    must say my wife, at that time my fianc�e, could have said to me at that point,
                    “Sorry, where you are is not where I hope to be.” She could have gotten out of
                    it at that point but she was very loyal and she did not desert me. She
                    encouraged me.</p>
                <p>After about a week of hearing me moaning and moping around she said, “You've got
                    to get your act together. You've got to do this thing and do what it takes to
                    get through.” I went to see Max Krebs, the Executive Director of the Board of
                    Examiners at that point, who was I guess on the Board of Examiners. He said to
                    me, “Bill, we've got to have Foreign Service officers who know American history,
                    who understand our economic system. If they are going to represent us abroad
                    they are going to have to know those things, and you didn't do well. Everybody
                    thought it was going to be a very easy interview so we are just as disappointed
                    as you are. It's up to you. You've got to correct it.” I said, “What do I do?”
                    He said, “Night school. Take a course in economics at American University or
                    GW.” I said, “But I'm getting married in July.” He said, “If you want to be a
                    Foreign Service officer, you've got to do it. There are some books you should
                    read, too. Henry Steele Commager.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: American Civilization I think.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNNINGHAM: Yes, right. “So get to work.” I went back to FSI and told Howard
                    Sollenberger what had happened and what I would have to do. I got Commager's
                    book. I found a night course in macroeconomics at American U. We completed our
                    wedding plans. The other five who were in the language course were sent on to
                    Taiwan in June. There would only be six months training and that would be the
                    end of it. Another class was not to begin until the following January. I was
                    kept in FSI and there I think I am grateful to Howard Sollenberger who saw some
                    potential. Howard even arranged for my fianc�e, later my bride, to have some
                    limited Chinese instruction during her lunch hour. She worked in the old Walker
                    Johnson Building on New York Avenue. The FSI in those days was located in the
                    three little apartment buildings at the corner of 21st and C Streets, NW.</p>
                <p>I was doing all right in the language by that time. I was doing all right in the
                    language by that time. As a matter of fact I was one of the best students in the
                    class. Maybe not the best but they liked my work and they saw potential. They
                    saw that I could make it. Sollenberger arranged for me to continue to study
                    one-on-one with a Chinese tutor there in FSI while I got my status worked
                    out.</p>
                <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                <p>At this time also the Wristonization program was going on and somebody said it
                    me, “Apply for Wristonization. You are eligible.” I thought I would really like
                    to be a thorough Foreign Service officer and do it the way everybody else has,
                    but I'll do that to have a holding spot. I put in my application for
                    Wristonization. I got married.</p>
                <p>I came up for the oral board for the Wriston exercise in about September of 1956.
                    By this time I was married, I had competed the summer night course at GW, I
                    continued my Chinese language studies, and I had been reading American history.
                    They put me through an oral examination the likes of which I had never had
                    before or since. It seems to me there was a board of three or four of them, and
                    it was over in the old Walker Johnson Building, a Marine Corps building at one
                    point in its history, on New York Avenue where USIA was headquartered. By the
                    time that interview was over, my head was spinning. I felt like I had been put
                    through the third degree. I think even the lighting effects in the room were
                    almost like that. It went on, and on, and on. It felt like it was three hours
                    that I was in there, and they asked me everything.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you recall some of the questions?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNNINGHAM: They asked me about American history, the economy, and the
                    acquisition of the Florida territory. I guess they asked me about what I had
                    been doing in the Foreign Service, my career experiences in Asia, and all sorts
                    of other things. I guess they were testing my powers of analysis as well as my
                    general knowledge. It was rigorous and by the time I got out of there, I had the
                    worst headache I ever had and I almost didn't care whether I passed or failed
                    because I was so washed out by the experience.</p>
                <p>Then I heard nothing. Weeks went by and I continued to study Chinese. We were
                    settling into our marriage and going through all that adjustment. My wife
                    continued to work at USIA in the exhibits division. We worried about this thing
                    and finally come November, I still hadn't heard anything so I went to see
                    Randolph Kidder who was in some position in the Department at that point. I had
                    known Kidder in Indochina. He had been in Saigon as first political counselor,
                    and then as DCM when McClintock was sent to Cambodia.</p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>Kidder was in some part of this Wristonization process so I said to him, “Here is
                    my situation. This has been dragging on. I don't know what is going to happen. I
                    don't know where my career is going but whichever it is, either in or our, I
                    would just as soon know as soon as possible. If it's out, I have to make other
                    plans. I am resigned to that if necessary.” He said, “Well this is supposed to
                    be a merit process and it is not supposed to be subject to any kind of personal
                    intervention.” I said, “Can you find out what's going on and what the time line
                    is on this thing?” He said, “Well, let me see.” About a week later on a Saturday
                    morning I received a phone call at home. He was calling me from home and he
                    said, “This conversation is not supposed to take place but don't worry about
                    your status; you will be Okay.” And that is all he would tell me, so I said,
                    okay, and I thanked him. That was typical of Kidder. He was considerate of the
                    staff people, the younger ones who were coming up. I don't mean that he was an
                    easy mark, or that he held us to a lesser standard. But he did look out for his
                    people, as any good leader or supervisor should.</p>
                <p>A few weeks later I received transfer orders to go to the language school in
                    Taiwan and join my class. I was still a Foreign Service Staff then; that had not
                    changed. After I arrived in Taiwan in January of 1957 and reported in to
                    language school, official word finally came through that my appointment as a
                    Foreign Service officer had been approved. Then I had to have the oath
                    administered so that my pay status could be changed. Nicholas Bodman, the
                    Director of the Language School, apparently was not authorized to administer the
                    oath. Paul Popple, with whom I had served in Saigon and who had been a good
                    friend there, was the senior officer among the language students, so I asked
                    that he be designated to administer the oath, which he did between classes on a
                    gloomy, chilly January morning in the little front office of the language
                    school. The surroundings were, if anything, less pretentious than those in which
                    Marvin Will had first administered the oath to me in that old temporary building
                    in September 1949. There was no ceremony. I went back to class right afterwards.
                    It was very much in contrast to my first commissioning ceremony in the Navy at
                    Albuquerque ten and a half years previously. After almost seven and a half years
                    and many attempts, I was finally a Foreign Service Officer.</p>
                <p>I also - and this is very important to me - during this interlude I took the
                    Foreign Service written examination one more time. It came along again in
                    December and was administered at Georgetown University. I took the exam because
                    I didn't know how this process was going to turn out. Even if it turned out okay
                    I still wanted to say I passed the Foreign Service examination all the way
                    through. I took the written exaby then only a one-day affaiin December 1956, and
                    I did pass it. By then it was not necessary to have a language qualification to
                    be appointed an FSO, but I had met the qualification in French and was training
                    in Chinese, I had been through a rigorous oral board, and through a written
                    examination, which I passed at least three times. I figured that I had covered
                    all the bases, at least to my satisfaction. I had made the record that I was
                    qualified to be a Foreign Service officer.</p>

                </p>

                </p>
                <p>CUNNINGHAM: I was there from January of 1957 until the end of July 1958. The
                    language training program at that time was somewhat longer than it is now. In
                    those days we took six months initially in the U.S. and two more years at the
                    field school in Taichung.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you tell me a little bit about your impression in
                        how thschool worked then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNNINGHAM: The headmaster was Nicholas Bodman who was a Ph.D. in linguistics
                    from Cornell, as I recall. He was a specialist on languages of south China, but
                    he also knew Mandarin. It was a very good program. Bodman was a very strict
                    scholar. He was not a career Foreign Service officer. FSI hired scholars to run
                    the school in those days. It was pretty rigorous training. I think the school
                    operated well, and operated effectively.</p>
                <p>We used standard texts that were produced by Yale University, and there were more
                    materials that were produced by the faculty there. The teachers were all young
                    Chinese who were university graduates for the most part or were university
                    people in the sense that they had university education though they may not have
                    been able to complete it. They were all from north China because that was the
                    approved standard for the Chinese language, the official language.</p>
                <p>We attended class in groups of three and four for four hours a day, and these
                    were usually in the verbal language. Later on we also had some courses in
                    learning to read Chinese characters; we had been studying that in Washington as
                    well. I guess we all had a command of somewhere on the order of 300-500
                    characters by the time that I got to Taiwan. I was able to catch up with my
                    class relatively quickly. I was a little bit stronger on some points, and a
                    little bit weaker on others. They were there and of course they had more
                    exposure to the spoken language than I had in Washington. I had a little bit
                    more exposure to the written language than they had by that point, but I was not
                    out of sync with them. We had two hours of one-on-one tutorials. We also were
                    expected to do about four hours of homework every evening.</p>
                <p>We were also expected to do some reading on the area, on China. There were
                    certain books that were recommended but there was no standard requirement, which
                    I think, was probably a mistake. There should have been certain core books that
                    we all had to read. We were given a choice among a wide array of books to read.
                    There weren't so many books on China in those days. The literature is vast,
                    enormous now, by comparison.</p>
                <pb facs="0060" n="Page0060"/>
                <p>We had speakers come in. Bodman used to arrange for speakers to come in, people
                    from the embassy to brief us from time to time, or other travelers from
                    Washington who might be coming through, or people from Hong Kong, and sometimes
                    local people would come in. I don't recall that any of those were in Chinese.
                    Occasionally we would have a field trip, about three or four a year, to go out
                    and visit villages or some locality and get exposed a little bit to Chinese life
                    and institutions.</p>
                <p>It was a very enjoyable experience. We were not part of the embassy. We were not
                    a functioning diplomatic post. We were a school and we didn't have
                    responsibilities that took us away from our studies. It was a comfortable and
                    enjoyable life.</p>
                <p>Q: In all of this language training one of the big things is learning from your
                    teachers about the culture and all of that. Were you getting any feel for the
                    Nationalist, the KMT regime in Taiwan, and then what was happening in China
                    itself?</p>
                <p>CUNNINGHAM: Yes. Well so far as the culture is concerned, the language text
                    incorporated a lot of cultural material into it like behavior and how to conduct
                    yourself in dealing with people. We did study political questions when we got
                    more advanced. When we got to the point where we could read Chinese newspapers
                    they became part of our daily text so we picked up a lot of contemporary
                    political information from that, and we had periodic briefings at the
                    embassy.</p>
                <p>First of all it was illegal in Taiwan at that time for anyone to be in possession
                    of anything that was printed or published on the mainland. One of the big
                    questions was how were we going to learn simplified characters and the literary
                    style of mainland publications if we couldn't study them? The school by the time
                    that I arrived there had worked out an arrangement with the local authorities
                    that made it all right for our instructors to use People's Daily in the school
                    as a textual material but it could not leave the premises.</p>
                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>The teachers for the most part were pretty interested in what was published in
                    People's Daily and they weren't necessarily accepting of it. They all had their
                    own bitter experiences at the hands of the communists, but they hadn't always
                    had good experiences at the hands of the Nationalists and they had their
                    reservations and objections. These were intellectuals, well informed people,
                    well educated people, so they had their criticisms of the KMT and its policies
                    particularly in China, but also some of the things that it was doing in Taiwan.
                    That didn't mean that they were pro-Communist, but they credited some of the
                    critiques of the communists with being accurate and on point when it came to the
                    Nationalists.In class you could get them to talk a little bit about this, some
                    more than others, but everybody was very cautious about it. Not only that, there
                    were some among the faculty who were considered to be pro-KMT, though not
                    necessarily agents of the regime. That meant that some faculty would not discuss
                    certain matters in the presence of other faculty and it had to be understood
                    among us that we should not attribute things, certain comments, to certain
                    members of the faculty when talking with other members of the faculty. You had
                    to be somewhat circumspect. This was kind of a constant undertone in the
                    school.</p>
                <p>I remember one time later on when I became the Director of the Language School,
                    Yeh Kung-chao (aka George Yeh), who had been foreign minister and then was the
                    ROC ambassador to Washington, was home on a visit and he came to the school. We
                    were showing him around. Edgar Snow had recently been to Beijing and had
                    interviewed Chou En-lai.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He had been a left wing correspondent in Britain.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNNINGHAM: No, Snow was an American citizen, a native, I believe of Kansas City.
                    He was the author of Red Star Over China and others. He had been a correspondent
                    in China for the Saturday Evening Post in the 1930s and had very close ties to
                    the PRC regime and the Chinese communists, dating from the days that he had
                    known them as revolutionaries. He was a well-known authority on conditions in
                    China at that time but with a particular point of view. In any case, he was
                    considered a leftist in American circles as well as in international
                    circles.</p>
                <p>Anyway, Snow, on one of his visits to mainland China, had a long interview with
                    Chou En-lai, which had been published in Life magazine. One of our jobs at the
                    Language School was to train interpreters for the Warsaw talks, which were going
                    on at that time. This is a later period in 1961 to 1962 but it is germane to the
                    point we were discussing. At that point I was Director of the language school so
                    I instructed the two teachers, who were preparing our interpreters, to take this
                    article and to translate it into Chinese in order to get the flavor of how the
                    PRC would discuss relations with America and the kind of line they would take,
                    so the teachers had done that. They then developed a simulated dialogue between
                    Snow and Chou that would be used in the special interpreter training course that
                    we were developing.</p>
                <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                <p>I was taking George Yeh around the school, and we came to the classroom where
                    this text they was in use. I explained to Yeh what was going on. This caused a
                    pall in the classroom for a moment there and then Yeh said something like,
                    “That's very interesting. You can certainly get their line in that way.” He was
                    a sophisticated enough man to understand what we were doing. But his hesitation,
                    and the hint of discomfort in his expression, was emblematic of the constant
                    undertone of tension in the school about issues involving U.S.- PRC
                    relations.</p>
                <p>Q: When you were sitting around having a beer with your fellow students and all,
                    what was the feeling at that point about eventual relations and all with
                    communist China and all?</p>
                <p>CUNNINGHAM: We expected in those days that they would come about fairly soon. As
                    I say, I was in the second group to go into language training. The FSI was
                    taking in roughly six officers a year into language training on the assumption
                    that relations with the PRC would be reestablished soon one way or another, and
                    I'll come back to that in a minute. We had 14 or 15 consulates in China prior to
                    the Communist take over and all of us in training assumed all of these posts
                    were going to be reopened so the U.S. would need a lot of Chinese language
                    officers. We thought there was a sky-is-the-limit sort of opportunity for
                    us.</p>
                <p>This was 1956-1957. The Korean War had ended in an armistice in '53. The war in
                    Vietnam had ended in an armistice in 1954. The Warsaw talks had begun soon after
                    that in 1956 or 1957, and they were regarded as an avenue towards the resumption
                    of relations with the PRC. The thought was that we were moving closer to
                    this.</p>
                <p>It was very clear by then that the United States was not going to back an
                    invasion of the mainland by Chiang Kai-shek. That was not fully accepted by the
                    Nationalist Chinese establishment at that time. It did not become fully accepted
                    until after the Quemoy bombardment in 1958. There was also a feeling that the
                    Nationalist regime on Taiwan was not really fully established; it was kind of in
                    a precarious situation and it might not last, and Taiwan might very well be
                    absorbed into the PRC in some fashion. It is not that the United States was
                    supporting that by any means, in fact quite the contrary, but no one in the mid
                    1950s expected that the Republic of China would still be around in the 1990s.
                    You couldn't get anybody to take a bet on that at all. Taiwan in those days was
                    an agrarian economy with a very limited industrial base. The standard of living
                    was very low. It was a poor area. People did have enough to eat and they had
                    reasonably good housing, shelter and clothing, but this was a backward area. No
                    one in those days had the vision of what Taiwan has become today.</p>
                <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                <p>We were preparing in the expectation that within our careers we would be serving
                    in the People's Republic of China. It was not until two things occurred,
                    principally the great leap forward and the hard-line campaigns that began to
                    come out in the PRC at that time, and the escalation of hostilities in Vietnaand
                    this was after we were out of training and into regular diplomatic worthat it
                    became pretty clear that it was going to be a long time until any relationship
                    with China was restored. In those days we sort of expected that we were going to
                    be serving someplace in China in our careers and that it would be within a few
                    years.</p>
                <p>Q: I take it that as far as the officers were concerned who were taking this,
                    there was sort of - maybe it is wrong to characterize it - a certain distance
                    between the new Chinese language officers who were coming out and the
                    Nationalist government. Yes here it is but this is not necessarily something
                    that you want to embrace whole-heartedly.</p>
                <p>CUNNINGHAM: Yes, that is a very good point. Most people finishing their language
                    training had wanted to be assigned to Hong Kong, or one of the other watching
                    posts that we had.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Burma, Indonesia.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNNINGHAM: Yes, something like that. It was not the first desire or preference
                    of anybody in the embassy at that time to be assigned to the American embassy in
                    Taipei. The Chinese language officers in the embassy in Taipei when I arrived in
                    Taichung had gotten their Chinese earlier on. Bill Gleysteen, the consul
                    general, was one of them. He may have taken a little bit in this program but
                    that was just brush-up. I think Bill Thomas might have been there in the
                    economic section but I'm not sure of that. Paul Miller, Sandy Peaslee, Carl
                    Nelson, there were very few people in the embassy in Taipei who were products of
                    the Foreign Service Institute's Chinese language program at that time.</p>
                <p>By the time that I finished I wanted to go to the embassy in Taipei. The reason
                    that I wanted to go there was that I felt the opportunity to further improve the
                    language would be greater there than it would be in going to Hong Kong, which
                    was the major other alternate preference of most of the people. Most of the
                    other people in the class wanted to be assigned to Hong Kong because then they
                    would be getting into PRC affairs. They would be watching China, and they would
                    further improve their knowledge of what was going on in the PRC. The main
                    interest on the part of the group was in the PRC; it was not in the
                    Nationalists, not in Taiwan. They weren't interested in that situation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you got out in July of '58, what happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                <p>CUNNINGHAM: I was sent to the American embassy in Taipei and put in charge of
                    press translations in the embassy there. Once again, I was serving under David
                    Osborn, my mentor from my assignment in Hokkaido eight years previously. Osborn
                    was the Political Counselor, and I was Second Secretary of Embassy. I was also
                    to be responsible for reporting on domestic politics in Taiwan. Ten days after I
                    arrived, the bombardment of Quemoy broke out. By this time Everett Drumright had
                    been assigned to Taipei as the American ambassador. The American embassy had
                    been attacked by a mob the previous year and sacked. Karl Rankin, who had been
                    charg� for a long time, had been named ambassador, left in some disgrace as a
                    result of this, and Drumright was brought in.</p>
                <p>Drumright's influence was very important in that embassy in two or three ways.
                    First of all, he was regarded as a strong supporter of the Nationalists and he
                    had had that identity all the way through his career. I think there were two
                    other important contributions that Drumright made to the operations of the
                    embassy. One of them was that as soon as he got there he said, “I want as many
                    Chinese language officers in the embassy as we can possibly have.” He wanted
                    every substantive position filled by a Chinese language officer. There were six
                    at the time that I reported in August of 1958. As I recall, they were David
                    Osborn, the Political Counselor (he knew Chinese well, but was not as fluent in
                    it as in Japanese) the First Secretary in the Political Section Alexander C.
                    (Sandy) Peaslee, Carl Nelson, Norman Getsinger in the Commercial Section, and
                    two others, whom I do not now recall. By the time I left there were 13.
                    Drumright was absolutely right about having the number of language officers he
                    demanded. It made a significant difference in the way that the Embassy worked,
                    in the conversations that went on among us, in the way that we worked among
                    ourselves, in the way that we exchanged views and perceptions of issues and
                    personalities in Taiwan, and in our perceptions of what was happening in China.
                    By the time Drumright had been there a couple of years it became commonplace for
                    us to work in terms of the Chinese language in discussing what was going on in
                    Taiwan. The communication among us, and the way in which our analyses developed,
                    were very much improved as a result of that. So was our rapport with the Chinese
                    community, with the government, with officialdom, and everybody else with whom
                    we worked. All of that was much stronger as a result of Drumright's emphasis on
                    language capability. He set a high standard in that regard.</p>
                <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                <p>He did another thing that strengthened our relations with the government and the
                    Chinese community. There were frequent automobile accidents in Taiwan involving
                    usually American official vehicles, but sometimes vehicles driven by private
                    Americans, where somebody would get injured. It was a very crowded city. The
                    traffic situation was very bad in Taiwan at that time. There was a lot of mixed
                    traffic with ox carts, bicycles, cyclopeds, trucks, and automobiles. There was
                    very little regulation. People would get injured. They would be hospitalized.
                    There would immediately be an outcry against the Americans that somebody had
                    been irresponsible. They were very sensitive about this. The viewpoint of the
                    Chinese was, you have this enormously powerful machine at your command and you
                    should be able to make it behave. You have so much power you should be able to
                    control that power and not allow accidents to happen. In Chinese mentality the
                    accident is always the fault of the more powerful figure. It is not the result
                    of your conduct; it is the result of who has the greater power advantage.</p>
                <p>This was a very sore point in our relationship with the Chinese community there.
                    Soon after Drumright arrived he said, “We are going to do two things. First of
                    all whenever somebody is injured by an American vehicle of any type, an official
                    vehicle of any kind or anybody in the American official family driving, we are
                    going to immediately visit that person in the hospital and offer condolences.
                    This is not an admission of guilt, we are just going to say we are sorry that
                    this happened and show our compassion in that way. Second, we are going to make
                    and ex-gratia payment. That is to say it is sort of like noblesse oblige in our
                    system. It doesn't represent admission of guilt or responsibility, but it
                    recognizes that someone has been injured and that we want to show our compassion
                    in that way.”</p>
                <p>He arranged for a fund to be set up which was financed by liquor sales through
                    the commissary so that there was in effect a kind of surcharge that came off of
                    this. That went into a fund, which was then used for the purpose of these
                    ex-gratia payments. It was a set-aside, you might say.</p>
                <p>He became known for that and often times when such incidents did take place the
                    newspapers would publish a picture of the representative of the ambassador and
                    whatever organization it was that was involved in the accident, calling on the
                    person in the hospital, presenting flowers, and making an expression of
                    condolences. I think in a few instances Drumright made some of those visits
                    himself. That did a great deal to promote good relations with the community as a
                    whole in Taiwan. I think Drumright deserves a lot of credit for all of that.</p>
                <p>These were things that Drumright instituted because he realized that the Chinese
                    should not perceive us as a kind of imperial authority or colonial authority. He
                    felt that some of the things that had gone on prior to that had given that
                    perception.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Extraterritorial privileges.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                <p>CUNNINGHAM: Yes, the extraterritorial privileges and all of that. He wanted to
                    erase that kind of stigma, or at least blemish, or at least counteract that to
                    the extent that he could. He was very insistent on that kind of an approach
                    toward the Chinese.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this also to diffuse the riot that had sacked the
                        embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNNINGHAM: Oh yes, definitely.</p>
                <p>Q: Could you explain how that came about and if it had any reflection down at the
                    school?</p>
                <p>CUNNINGHAM: This is pretty sketchy because I was not involved in this; I was at
                    the language school at the time. What happened was that one evening an American
                    sergeant who was in the provost marshal's office in the American military
                    advisory group in Taipei, shot and killed a Chinese whom he accused of being a
                    peeping tom who had been peeping in the window at the sergeant's wife in their
                    quarters. He went out, shot this man, and killed him. It turned out that the man
                    who was shot was a member of the intelligence service of the Taiwan Garrison
                    Command, the supreme military authority at that time, which was under the
                    direction of Chiang Ching-kuo, the son of the President, Chiang Kai-shek. The
                    Nationalists had declared martial law when they moved their capital to Taipei in
                    December 1950. Their rationale was that China, including Taiwan, was in a state
                    of civil war, warranting suspension of civil rights.</p>
                <p>The sergeant was subjected to a court martial by a U.S. military court in Taipei.
                    There was a great outcry that he should have been tried in a Chinese civil
                    court, but under the UROC status of forces agreement that could be done only if
                    the U.S. waived jurisdiction. The U.S. would not waive jurisdiction and
                    therefore this man would be tried in an American military court and subjected to
                    a court martial. He was not convicted of homicide. The trial was witnessed of
                    course by members of the man's family and others. There was a very strong
                    feeling in the Chinese community that he was guilty and should be convicted of
                    homicide.</p>
                <p>As soon as the verdict had been handed down U.S. military aircraft evacuated the
                    sergeant from Taiwan immediately, I think within hours of the verdict. That
                    effectively removed him from any possibility of being subjected to a judicial
                    process under the Chinese system. There was resentment about this and the next
                    day a crowd gathered outside of the American embassy compound protesting this
                    action as unjust on the part of the United States and accusing the Americans of
                    all kinds of bad deeds.</p>
                <pb facs="0067" n="Page0067"/>
                <p>The protest was very interesting because it was about six months after we arrived
                    in Taiwan and the students at the language school were scheduled to make a field
                    trip to Hong Kong. We had all traveled to Taipei and had been in hotels the
                    night before when all this build up was going on. I think it was the night of
                    the day the trial took place and the sergeant was evacuated from Taiwan. There
                    were an awful lot of people in the streets the following morning as we were
                    going to the airport to get on the plane.</p>
                <p>In order to make the field trip, I had driven up to Taipei with my wife in my
                    1956 Plymouth Coupe purchased through the American Foreign Service Association's
                    diplomatic purchasing program. We had arranged with a chauffeur from the
                    American embassy to drive us in my car to the airport so we could board the
                    plane, then he was going to drive it back to the embassy and put it in the
                    compound for safe keeping. Well he did. He got it back to the compound, and
                    drove it in the gates about 15 minutes before the mob came over the wall. It was
                    safely inside the American compound. It got beat up a little bit in the ensuing
                    disturbances but it was not burned or basically damaged. I did receive damages
                    from the Nationalist government and bought a replacement automobile as a result
                    of that.</p>
                <p>Anyway, the mob came over the wall and they sacked the American embassy, in
                    effect. They didn't burn it but they smashed it up very badly. The thing that
                    was particularly symbolic was that the ambassador's limousine was parked in the
                    port-coch�re. The car was moved out, turned upside down, and a three-way
                    combination safe was pushed out of an upstairs window and dropped onto the
                    overturned ambassador's limousine. I think this was a definite symbolic act on
                    the part of the people who had taken over the embassy. Embassy order was
                    restored and the people were evicted from the compound. Americans have always
                    been told that hooligans committed this sort of thing.</p>
                <p>Of course by this time all of us from the language school were in Hong Kong, and
                    the next morning we were reading in the newspapers that the American embassy in
                    Taipei had been sacked immediately after our departure. Everybody in the
                    consulate general wanted to know what in the world was going on, and what this
                    signified for the relationship between the United States and the Republic of
                    China, and the PRC as well. That is sort of a thumbnail sketch of the story.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the general belief? That this was done with
                        thtolerance of the Nationalist government?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0068" n="Page0068"/>
                <p>CUNNINGHAM: Yes, the general belief was that nothing like that would happen in
                    Taiwan unless the government was willing to allow it to take place. Now the
                    government may not have intended that it go as far as it did. They might have
                    intended for it to be a protest demonstration that would not get out of hand. It
                    may have gotten out of hand and gone somewhat farther than they intended. You
                    have to understand that emotions were running very high over this. This man who
                    had been murdered had been a member of the intelligence service and there were a
                    lot of people who felt strongly about his death and about the way the whole
                    affair had been conducted. As to the merits of the case and as to whether the
                    sergeant should have been convicted or not, I can't really comment because I
                    don't have a clear enough recollection of it.</p>
                <p>Q: Just one question before we finish this language school time. Were there any
                    sort of half-life lingering problems about being a China hand from the McCarthy
                    times by the time you came in or was that pretty well over?</p>
                <p>CUNNINGHAM: I think there still are, frankly, in a manner of speaking. Everybody
                    in my time who specialized in Chinese was conscious of what happened to those
                    people. I don't think very many of us knew them personally though some of us had
                    the opportunity to get to know some of them later on. I think that there was the
                    unspoken feeling that there was a line that you had to be very careful about,
                    particularly in the 1950s, in dealing with Chinese affairs, in dealing with the
                    PRC.</p>
                <p>I remember very well that this was the period of the so-called three Walters:
                    Walter Robertson, the Assistant Secretary for Far Eastern Affairs in the
                    Eisenhower Administration; Walter McConaughy, the Director of Chinese Affairs
                    after Edwin Martin, and Walter Judd, former American medical missionary in
                    China, a close friend of the Chiang family, and then U.S. Representative from
                    Minnesota in the Congress. All three of them had very strong views about the
                    People's Republic of China, the Chinese communists, so one wrote and analyzed in
                    consciousness of what their attitude was. That doesn't necessarily mean that you
                    slanted the reports, but what I think it means is that if you are going to
                    recommend a particular line of action or a particular policy, you had to work
                    very hard to have the documentation, the support, and the argument for it lined
                    up. Drumright was regarded as being sympathetic or congenial toward, or
                    receptive to, compatible with, the thinking typified by the “Three Walters”. We
                    felt that probably the United States did not challenge or question the basis of
                    ROC policy and the kind of line the ROC wanted us to take.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: ROC being?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNNINGHAM: The Republic of China, the Chinese Nationalists of Chiang Kai-shek.
                    They didn't want to challenge that as objectively as we might have, had this
                    whole period been absent from the relationship.</p>
                <pb facs="0069" n="Page0069"/>
                <p>Q: There was a very strong China lobby too, particularly in Congress with Senator
                    Noland of California, Walter Judd of Minnesota, and others. Walter Judd was from
                    a missionary background.</p>
                <p>CUNNINGHAM: Medical missionary, yes. I met Walter Judd in Saigon during the time
                    that I was there. Walter Judd knows China and knows the Chinese people, there is
                    no question about that, but he had a particular point of view. I guess that is
                    it; we were conscious of the point of view in doing our work and in doing our
                    reporting and analysis.You mentioned the China lobby. The China lobby was very
                    strong, very influential. You had to reckon with it also. That is to say you had
                    to be conscious of the atmosphere in which your reports and analyses were going
                    to be read in Washington and that in the background were the lingering
                    influences of the 1940s China lobby. In fact also in the background was the
                    continuing influence of the successor to the 1940s China lobby, and that China
                    lobby still operates today. In fact we've got at least two China lobbies that
                    are operating in the United States, not as an organized entity, but as a body of
                    opinion. That has an influence upon the thinking, or at least attempts to
                    influence the thinking, of the United States government and the American people
                    with regard to China.</p>
                <p>Q: I might just add a footnote. In a way it is similar to the one other one,
                    which would be dealing with Israel. It is the same sort of understanding about
                    the atmosphere in which you are dealing, a highly political, a highly charged
                    atmosphere that one has to understand.</p>
                <p>CUNNINGHAM: That's right, politically charged, and sensitive, anyou have to be
                    conscious of that, absolutely.</p>
                <p>Q: It only is interesting in developments later on, was there much contact
                    between the embassy during this time that you were with the embassy in Taiwan,
                    and the Taiwanese?</p>
                <pb facs="0070" n="Page0070"/>
                <p>CUNNINGHAM: I was the first Taiwanese language officer in the embassy. The last
                    four months that I was in Taichung in the language school, I asked to spend half
                    my time studying Taiwanese because I knew by then what job I would be going
                    into. The last month that I was there I lived in Lu Kang, one of the first
                    villages settled by people coming across from the mainland in the 17th century.
                    The Taiwanese that was spoken was considered as the authentic version of the
                    language. My Taiwanese was never as good as my Mandarin. I continued my
                    Taiwanese studies in the embassy and had a tutor, as a matter of fact.I got to
                    know many of the leading Taiwanese opposition figures very well. I was the only
                    embassy officer that ever was in contact with some of them. These were senior
                    people who had also fought Japanese rule in some instances, though not all were
                    in that category. But they were all united in their opposition to the
                    undemocratic rule of the ROC in Taiwan. Again that was the sort of thing my KMT
                    Chinese contacts often questioned me about, this work that I was doing. At one
                    point I had to be somewhat circumspect about this because the intelligence
                    services of the KMT were constantly feeding stuff back to the embassy saying,
                    “Cunningham was seeing certain people and we wonder what is going on? Does this
                    represent a decision by the United States to support the Taiwan independence
                    movement, Thomas Liao and other people overseas who were Taiwanese
                    Nationalists?”</p>
                <p>Yes, that was a sensitive area but it is to Drumright's credit that he did not
                    tell me to not have contact with these people. I think that Osborn, who on an
                    earlier tour to Taiwan developed some of these contacts and was conscious of
                    their views, felt that it was important to know these people and to at least
                    allow them to be in contact with the U.S. government and feel that they were
                    getting their point of view across. I think that he persuaded Drumright to allow
                    that, but at the same time the word would come back to me that this kind of
                    report had been coming into the embassy and that they were wondering what was up
                    and maybe I should back off a little bit for a while.</p>
                <p>As an example, there was one time when Lindsey Grant, an economic officer in the
                    embassy and a Chinese language officer for whom I worked later on, and a couple
                    of other fellows from the embassy and I, took a cross-island hike on what was
                    known as the power line trail; it followed the Taiwan Power Company's east-west
                    transmission line across the island. The mountains are very high. You got up to
                    10,000 feet. Lindsey is a great hiker and so he said, “We've been talking about
                    doing this,” so we finally took the power line trail hike across the island.</p>
                <p>After this hike when we got back, the report got back to the embassy that
                    Cunningham had been up in the mountains and he had been talking to people up
                    there so he must also know how to speak mountain languages. Mountain languages
                    are the aboriginal languages of the Melanesian people who had migrated to Taiwan
                    even before the Chinese had arrived in the 15th century. It was that kind of
                    fantastic thing that was coming back to them. I was regarded as a questionable
                    character in that respect by the KMT authorities.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just to finish up this part, and then we will wrap this up
                        fothis session, you started in '58 going to our embassy in Taipei?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNNINGHAM: I was assigned to the embassy in August of 1958. I was put in charge
                    of press translations. My job was to produce a consolidated press translation
                    comparable to the summary of the China mainland press produced by the Consulate
                    General in Hong Kong in those days. I did that and I ran it for about three
                    years. In 1961 I was sent back to Taichung as Director of the Language School.
                    That came about because the then Director, Howard Levy, who also knew Japanese,
                    was transferred by the Foreign Service Institute on an emergency basis to
                    Yokohama to take over FSI's Japanese language school there. There was a sudden,
                    unexpected vacancy there. I went for one year as Director of the language school
                    to fill in until FSI could get a professional scholar to come out and run
                    it.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We'll pick it up the next time at that point. What are
                        some othe subjects that we might pick up next time about Taipei?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNNINGHAM: One of them is the change or the affirmation of the policies of the
                    KMT with regard to return to the mainland in the wake of the Quemoy bombardment.
                    Also Secretary Dulles' visit in the fall of 1958, including what happened at the
                    state dinner for Dulles. That was one of his last overseas trips by the way. We
                    should also cover the China Democratic Party and its rise and what happened in
                    opposition politics during those three years when I was covering that. The
                    establishment of what was involved in setting up the daily press translation
                    service in the American embassy from 1958-59. The visits of Eisenhower and
                    Lyndon Johnson, both of which occurred during this period of time. One of them
                    happened after I had gone to Taichung and I came back to work on it. Those were
                    some of the things that I can think of now. Also, the whole business of Taiwan's
                    economy taking off during this period and the decisions in regard to the
                    economic development of Taiwan during that period, and the encouragement of a
                    consumer economy in Taiwan by the U.S. government and USAID.</p>
                <p>***</p>
                <p>Q: Today is the 22nd of March 1999. This interview is taking place in Houston
                    Texas. Bill, before we move on to the taking over of the Chinese training in
                    1961, you had some remarks you wanted to make prior to that about things that
                    had happened.</p>
                <p>CUNNINGHAM: If I can remember them in order. The first was the affirmation of the
                    return to the mainland policy of Chiang Kai-shek and the KMT in the wake of the
                    Quemoy bombardment. I think I may have said previously that I arrived at the
                    American embassy in Taipei on transfer from Taichung, which is only 100 miles
                    away, about ten days before the outbreak of the bombardment of Quemoy on August
                    24, 1958. The date sticks in my mind; it is unforgettable.</p>
                <pb facs="0072" n="Page0072"/>
                <p>The bombardment of Quemoy caused great alarm at the time particularly because it
                    was not clear whether the PRC was attempting to reduce the fortress of Quemoy
                    preparatory to conducting an amphibious operation against the islands,
                    particularly against Quemoy, which is right in the mouth of the harbor of Amoy
                    and effectively blockades it. It is only about a mile and a half offshore. That
                    whole question of whether an actual invasion was going to take place; the issue
                    of whether or not under the treaty of mutual defense that the United States had
                    with the Republic of China on Taiwan at the time, was applicable to Quemoy or
                    not; and the obligations of the United States to its ally, the Republic of
                    China, under those circumstances; all of those things were very much at
                    issue.</p>
                <p>Of course it is important for people to understand historically that every
                    incident that occurred in the Cold War, particularly any incident involving the
                    use of armed force, was automatically regarded as a litmus test of the
                    reliability of the United States as a supporter of its allies all around the
                    world in all of these mutual defense treaties that we had concluded from Europe
                    to Japan and Korea by that time. What we did in the Taiwan Straits inevitably
                    would be looked upon by every other ally of the United States as a test of the
                    reliability of the United States under any kind of armed attack. Nowadays in
                    1999, the eve of the 21st century, it is very hard for people to understand the
                    atmosphere of that time, so it is important to put that in context.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was our analysis at the time out of our embassy on
                        Taiwaabout what was the intention of the People's Republic of China?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNNINGHAM: Actually what we were concentrating on more was what would the
                    Republic of China do in response to it? It was this kind of situation where in
                    the technical sense, in terms of international relations, the legitimacy of the
                    Republic of China was under attack by the PRC. The position of the Republic of
                    China's government, Chiang Kai-shek's government, the Nationalists at that time,
                    was that China was in a state of uncompleted civil war and the PRC regime in the
                    legal sense, in the juridical sense, was a rebel rump organization that was
                    attempting to overthrow the legally established constitutional government of the
                    Republic of China. Therefore the Republic of China had the obligation in defense
                    of its national sovereignty and constitutionality to suppress this rebellion.
                    That was the official position. So long as there were no on-going hostilities
                    between the two sides that was simply a formal position without an actual policy
                    of implementation, you might say.</p>
                <pb facs="0073" n="Page0073"/>
                <p>Not only that, the U.S. Seventh Fleet was “patrolling” the Taiwan Strait.
                    Initially it had been sent there to prevent the outbreak of hostilities
                    initiated by either side back at the time of the Korean War. The situation had
                    changed by 1958. By 1958 the treaty of mutual defense between the United States
                    and Taiwan had replaced the earlier order to the Seventh Fleet of President
                    Truman. In effect the Seventh Fleet was acting more as an ally in defense of
                    Taiwan's territorial integrity and immunity from attack than it was as a buffer.
                    Its mission was no longer as it had been at the outset to prevent the
                    Nationalists from initiating an attack on the mainland so much as it was to
                    protect Taiwan from an attack by the PRC against Taiwan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the ambassador at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNNINGHAM: The ambassador at that time was Everett Drumright. Drumright had
                    arrived the previous May having previously been consul general in Hong Kong.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: An old China hand.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNNINGHAM: Yes, an old China hand from the 1930s, trained in the language school
                    in Beijing. Interestingly enough Drumright was in China at the embassy in
                    Chungking during the Second World War in the 1940s when Clarence Gauss was the
                    ambassador there and when John Stewart Service, John Carter Vincent, John Paton
                    Davies, Jr., and all of the other famous China hands were serving there. During
                    part of that time the Dixie mission was sent from Chungking to Yenan. It
                    included John Stewart Service and I think Raymond Ludden and David “the dog”
                    Barrett the military attach�, a very colorful guy, and I think John Carter
                    Vincent though I'm not sure. During this same period they were in Yenan, the
                    wartime headquarters of the Communist Chinese Party, in the winter of 1944-45,
                    Drumright was in Sian at the U.S. Consulate there, perhaps as principal officer.
                    Sian is not far from Yenan; both are in Shaanxi province.</p>
                <p>In fact many years later - - in 1980 - - when I visited Sian I happened to go to
                    a restaurant for dinner with a senior Communist Party provincial official, and
                    he said, “This is the restaurant that Chou En-lai used to like to come to when
                    he wanted to get out of Yenan and come down to town.”</p>
                <p>But Sian at that time was under Nationalist control. It was the Nationalist
                    outpost for watching what was going on in the communist headquarters in Yenan
                    less than 100 miles away. Drumright's formation in Chinese affairs during the
                    winter of 1944-45 while the Dixie mission was in Yenan was very much under the
                    influence of the Nationalists. So it was the Chungking and Sian experiences and
                    relationships developed at that time, as well as the policy positions in the
                    late 1940s with which Drumright, then in the Department, was associated that
                    made him very much a welcomed figure when he arrived in 1958 in Taipei from Hong
                    Kong.</p>
                <pb facs="0074" n="Page0074"/>
                <p>Q: During this '58 to '60 period, were the expectations that the Nationalists
                    would try to do anything, launch any attack, or was that pretty well over?</p>
                <p>CUNNINGHAM: That was the key question in August of 1958 when the attack began.
                    There were people in the leadership of the Kuomintang who saw this attack upon
                    Quemoy as a military provocation that would justify military action by the
                    Nationalists against the China mainland. In other words, here was an opportunity
                    that would provide them the political cover necessary to actually implement the
                    campaign for recovery of the mainland that the Generalissimo said was his
                    obligation and constitutional mission. In the embassy in Taipei at the time, we
                    were very much concerned as to whether the Nationalists were really going to try
                    to do this.</p>
                <p>One of the first things that happened was additional units of the U.S. military
                    were moved to Taiwan soon after the attack began. We beefed up our units there
                    from about 10,000 men to about 13,000. We moved some combat air force units from
                    Clark Air Force Base into air bases on Taiwan. That was intended as a warning to
                    the communists, the PRC, not to try to attack Taiwan.</p>
                <p>There is something that is very important to understand here historically. The
                    treaty of mutual defense concluded in 1953 between the United States and Taiwan
                    covered only Taiwan and the Pescadores. The Pescadores are about one-third the
                    way across the Taiwan Strait to the mainland, and juridically are part of
                    Taiwan. China had ceded them to Japan in 1895 along with Taiwan itself. The
                    mutual defense treaty did not cover the offshore islands of Quemoy and Matsu.
                    Those were the responsibility of the Nationalists and the Republic of China.</p>
                <p>The other interesting thing about it is that under the doctrine of the United
                    States at the time the juridical status of Taiwan and the Pescadores were
                    “undetermined.” This came from John Foster Dulles, the great international
                    lawyer. There was absolutely no question about the juridical status of the
                    offshore islands of Quemoy and Matsu; they are juridically Chinese territory and
                    everybody recognizes that. They are not part of the province of Taiwan. Quemoy
                    and Matsu are part of the provinces of Fujian and Zhejiang on the mainland. The
                    treaty of mutual defense did not cover Quemoy and Matsu. Militarily they were
                    the responsibility of the Republic of China.</p>
                <p>Also, if the PRC were to take those two islands militarily, in a symbolic sense
                    they would have removed from territory that, as part of the mainland provinces,
                    was indisputably Chinese. That would not of itself have destroyed the
                    Nationalist, or ROC, government, but would have left it in control only of
                    territory which both claimed, but which had not been retroceded to either
                    Beijing or Taipei by the San Francisco and related Peace treaties. In a
                    conceptual sense separate status for Taiwan, including the Pescadores, would
                    have gained some moral legitimacy. You can see how that line of argument could
                    have developed. This kind of symbolic issue was part of the mix at the time.</p>
                <pb facs="0075" n="Page0075"/>
                <p>Our job in the American embassy was on the one hand to shape the response of the
                    Republic of China, the Nationalists, in such a way as to discourage any attack
                    upon Taiwan itself by the PRC. In other words we did not want to get into a
                    situation where we would come into armed conflict with the Chinese. That was the
                    first thing. The second thing is that in encouraging the Republic of China, or
                    dissuading the Republic of China from doing anything that would involve us with
                    direct combat with the PRC, we also wanted to leave the responsibility for the
                    defense, for actually military combat, with the PRC entirely in their hands. But
                    we didn't want them to use the military action as a pretext for committing
                    themselves to a military campaign against the mainland. It was all very
                    complicated and very delicate.</p>
                <p>Q: How about at your level, and other officers at your level, were you trying to
                    make this point or were you leaving this to the ambassador?</p>
                <p>CUNNINGHAM: We were following it very closely. We had a very small political
                    section. There were four officers there. David Osborn, now deceased, was the
                    counselor for political affairs, and Sandy Peaslee, also now deceased, was his
                    principal deputy. A man by the name of Carl Nelson, who is still living in
                    Florida, was the third officer, and I was the junior officer. Dealings with the
                    ROC leadership all was being carried out by the ambassador, the DCM at the time
                    who I think was Joseph Yager, and David Osborn. They were the people who were
                    dealing with the top levels of the ROC, and I should make it clear here that
                    Ambassador Drumright, despite his antipathy toward the PRC and his sympathy for
                    the ROC, was loyal to U.S. policy and carried it out effectively. Most of us in
                    the Political Section were following the popular reaction to this. I was very
                    new on the scene. I was really trying to get my bearings at this point trying to
                    figure out what was going on.</p>
                <p>The main point right here is that in October 1958 things got very tense. This
                    bombardment went on and on. At one point the Republic of China was accusing the
                    United States of disloyalty to its allies. As long as the bombardment went on
                    the question came up, how was this garrison on Quemoy going to be sustained?
                    These guys had to be resupplied. Artillery was being fired off at a great rate.
                    The PRC was attempting to blockade the island of Quemoy by bombardment. How were
                    supplies going to get out there?</p>
                <p>What it really came down to eventually after a lot of back and forth between
                    Washington and Taipei, and also between the embassy and the Nationalist
                    government, the ROC government, was the ROC's responsibility to resupply Quemoy.
                    The ROC's response to this was, what the hell kind of an ally are you? Here our
                    soldiers are in danger out there on the front lines and you are not going to
                    help with the resupply? You are not going to help send in ammunition? We said,
                    “Well, that is the other side of the Strait and it is not covered by the
                    Treaty.” This really helped to define the application of the Treaty very
                    clearly.</p>
                <pb facs="0076" n="Page0076"/>
                <p>What finally happened was that it was decided that the vessels of the Seventh
                    Fleet - I think it was probably one destroyer escort - would convoy the resupply
                    vessels of the ROC navy from Taiwan up to a certain line in the Strait of
                    Taiwan. From there on they had to make the run for the beach, basically, on
                    their own with whatever protection they were able to provide.</p>
                <p>Then the question came up, where do we draw the line? Is it the territorial seas?
                    Well all right, the U.S. decided to draw the line at the territorial sea limit.
                    We could convoy these vessels so long as they were in international waters but
                    the demarcation point then came to be the territorial sea limit. Well, whose
                    territorial sea limit?; according to what interpretation? At the time the U.S.
                    interpretation was three miles. Three miles from where? Three miles from the
                    beach line at Quemoy, or three miles from the beach line over on the other side
                    of the strait on the mainland? If we got that far over it was certain that any
                    U.S. vessels would come under fire from shore batteries on the mainland. We
                    didn't want to get involved in this thing so we didn't want to go that far.
                    There was some talk at that time about the six mile limit and I think the U.S.
                    was pushing this as a compromise to the proposal for a twelve mile limit
                    advocated by some countries at the time as an international standard, but that
                    hadn't really been recognized yet. Even the, again it was the same thing, six
                    miles from where?</p>
                <p>I think at this point this dispute became public and Beijing came up on this, the
                    New China News Agency, and pointed out that so far as they were concerned the
                    territorial sea limit was 12 miles. Well again it was 12 miles from where? Could
                    it be the beach line at Quemoy or could it be the beach line on the mainland. In
                    retrospect, and perhaps at the time, I think this PRC announcement was intended
                    as a signal to the U.S. that Beijing did not want to have a military encounter
                    with the U.S. Setting the twelve mile limit from the point on the most extreme
                    seaward point of Quemoy at low tide would, if respected by the U.S., put
                    American navy vessels at just about the extreme range of PRC shore batteries, if
                    not beyond their range.</p>
                <p>Frankly I can't remember how all of that sorted itself out, but at any rate at
                    the time that it was finally sorted out, U.S. vessels did actually escort the
                    re-supply vessels from Taiwan out into the Taiwan Strait and they stopped at a
                    certain point. I do not remember now how that point was defined but in any case
                    it was very carefully calibrated to take into account all of these conflicting
                    interpretations and it was done in such a way that it did not commit the U.S. to
                    recognize any particular territorial sea limit. In other words it was a
                    political decision and it was made pretty clear. I'm pretty sure that by this
                    point the PRC understood that we weren't going to put ourselves in any situation
                    that would compel their shore batteries to take our vessels under fire. We
                    avoided it in that way. We fuzzed it up in that true American diplomatic
                    sense.</p>
                <pb facs="0077" n="Page0077"/>
                <p>The second thing is that while all this was going on there was a contest for
                    control of the air over the Taiwan Strait. We supplied the Republic of China air
                    force with sidewinder missiles, which they used to great effect. I think the
                    kill rate was something like 30-to-one in the air battles over the Taiwan
                    Strait. That meant then that very early in the battles it was not possible for
                    the PRC air force to attack any re-supply lines from the air. I think that
                    helped us in our negotiations with the ROC to determine this political
                    demarcation point in the waters of the Taiwan Strait. It was very complicated
                    business.</p>
                <p>The media in Taiwan was controlled so they would release statements by
                    “political” figures, leading military strategists and so forth, in the press
                    there intended to psychologically coerce us into adopting the position most
                    favorable to them. It was not always the one that our military wanted to adopt.
                    The military did not want to get into a fight with the PRC at this point.</p>
                <p>Drumright's job was very delicate. On the one hand he was recently arrived, he
                    had very good credentials with the ROC, they liked him. He was on good terms
                    with the Gimo. They thought he was okay. He was reliable. He wasn't one of the
                    China crowd in the State Department that was trying to sell out the Gimo. He
                    didn't have that identity at all. In order to maintain his access to them he had
                    to retain that image with them.</p>
                <p>On the other hand he had to utilize it to cool off the hot heads, most
                    particularly a fellow by the name of Tiger Wang who was the commander of the ROC
                    air force at that point and was a real gung ho sort of a person. He talked
                    publicly as though he was ready to order his forces to go across the Strait and
                    lay PRC military installations waste. He seemed to figure that they could. Of
                    course when the ROC air force got the sidewinder air-to-air defense missile,
                    which proved extremely effective in dogfights with the PRC air force, that made
                    them feel even more invincible. Drumright had to sort of cool off that element
                    within the ROC military establishment; I think there were a lot of generals who
                    wanted to gain favor with the Gimo (Chiang Kai-shek) and avenge the defeat they
                    had experienced on the mainland ten years earlier.</p>
                <p>It is very difficult for a soldier. Your comrades are under attack and you want
                    to protect them; you want to show that you are tough and strong and you're
                    militant and all the rest. On the other hand I think there were some cool heads
                    among the ROC military who realized that this could be a pretty sticky operation
                    if they really got into ground combat with the PRC. They weren't itching for it
                    but on the other hand they had to look like they were really going to make a big
                    scrap out of it if it really took place.</p>
                <pb facs="0078" n="Page0078"/>
                <p>For a period from the beginning of the artillery battle in August until October
                    when John Foster Dulles came out on his trip in 1958. Dulles was ill with
                    terminal cancer at the time. He had either just been to Rome for the funeral of
                    Pius XII or he was going their after his stop in Taiwan. Three months later he
                    resigned and Christian Herter became secretary of State. Dulles was a sick man
                    and he came out at a crucial point when this whole matter of the outcome of the
                    battle was undecided; that is the political outcome, the military outcome. Would
                    it be extended to the mainland? Would we get involved? By this time we had units
                    of the Fifth Air Force, combat units, on Taiwan. We had beefed our military up
                    by about 3,000 people. In effect we were saying to the PRC, if you are going to
                    make a fight out of this we are ready to go.</p>
                <p>Dulles came out for these negotiations with the Generalissimo. I remember this
                    period very, very well indeed. I do not know the content of his conversations
                    with the Generalissimo but they were very intense, and of course the
                    Nationalists greatly trusted Dulles. The fact that he made the trip, it seems
                    that it was necessary for him to go and say to them, on the one hand we are not
                    going to abandon you, but on the other hand you must understand that we are not
                    looking for a new opportunity to enter into combat with the PRC. We understand
                    that you have to protect the position that you have adopted and we are not
                    trying to in any way diminish that or detract from it but we are not going to
                    back you up militarily if you carry this fight to the PRC on the mainland. That
                    was the implicit message, I believe, Dulles came out to convey. He left and the
                    issue was still in doubt. No one really knew whether the Generalissimo had taken
                    this on board and was going to go along with it, or not.</p>
                <p>At that point, I believe it was after Dulles had left, the Generalissimo called
                    in the AP correspondent in Taipei, a man by the name of Spencer Moosa. Moosa was
                    a man of uncertain nationality who had been covering China for the AP for a very
                    long time, including on the mainland. Some people say he was Lebanese. Some
                    people say he was Russian. He had a wife who had another nationality and all. He
                    was one of these strange people who floated around in the atmosphere of the
                    1930s and 1940s China.</p>
                <p>Moosa was a seasoned and responsible journalist, and he had the trust of Chiang
                    Kai-shek. When the Gimo had something that he wanted to get across indirectly,
                    he would do it through Moosa. We had learned to watch Moosa's reporting very
                    carefully. Most of the time it was pretty mundane and there was not much in it,
                    but every once in a while there was an important story. Moosa would be the
                    reporter to cover it, and of course we would interview Moosa to get a fuller
                    background on this sort of thing. As I remember Moosa was not particularly
                    forthcoming. He would dissimulate very skillfully under those circumstances in
                    part to protect his access to the ROC.</p>
                <pb facs="0079" n="Page0079"/>
                <p>At any rate after Dulles left the Gimo called Moosa in for an interview that was
                    put out in question and answer formaand this was very unusual. I think it was
                    put out on the 20th of October 1958 if I'm not mistaken. It seems to me that's
                    the date, right about then. I'm not sure whether Moosa actually saw the Gimo or
                    whether he submitted questions in advance and then called on the Gimo and the
                    Gimo said in response to question number one this is my answer, etc. It was
                    quite lengthy. Ten to 15 questions were asked and responded to in question and
                    answer format. It was put out by AP, the Central Daily News, and the Central
                    News Agency of Taipei.</p>
                <p>We had a big debate within the political section over this interview as to what
                    it meant. I was in on it. Carl Nelson was in on it. Sandy Peaslee was in on it.
                    I don't know if Dave Osborn was in on it or not. We disputed it back and forth.
                    The reason I remember this is that it came out on a Friday and in those days we
                    were always doing the Weeka every Friday.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's the weekly report, a round up of the week's
                        news.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNNINGHAM: Everything. Political, economic, psychological, military, and so
                    forth. We had a big debate over this. This came out just as we were preparing
                    the week-up so we had to get out a report on it, and we also had to get it into
                    the week-up. Because it came out on a Friday we had to get it right for that
                    weekly report that had to go out every Friday afternoon. It had to be ready
                    about 3:00 for all the top levels to sign off on.</p>
                <p>We had this furious debate over it and I can't remember the particulars of it,
                    but I'm going to take a little credit for it myself here as the junior officer
                    of the embassy, newly arrived, less than three months on post by that time. Carl
                    Nelson was on one side of the argument. Carl is a man I like very much, a
                    wonderful man, and a good friend. Carl put a particular interpretation on the
                    interview and I won't try to characterize it now because I don't remember it
                    exactly. What I remember saying in this debate that we had in the political
                    section was, “But Carl, if that was what Chiang Kai-shek meant, he would not
                    have said this,” and I pointed to a particular paragraph. It turned out that I
                    had spotted the key phrase in the paragraph which maintained the Generalissimo's
                    political position vis-�-vis the PRC, but he plainly wanted it to be inferred
                    that no broader ROC military action was going to take place. That is to say that
                    no attempt to extend military action from Taiwan on the offshore islands to the
                    mainland was going to take place.</p>
                <pb facs="0080" n="Page0080"/>
                <p>That interview is absolutely vital to understanding the outcome of the Taiwan
                    Strait crisis. The interpretation that was sent in from the embassy was the
                    interpretation based upon the sentence that I had identified. It amazes me still
                    that all the officers in the political section, far more experienced that I,
                    didn't see that, but I was the guy who saw it so I will take a little bit of
                    credit for myself on that one. Soon after that took place and after this was
                    made clear and became the prevailing interpretation within the diplomatic
                    establishment, the gun battle began to taper off. In other words both sides got
                    the message that nothing more was going to happen and eventually it came down to
                    the alternate day shelling, propaganda shells, lengthening periods - such as
                    holiday seasons - of suspended shelling, and all that kind of thing.</p>
                <p>The other thing that happened, and it is very important to remember during this
                    period of time, the deputy chief of mission was not Joseph Yager. The deputy
                    chief of mission was a man by the name of Sterling Cottrell. Cottrell was a
                    Latin Americanist. He had never been in Asia. I don't know how it was that he
                    came in or how he was assigned but he arrived more or less simultaneously with
                    Drumright. Cottrell was the kind of guy who liked to ingratiate himself with the
                    embassy staff. He did all kinds of things that, now I realize as I've learned
                    more about Latin America, were kind of in the Latin America macho style which
                    really doesn't go over in East Asia, and it didn't go over with Drumright
                    either.</p>
                <p>At any rate, the last thing that happened before Dulles went home in October of
                    1958 was that the Generalissimo had him to dinner up at the residence. It was
                    very formal. Of course the ambassador was there, Cottrell was there, the
                    commander of the Taiwan defense command, and the head of the military advisory
                    group were there. All of the top brass were there and I've forgotten who else.
                    There were toasts exchanged. I guess first the Generalissimo as the host offered
                    a toast. This was done in a very formal way and of course there was an
                    interpreter, a prepared text, and all the rest. The secretary did not have a
                    prepared text so he extemporized in response. The exchange was substantive. It
                    related to what was going on at the time, and was very important. Drumright of
                    course with all of his years of experience recognized this and recognized the
                    importance of the nuances in this exchange.</p>
                <p>After the dinner was over everybody came back to the embassy still in black tie.
                    Drumright turned to Cottrell, his deputy and said, “Okay, write up the report of
                    this exchange particularly the secretary's statement.” Cottrell said, “I'll do
                    the best I can from memory.” Drumright turned to him and said, “You didn't take
                    notes?” Cottrell said, “No, I didn't take notes.” Drumright had just about had
                    it with Cottrell by then. He was furious and said, “That means now that we have
                    to rely on their version.” (End tape)</p>
                <p>There's another thing about my responsibilities in the embassy that I ought to
                    cover. I had two responsibilities. The first was to set up the daily translation
                    of the Chinese press.</p>
                <pb facs="0081" n="Page0081"/>
                <p>In Hong Kong there was the daily translation of the China mainland press, the
                    summary of the China mainland press, as it was known. It was a very
                    distinguished operation, well established, and highly regarded. Drumright had
                    been accustomed to that as consul general in Hong Kong. When he arrived in
                    Taiwan he found that there was no comparable publication in the American embassy
                    in Taipei.</p>
                <p>There were at the time seven or eight daily newspapers. Six of them were morning
                    papers and two of them were evening papers. They ran the gamut the Central Daily
                    News, the official organ of the Kuomintang party, to an independent paper called
                    the Ta Kung Pao, the great public newspaper, which was an opposition organ to
                    the extent that one could have an opposition organ at the time. The other
                    newspapers fell somewhere in between the two. Some were independently owned.
                    Some were pro-government. One was an economic daily newspaper. Two of them were
                    evening papers.</p>
                <p>The Taiwan Defense Command, the Naval Auxiliary Communications Center, which was
                    the CIA operation in Taiwan at the time, the American embassy, and the U.S.
                    Information Service, each had a press translation operation and each was
                    publishing its own summary of the Chinese press. Some were publishing them twice
                    a week, some once a week, some three times a week, and so on. They were all
                    independent publications.When the bombardment of Quemoy broke out in August of
                    1958 right after I had arrived, Drumright turned to me and he said, “I want a
                    single daily summary of the Chinese press. You do it.” My Chinese was reputed to
                    be very good at that point. I said, “Yes sir.” I sent out word to the
                    supervisors of the translators of what the ambassador said, and then I called in
                    these translators from all these different organizations.</p>
                <p>The translators were all very highly educated Chinese. I believe they were all
                    from the mainland. Many of them were graduates of foreign universities; St.
                    John's in Shanghai and other Western-established universities. Some of them had
                    advanced degrees. Their English was really superb in all cases. I told them
                    first of all what the ambassador's wish was and they all said, “But our press
                    translation is the best one so why don't you turn this over to us?” I said, “No,
                    the ambassador wants this to be an embassy operation and he has directed me to
                    take charge of it.” You must understand that many of these people not only were
                    highly educated but several of them were older than I, and a few were old enough
                    to be my father. This was a very Chinese relationship. I said to them, “But this
                    is what the ambassador wants and we have to cooperate with the ambassador.” They
                    were unhappy with this and they said, “We have to go talk to our chiefs,” and I
                    said, “Of course.”</p>
                <p>They went back and they talked to their chiefs. We were going to have another
                    meeting in a day or two. In the meantime the ambassador was wondering where the
                    hell was this consolidated daily translation of the Chinese press. I kept
                    saying, “We're working on it. It takes a little while to get it organized.”</p>
                <pb facs="0082" n="Page0082"/>
                <p>One of the big problems was, were they all going to be concentrated in one
                    location or not? If so, who was going to be the number one among them because
                    there were four number ones here in this situation and somebody was going to
                    lose face. It all took a great deal of negotiation. We hashed this thing around
                    for a couple of weeks.</p>
                <p>Finally the situation that we hit upon was that the embassy would produce the
                    daily translation of the Chinese press. The Naval Auxiliary Communications
                    Center had the superior publications facility so they would be the publishers of
                    it, but the embassy would be responsible for editing the summary of the daily
                    Chinese press. The translators would continue to identify articles that were
                    important, intrinsically and particularly for the missions of their respective
                    organizations. There would be a morning consultation by telephone among all the
                    chief translators in these respective organizations and we would reach a
                    consensus as to which articles were going to be translated, which group would do
                    each, and then published. All the copy would be relayed to the Naval Auxiliary
                    Communications Center by a certain time so that it could go into the
                    publications operation that they had over there. That is the way we resolved
                    it.</p>
                <p>The other thing was that at one meeting with the translators I said, “Now I would
                    like to conduct our meetings in Chinese.” They all looked at me and said, “But
                    our English is better than your Chinese.” I said, “That's right it is, but I've
                    worked very hard to learn Chinese and if I don't use it, it is not going to get
                    better. It is going to deteriorate.” They insisted that we should work in
                    English because that would be more convenient for me. I said, “Well, if we work
                    in Chinese it is more convenient for you.” “Yes, but your Chinese is not up to
                    our English.” We discussed this back and forth also and we decided not to try to
                    resolve it on the spot.</p>
                <p>Eventually the resolution of that was that when it became convenient for us to
                    work in Chinese, we would work in Chinese. When it became convenient for us to
                    work in English, we would work in English. There was really no formal decision
                    to go one way or the other but each of us would respect the sensitivities and
                    wishes of the other parties. That was very good for me because then I was able
                    to spend about 40 to 60 percent of my working day working in Chinese with the
                    interpreters. If we had to go into English we would go into English in order to
                    get the point across, but I would learn and they would learn. It became a mutual
                    exchange, very professional. My Chinese benefited a great deal from it. And I
                    believe that we all developed a close personal and professional relationship
                    based on mutual respect. We produce an excellent publication, one that all the
                    users regarded highly and of which the translators and I were proud. It was a
                    first class operation and the Ambassador was pleased with it. Nearly all the
                    complaints we ever got were when some breakdown made the summary late in
                    reaching the reporting officers. Those instances were rare. We were proud of
                    meeting our deadlines.</p>
                <pb facs="0083" n="Page0083"/>
                <p>For three years I scanned every day eight Chinese newspapers selecting articles
                    for translation, and we would put them through this system. It worked very well,
                    in fact so well that by the time Vice President Johnson arrived almost three
                    years after it went into operation, we were able to turn out this 30-page
                    edition in which his aides found a potentially offensive article. I don't think
                    it was offensive.</p>
                <p>Q: You mentioned Bill about the visit of Eisenhower. This was the trip he made
                    where things didn't go right in Japan and all. Could you talk about that?</p>
                <p>CUNNINGHAM: That was October of 1960 and Eisenhower came. By that time things had
                    improved a good deal in the overall China situation. That is to say the every
                    other day bombardment of Quemoy was taking place; just a few shells a day. By
                    that time they may have even been down to a point of firing propaganda shells
                    only. In any case Americans were visiting Quemoy regularly and within any fear
                    of danger. It was not exactly a tourist stop but a routine visit spot for
                    visiting congressmen and people like that.</p>
                <p>Economic conditions in Taiwan had also begun to improve by then, very, very
                    modestly I must say because the standard of living was still quite low in 1960.
                    Taiwan was beginning to develop export trade zones and there was beginning to be
                    a little bit of improvement in the living standards of the middle class. People
                    were kind of settling in.</p>
                <p>It was also pretty much accepted by that time that while the government would
                    continue to talk about recovering the mainland and eliminating the bandit regime
                    in Beijing, it wasn't going to do anything militarily. While it would maintain a
                    very strong military force, the military force would have a defensive
                    configuration and not an offensive configuration.</p>
                <p>At that time we were also having regular conversations in Warsaw with the PRC;
                    the ambassadorial level private talks were taking place. The war in Vietnam had
                    not really begun, had not really heated up at that time. There was no fighting
                    in Korea; the DMZ was stabilized. In general there was an atmosphere of
                    well-being and peace in most of Asia. The main issue at that time, which is
                    somebody else's responsibility to talk about, was the revision of the security
                    treaty with Japan which of course led to the failure of Eisenhower's visit
                    there; it didn't take place.</p>
                <p>Eisenhower arrived in Taiwan; it was to be his next to last stop before the
                    planned visit to Japan. It had been programmed as part of the trip. It was very
                    important. A sitting United States president had never before visited any
                    government of China. The highest ranking sitting U.S. official ever to visit a
                    government of China had been Henry Wallace who visited Chung-king in the 1940s
                    while still Vice-President in Roosevelt's third administration. We might note
                    parenthetically that Ulysses S. Grant visited China after leaving office, so he
                    technically was the first U.S. President to visit China, though not a sitting
                    President at the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0084" n="Page0084"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: His round the world trip.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNNINGHAM: Yes. Roosevelt sent Wallace out to find out what was going on out
                    there and to try to keep the Nationalists in the war against the Japanese.</p>
                <p>Eisenhower's trip was a very big deal. Of course Eisenhower was very well liked
                    and respected in Taiwan. I am sure there were things of some substance that took
                    place on that visit but it was largely symbolic. After all Eisenhower had less
                    than a year to go in office and he was too prudent a man to make any long-range
                    commitments for the United States.</p>
                <p>The whole thing was an opportunity for the Republic of China to show itself off
                    internationally. There was a big international and American press corps
                    following Eisenhower. There was very heavy coverage. There were parades and
                    there were rallies. It was all very friendly. And the weather was excellent for
                    all the outdoor activities of the visit. Eisenhower laid a wreath at the tomb of
                    the unknowns, or the war heroes in Taiwan. Someone remarked to me, one of our
                    Chinese staff from the American embassy, said, “Well this is a great show. It is
                    two old soldiers getting together and kind of carrying off the ceremonial
                    functions in that manner.”</p>
                <p>Eisenhower helicoptered in from a cruiser - I think it was the Helena that he was
                    traveling on at the timfrom off the East Coast of Taiwan. The Helena did not
                    come up the Taiwan Straits. It stayed well clear of any provocation of the PRC.
                    I think that looking back this was after all only two years after the
                    bombardment across the Taiwan Straits so there were great pains taken to
                    reassure the PRC that while this was a visit of solidarity, it was not meant as
                    a provocation to the People's Republic of China. I don't remember anything in
                    particular of substance in the case of that visit. It proved useful as a dress
                    rehearsal for Lyndon Johnson's visit the following May when he came through
                    Taiwan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did that one go? By that time he was vice
                        president.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNNINGHAM: By that time Johnson was vice president. He was sent out by Kennedy
                    in April or May to find out what was going on in Vietnam because by '61 the
                    situation was beginning to deteriorate somewhat there. Johnson came out and came
                    to Taiwan. He did not go to Japan because the whole business of the failure of
                    Eisenhower's visit was still too tender for him to risk that. He came to Taiwan.
                    I think it was his first stop in Asia because then he went to the Philippines,
                    Vietnam, and someplace else in Southeast Asia, probably Bangkok, which would
                    have been a logical stop with Thailand being a SEATO ally at the time. I've
                    forgotten what the rest of the itinerary was.</p>
                <pb facs="0085" n="Page0085"/>
                <p>By the time that Johnson arrived, I had begun my duties as Director of the
                    language school in Taichung. I had not moved my family to Taichung yet, and this
                    was fortunate. Drumright called me back to Taipei to serve as Johnson's
                    interpreter on the trip and also to coordinate special editions of the summary
                    of translations of the daily Chinese press coverage of Johnson's visit. Because
                    three years previously at the time of the Taiwan Strait crisis I had set up the
                    daily translation of the local Chinese press at Drumright's direction I knew all
                    these translators, the whole operation. I had run it for three years and this
                    was kind of the final act. We ran an expanded version of some 30 pages or
                    so.</p>
                <p>This visit was quite unlike the Eisenhower's sedate, formal program. Johnson
                    arrived in his campaign style, and he wanted to press the flesh with everybody.
                    It was a very hot day. I was at the airport when he arrived.</p>
                <p>One of the first things that happened involved the first edition of our special
                    translation summary. The Johnson party, the Secret Service, took over the Grand
                    Hotel, which was the only respectable hotel in town at the time, for the vice
                    presidential party. Because Johnson arrived on somewhat short notice, that meant
                    that the reservations of several other people, who had been booked into the
                    hotel, had to be canceled. We were told to cover everything in the press
                    summary, and every article that was related to Lyndon Johnson. Everything. Those
                    were the orders that came down so I passed the word along to the translation
                    staff. They loyally gathered up everything and they translated it.</p>
                <p>Our initial edition of these translations, the arrival one you might say, we
                    included a little article that some enterprising reporter from one of the six
                    Chinese newspapers in Taipei had written concerning his interview with American
                    visitors who were asked to vacate their rooms in the Grand Hotel for Lyndon
                    Johnson. While they grumbled a little bit about it, one of them saiand this was
                    highlighted in the story “Well after all he is the vice president and this is an
                    important visit. I guess as American citizens it's inconvenient for us but we
                    ought to give way for the vice president of the United States.” This article
                    appeared on the last page or the next to last page of this multi-page edition
                    which came off the press just a couple of hours before Johnson was going to
                    touch down. Before it was printed, the senior editor, Donald Wu, called the
                    article to my attention and asked whether it should be included. In light of the
                    orders we had received, I decided we should go with it. Donald, who was a
                    veteran journalist, I suppose told the publications staff to bury the article in
                    the back of the edition.</p>
                <pb facs="0086" n="Page0086"/>
                <p>We rushed 30 or more copies of this edition out to the airport and somebody on
                    the staff made sure that there was at least one copy in every vehicle in the
                    presidential motorcade. Somebody on Johnson's staff looked through this
                    translation edition and found this article on the next to last page. A howl went
                    up and they said, “Oh my god, Lyndon will go through the roof if he sees this.
                    Retrieve all of those. Get them out of there. Get them out of the vehicles.”
                    Somebody else had to run around and gather all these things up and get them out
                    of the motorcade. I think despite this desperate precaution some newspaper guy
                    who was in the traveling party got a hold of one copy and put the story on the
                    international press wires so it was played back to the U.S. press.</p>
                <p>At some point in the visit or before everybody who was accompanying Lyndon
                    Johnson had finally left, one of the Johnson retinue went to see Joseph Yager,
                    the deputy chief of mission at the time, and upbraided him for including this
                    article in the press summary. “Why did you do this?” and so on. Joe Yager looked
                    this thing over and he said, “After all it was published and it wasn't
                    uncomplimentary to the vice president. I think we did the right thing by putting
                    it in.” The matter stopped right there. There was no further consequence after
                    that. My career did not end at that point, thanks to Joe Yager, who was one of
                    the best bosses I ever had.</p>
                <p>As head of the translation section, the guy in charge of translation, there were
                    three other things that happened. I was told to arrange for the translation into
                    Chinese of the joint communiqu� to be issued at the end of Johnson's visit.
                    Johnson was in Taiwan about 36 hours as I recall. The night before the day that
                    he was to leave I went up to the Grand Hotel and started asking around, “Where
                    is the text of the joint communiqu�?” I was told it was up there some place. I
                    looked around, and looked around, and finally somebody said, “Well, Horace
                    Busby, Johnson's speech writer, is up there and he's got it.”</p>
                <p>I went up and found Busby in his room at the Grand Hotel, which had been turned
                    into kind of a workshop at that point with half a dozen people sitting around,
                    going in and out. Busby was sitting there under a lamp with his typewriter,
                    which was not electric as I recall, typing away at something. I said, “I'm here
                    to get the joint communiqu�.” He said, “It's not ready yet. You just wait.” So I
                    sat down and waited. This was about 9:00 at night. I waited while Busby was
                    working on other things.</p>
                <p>Finally he pulled out a piece of paper and came to me and said, “I'm working on
                    this speech that the vice president is going to give tomorrow at 2:00 in the
                    afternoon to the youth rally,” or something like that, “why don't you look it
                    over?” I looked it over. I read the speech and thought, I don't know how this is
                    going to go down. I was supposed to interpret for the vice president at the
                    speech too so I had to know this text. Lyndon Johnson, now that I've been to
                    Texas and know more about his personal background, carried on at great length
                    about how poor the people in Taiwan had been and how much better their life had
                    become. He talked about “you didn't have this, and you didn't have that, and you
                    didn't even have shoes!”</p>
                <pb facs="0087" n="Page0087"/>
                <p>I thought this particular line, “you didn't even have shoes,” was not going to
                    wash to the audience that he's going to be talking to because the Chinese have
                    got a thing about shoes and feet and so on, the whole bound foot syndrome.
                    Lyndon Johnson was simply not attuned to the sensitivities of Chinese culture,
                    so I just deleted that sentence from the text without saying anything. I just
                    crossed it out so that it wouldn't get translated into Chinese. I think I gave
                    it back to Busby but I'm not sure. I believe we handled the translation of that
                    text into Chinese also, so perhaps I just sent it downtown to my staff. It did
                    not appear in the text that the vice president used nor was it in the version
                    published in the Chinese press, I know that.</p>
                <p>The second thing that happened was along about 2:00 in the morning I was still
                    sitting there wondering where this joint communiqu� was. I kept calling my
                    translators saying, “Don't let anybody go home because I haven't got it yet.
                    Make sure somebody is there because I am going to bring it down. The deadline is
                    very short and we are going to have to get it out, press lines and all the
                    rest.”</p>
                <p>Bill Crockett who was undersecretary of State for administration at the time, or
                    deputy undersecretary of State, a high-ranking official, had come in from the
                    state dinner about ten thirty or eleven p.m. and had fallen asleep sitting in a
                    chair, still in his dinner jacket, just about two seats from me in the room
                    there. He had a piece of paper in his hand when he fell asleep. I didn't pay
                    much attention to it. At 2:00 or 3:00 in the morning, Busby got up from his
                    typewriter, walked over, took the piece of paper out of Crockett's hand
                    (Crockett was sound asleep and didn't know this had happened at all.), gave it
                    to me and said, “Here is the joint communiqu�. I guess you had better go get it
                    translated.” I said, “Fine. Thanks very much,” and off I went. Only much later
                    did I realize that I had the only existing copy of the joint communiqu�. I have
                    no idea how it got into the room or why it had been given to Crockett. He surely
                    was not the appropriate member of the party to review it.</p>
                <p>Downtown I went to where my translators were and I said, “Okay, here it is.
                    Translate this thing and get it out. Let me know when it is finished and I'll
                    get a copy of it and get it back to wherever it is supposed to go.” I wasn't
                    given any instructions about this by Busby. I wasn't told to bring it back to
                    him. Busby just said here it is, go get it translated, so off I went. Anyway,
                    then I went home. It was getting toward dawn by this time. I had a shower. I was
                    going to have other things to do. I was going to have to interpret for Johnson
                    later in the day. I didn't even get to bed. I went home, had a shower, and had
                    something to eat.</p>
                <p>About 7:00 in the morning the telephone rang and it was Joe Yager, the deputy
                    chief of mission. He said, “The vice president wants the joint communiqu� and I
                    understand that you've got it.” I said, “Yes, Busby gave it to me and said go
                    get it translated. I've taken it down and they have it and are translating it.”
                    Yager said, “The vice president wants the joint communiqu�.” I said, “Okay,
                    we'll get it up to him.” By that time fortunately there were photocopy machines,
                    Xerox, so we could make a copy of it.</p>
                <pb facs="0088" n="Page0088"/>
                <p>Physically the joint communiqu� was in downtown Taipei at the USIS press office
                    where all the translators were and the vice president was 45 minutes away at the
                    residence of the president, the Gimo, up on Grass Mountain east of town. I said,
                    “Okay.” I called up my head translator and I said, “Photocopy that thing. Get a
                    driver, send it out to Mr. Yager at the president's residence in Tien Mu, and
                    make sure it is delivered to him.” I thought it would all be okay, and I resumed
                    my breakfast.</p>
                <p>Ten minutes later the phone rang again. It was Joe Yager again. “The vice
                    president wants to know where the hell the communiqu� is.” This was obviously a
                    direct quote, because Joe Yager was not given to hard language, especially when
                    dealing with his staff. I said, “It's been copied. I've given instructions and
                    it is on its way. You guys are 45 minutes away. It will get there in due
                    course.” I got three more calls I think before that thing finally arrived, and I
                    assumed the vice president was satisfied.</p>
                <p>There is a follow-on to this. My assumption was incorrect. Johnson was upset and
                    stayed that way. Three years later Lyndon Johnson became president of the United
                    States as a result of Kennedy's assassination. By then I was working on the
                    Republic of China desk in the Department of State. My boss at that time, Paul
                    Popple, now deceased, my neighbor and friend from my days in Saigon and
                    Taichung. Paul had been on Lyndon Johnson's staff when he was a senator, and
                    when Johnson became president he gathered up as many of his former staff members
                    as possible to join the White House staff. He wanted Paul to handle his
                    correspondence, so Popple did.</p>
                <p>After Paul had been there a couple of months he said to me, “Bill, the president
                    keeps talking about this mishandling of the joint communiqu� in Taiwan. What is
                    this all about? You were there.” I said, “Paul, let me tell you, this is what
                    happened.” He said, “The president keeps inquiring about that and he is
                    determined to find out who was the bastard that STOLE,” and those were Johnson's
                    words “the communiqu� in Taipei.” For the rest of the time that I worked in
                    Washington I feared that the next telephone call was going to be Lyndon Johnson
                    on the line saying, “You bastard I've found you now!” From time to time I would
                    hear this feedback that Johnson was still looking for the guy who stole the
                    communiqu�; and he never found me thank God. It says something about his ability
                    to retain the tiniest details and the way in which he reacted to things when
                    they didn't go as he wanted.</p>
                <p>There were two more things that happened on that visit. The afternoon that
                    Johnson arrived after we got him to the hotel I was to escort him. We were to
                    take him down island to a nearby town where the headquarters of the Joint
                    Commission on Rural Reconstruction was located. They had a big display hall
                    there. This was a joint U.S.-ROC organization set up to bring about the
                    improvement of agricultural methods - crop methods, improvement of livestock,
                    and all that sort of thing - in Taiwan. It worked very well. It was very
                    effective. It was one of the best organizations that we ever set up under the
                    mutual assistance program.</p>
                <pb facs="0089" n="Page0089"/>
                <p>I had scoped out the place a couple of days ahead of time, or a week or so ahead
                    of time, and I knew the whole lay of the land. I had been there with the advance
                    party and knew what the vice president was going to do, and so on. We arrived in
                    the town. Johnson leapt out of the car, started working the rope line, and
                    shaking hands with people. I was alongside of him interpreting for him.</p>
                <p>The first thing, he said to some young woman who was there, a high school girl,
                    “How do you get along?” What he meant was how do you survive here, what is your
                    livelihood, and that sort of thing? I tried to interpret that for him and he was
                    firing questions right and left. The girl said, “We don't do anything.” I
                    interpreted that back to him and he couldn't quite grasp that. It was sort of a
                    non-conversation but he was trying to be friendly. His style was so aggressive
                    in the way that he approached people that it put all of the Chinese on their
                    guard just automatically. He was eager to show that he was pressing the flesh
                    campaign style and I could see immediately this chemistry was not working.</p>
                <p>We then started up towards the exhibition hall where the director and staff were
                    waiting to show him what the Joint Commission of Rural Reconstruction had
                    accomplished. The crowd was lining the streets and the Chinese police officers
                    were shouting to everybody, “now don't move; stay where you are.” They didn't
                    want any spontaneous demonstrations there. Johnson looked at this big street
                    with people lined up on both sides and he turned around and said, “You all come
                    on!” as he headed up. The Chinese police immediately began shouting, “Don't
                    move! Don't move!” in Chinese. Johnson turned to me and said, “Why won't they
                    all come along?” I said, “Well, they are being very polite,” not trying to tell
                    him that the police were telling them to stay put. He said, “Well, how do you
                    tell them to come on?” I said, “You say lai, lai.” So he started shouting, “Lai,
                    lai.” The Chinese police began shouting even more loudly, “Don't move! Don't
                    move! Stay in your places!” I could see what was going on so I said, “We had
                    better hurry up there Mr. Vice President and get into the exhibition hall
                    because they are waiting there.”</p>
                <p>We went through this exhibition hall with Johnson firing questions, me
                    interpreting. The poor guy who was supposed to explain everything to him was
                    absolutely petrified by the whole experience and was attempting to respond, I
                    was interpreting. It got done, let's put it that way. I'm not sure that the vice
                    president learned anything from it. I think that the poor guy in charge of the
                    exhibition hall went home, went to bed, and had a drink immediately after it was
                    all over because it was such an overpowering experience. That was the second
                    thing that happened.</p>
                <pb facs="0090" n="Page0090"/>
                <p>The last thing that happened was that when it came to 3:00 the following
                    afternoon, time for Johnson to make this big speech which I was supposed to
                    interpret, Drumright looked at me, looked at the speech, and said, “I think we
                    had better get Commander Wei to do this.” I was a bit crestfallen at the time
                    because I had been preparing very hard to interpret for the president. I think
                    Drumright made the right decision at that point because although my Chinese was
                    very good - I was a four-four on the FSI system at that poinit would have been a
                    challenge to interpret for Johnson, a very difficult challenge as a matter of
                    fact because his style was so colloquial. I think that Drumright made the right
                    decision.</p>
                <p>It is always best in interpreting to be going into the native language of the
                    interpreter. That is to have someone interpreting into his or her native
                    language rather than into a foreign language. I feel strongly about our people,
                    particularly in dealings with the Chinese, having their own interpreters present
                    but I think in retrospect that Drumright was wise. I was tired by that point and
                    I think he understood the kind of stress. I think Drumright was also kind of
                    stressed from dealing with this vice president, this Texas original so-to-speak.
                    Commander Way did a splendid job. He was well known. He had been educated in the
                    United States, and all the rest. He carried it off and gave it the right kind of
                    flair for the audience and the people who were there.I don't think again that
                    anything of political importance other than the symbolism of Johnson's visit
                    occurred at that time. I don't think that he made any particularly important
                    substantive statements in the course of his visit. Everybody was very much
                    relieved when it was all over because it was kind of a whirlwind trauma.</p>
                <p>I was the first guy to experience Lyndon as an interpreter on the trip. The
                    stories that came back from all the people who had the responsibility in other
                    countries down the line, very much reflected the kind of experience that I had
                    with Lyndon Johnson. It contrasted with the Eisenhower trip in the sense that
                    the Eisenhower trip was very well organized, very smooth, there were no
                    incidents of mix-ups over joint communiqu�s. It ran in a very orderly and
                    disciplined fashion whereas the Johnson trip was kind of serendipitous. We were
                    fortunate in the sense that Eisenhower had come there only six to eight months
                    previously because as I say it was a dress rehearsal for what we had to do for
                    Lyndon Johnson.</p>
                <p>The other thing that happened during my assignment in Taiwan was the suppression
                    of the China Democratic Party. I was the first Taiwanese language officer in the
                    embassy. The regimen at the language school in Taichung was to take two years of
                    Mandarin language instruction after having an initial six months in Washington.
                    I knew by the spring on 1958 that I was going to be assigned to the American
                    embassy in Taipei. I asked to be assigned there as a matter of fact. The
                    political counselor was David Osborn, with whom I had worked in Japan and who
                    had been responsible for me starting Chinese language studies. I went to him and
                    I asked for an assignment there, and that was arranged.</p>
                <pb facs="0091" n="Page0091"/>
                <p>My reason for asking for that was I wanted to continue to develop my Chinese. I
                    had learned by then that the officers who were sent to Hong Kong worked mostly
                    in English. Hong Kong was mostly a Cantonese-speaking city in the 1950s, not a
                    Mandarin-speaking city, and the language officers assigned there didn't have
                    very much opportunity for the use of the spoken language. Their facility in the
                    spoken language would gradually begin to deteriorate the longer they stayed in
                    the consulate general. They relieved very heavily on the translation staff there
                    so they didn't work in the written language a great deal of time either.</p>
                <p>That wasn't really what I wanted to do. I wanted to be more a part of the local
                    scene. I may have been influenced somewhat by my earlier experience in Southeast
                    Asia, where - particularly in Cambodia - I had become accustomed to getting
                    around in the local community and associating with the people. The thinking
                    among many of my colleagues at that time was that someday the mainland was going
                    to open up and if we go to Hong Kong we are going to be right into what is going
                    on in the PRC, in the big China, and this was a way of preparing for that
                    experience. I acknowledged certainly the importance of that argument and also
                    the importance of learning about the PRC from a professional standpoint, but I
                    was attracted more to the experience of Chinese culture in so far as I would be
                    able to participate in it in Taiwan, and it looked to me like that was a better
                    chance. So that was why I asked to be assigned to Taipei.</p>
                <p>The second thing was that I knew that when I went there I was going to have to
                    cover what was called domestic politics, which meant opposition politics, which
                    meant Taiwan politics. I thought I ought to learn Taiwanese in order to be
                    effective as a reporter and an analyst on domestic Taiwan affairs. For the last
                    three months that I was in the language school I devoted my study to Taiwanese.
                    The last month that I was there I went down to a little town on the west coast
                    of Taiwan, a place called Lukang. Lukang had been one of the earliest ports on
                    Taiwan settled by people coming across from the mainland in the 17th century.
                    The Taiwanese there was said to be of the purest sort, so I went to live down
                    there for a month in order to immerse myself in that. My Taiwanese was never as
                    fluent as was my Mandarin and I relied much more on my Mandarin for my work in
                    Taiwan than on Taiwanese, but the knowledge that I had of Taiwanese represented
                    something to the Taiwanese people in Taiwan, the natives of Taiwan. It served as
                    an icebreaker for me to establish relationships in my reporting responsibilities
                    in the next three years that I was in the embassy.</p>
                <p>The thing that I want to mention at this point is - and it is important for what
                    is going on right now in 199when I was in Lukang one man I met was a man who was
                    the secretary general, that is to say the chief aide, to a man by the name of
                    Koo Hsien jung. I've forgotten the gentleman's name now though I probably have
                    it someplace in my files. Koo Hsien jung was a very wealthy Taiwanese who had
                    prospered during the Japanese occupation. He had owned lots of sugar plantations
                    and other things in Taiwan. His principal residence, his manor you might say,
                    was in Lukang. He was a native of that town.</p>
                <pb facs="0092" n="Page0092"/>
                <p>This gentleman whom I met took me out there one time and took me through this
                    house, which dated back to sometime in the 1930s. It was one of those houses
                    that was representative of the Asian, and principally the Japanese, taste in
                    European style furnishings, decorations, home design, and all that sort of
                    thing. It was a very elegant house with very nice things in it. It was a little
                    bit run down at that point but still you could see that there was a great deal
                    of class and wealth in this house.</p>
                <p>When the Japanese arrived in Taiwan in 1895 after acquiring it as a result of the
                    Treaty of Shimonoseki that ended the Sino-Japanese war, Koo Hsien jung was one
                    of the Taiwanese collaborators with the Japanese. He had helped guide them in
                    finding their way, so to speak. He was the pathfinder, that's how it was
                    described to me, for the Japanese. He of course prospered and profited greatly
                    in the economic sense from that association with the Japanese during all that
                    period of time.</p>
                <p>He had four sons and one of them was a man by the name of Koo Chen fu. Koo Chen
                    fu was the one who remained in Taiwan; the other three brothers went overseas.
                    Koo Chen fu had had a Japanese education. He is fluent in Japanese. I think the
                    other sons probably had a Japanese education also in Japan at Tokyo Imperial
                    University. Koo Chen fu was also fluent in English. He had very good, very
                    polished English.</p>
                <p>In the 1960s Koo Chen fu was president of the Taiwan Cement Corporation. It was a
                    government corporation in which landowners had been given stock during the land
                    reform program in exchange for the surrender of their lands in Taiwan so that
                    land could be distributed to those who were actually tilling the land. The Koo
                    family lands were exchanged for this stock, and as a consequence of the large
                    holding he acquired in Taiwan Cement Corporation, Koo Chen fu became general
                    manager of the Corporation.</p>
                <p>I also knew Koo Chen fu through the Taipei West Rotary Club. There were five
                    Rotary Clubs in Taipei. As you know Rotary always invites local diplomatic
                    officials to become members. The Taipei West Rotary Club was the
                    Taiwanese-speaking Rotary Club. The other four were Mandarin-speaking Rotary
                    Clubs. There was east, north, south, central and west. All the members of the
                    Taipei West Rotary Club were Taiwanese-speaking. Since I was attempting to
                    cultivate the Taiwanese community as a Taiwanese language officer at the
                    embassy, I joined that club and they very much welcomed me there. Koo Chen fu
                    was a prominent member of the club.</p>
                <pb facs="0093" n="Page0093"/>
                <p>What was very interesting was whenever he made a trip to Japan, which he visited
                    frequently in a business capacity, he would come back and he would report on his
                    trip to the members of the Taipei West Rotary Club. He would do this also when
                    he went sometimes to Hong Kong or sometimes to Korea, or other places. He would
                    come back and make a report to our club, which used to meet on Saturdays at
                    noontime. He was always listened to with very great respect. He was identified
                    in the Taiwanese community as somebody who was a prominent Taiwanese with very
                    close ties to the KMT, the Kuomintang - I think he is probably a Kuomintang
                    member, as a matter of fact, and had beebut also with close ties to the Japanese
                    establish, particularly the conservative wing of the Liberal Democratic Party,
                    the wing of Nobusuke Kishi and Eisaku Sato, two prominent post-war prime
                    ministers. He had good access to those people and with the leadership of the
                    KMT, and to the prominent figures in the Taiwan opposition, not the independence
                    movement but the opposition movement, the non-KMT, or what they called the
                    non-party party. He is a very smart man. I got to know him well and interviewed
                    him. He has become an extremely successful financier in Taiwan.</p>
                <p>Koo is now the chairman of the Straits Exchange Foundation in Taiwan, the private
                    organization set up to conduct the talks with the Association for Relations
                    across the Taiwan Straits. The SEF is closely affiliated with the Mainland
                    Affairs Council, a government organ with a mission comparable to that of the
                    SEF. It is Koo who visited the PRC in his capacity as SEF chairman last fall. He
                    called on President Jiang Zemin in Beijing and told him he really ought to learn
                    more about democratic systems if he wants to understand how things are going in
                    Taiwan these days. Koo has also represented Taiwan as two or three APEC heads of
                    government meetings.</p>
                <p>I think this family history is extremely interesting. I don't think that this is
                    widely known at all. I think that I am one of the very few people who know. I am
                    sure that there are many Taiwanese who know Koo Chen fu's background. It is
                    public knowledge privately kept in Taiwan. It is very interesting that someone
                    whose father was the chief collaborator with the Japanese and helped them
                    establish themselves in Taiwan, now has become designated by the Kuomintang as a
                    principal go-between in their negotiations with the PRC. I think that his
                    position gives him a great deal of resonance among older group of the Taiwanese
                    community although I don't know about the present active generation.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your feeling with this non-party party at that

                <pb facs="0094" n="Page0094"/>
                <p>CUNNINGHAM: First of all I got to know many of the political leaders in various
                    parts of Taiwan and in Taipei also. I was introduced to them in some instances
                    by my chief, David Osborn, who had known them when he served in Taipei earlier.
                    I was also introduced by some of the CIA people. My job was, first of all, to be
                    in touch with them so they would feel that their views were known in the
                    American embassy and known to the U.S. Department of State, the American
                    diplomatic establishment. My job was not to encourage them in any way in their
                    political ambitions.</p>
                <p>Now there were splits among them. Some of them of course were very plainly in
                    favor of making Taiwan an independent country and displacing the Kuomintang rule
                    there. They were in effect anti-Kuomintang, but they could not say so publicly.
                    Many of them were very skillful in criticizing policies of the Kuomintang and of
                    the Nationalist government, and at expressing their disaffections without going
                    so far as to expose themselves to the charge of treason.</p>
                <p>In the 1950s a gentleman by the name of Lei Chen, who was a publisher and
                    journalist, established a weekly newsmagazine in Taipei called Free China, Tsu
                    Yu Chung Kuo. This magazine was a vocal and open critic of the Kuomintang and
                    the Nationalist government. It was very well written and edited and highly
                    regarded for its literary quality and journalistic quality. It was widely read
                    by the intelligencia in Taipei and in Taiwan, as well as by the people who were
                    not members of the Kuomintang and who were critical of Kuomintang rule. The
                    magazine reflected their views. It was a considerable irritant to the Kuomintang
                    and most especially to Chiang Kai-shek.</p>
                <p>I never met Lei Chen. Lei Chen was a vocal critic, an avowed critic of the
                    Kuomintang and he did not hesitate to make his disaffection known. What he was
                    criticizing was the inconsistencies of policies of the Kuomintang, particularly
                    the limitations upon personal freedoms that were guaranteed to people in the
                    constitution under the martial law conditions in Taiwan at the time.</p>
                <p>In 1959 soon after the Taiwan Strait crisis had moderated, Lei Chen became active
                    in the formation of an opposition political party called the China Democratic
                    Party, Tsu Yu Min Chu Tang I think it was called. In effect Tsu Yu Chung Kuo,
                    his journal, became the organ of the nascent political movement. I think in fact
                    they actually attempted to register the party or maybe they even did register it
                    as a legal party in China. It showed signs of becoming a very powerful party.
                    That is to say it would be a party that would have a mainlander leadership,
                    non-KMT leadership, of people like Lei Chen or other intelligencia and the very
                    few opposition politicians of a mainlander nature that there were in Taiwan at
                    the time, and a very large Taiwanese constituency. By large I mean running in to
                    the hundreds of thousands. It would have a considerable following among those
                    who identified themselves as the “non-party party,” which was pretty evident
                    soon after it got going. That was very alarming to the KMT and also particularly
                    to the Gimo.</p>
                <pb facs="0095" n="Page0095"/>
                <p>The formation of this party coincided also with a constitutional crisis in
                    Taiwan. The KMT was operating under the 1947 constitution that had been adopted
                    in China in a popular referendum carried out through most of China, and with
                    officials elected to public office under that constitution at that time who had
                    traveled to Taiwan with the Gimo. In effect they used to say, they were
                    following the practice of the Long Parliament of the reign of Charles the II and
                    Oliver Cromwell, although the KMT did not follow policies comparable to those of
                    the Long Parliament.</p>
                <p>The KMT held that it had been elected constitutionally to office. It was not
                    possible for the Government to hold elections in the territory of China. The
                    constitution, adopted by referendum in 1947, said that elected officials shall
                    continue in office until duly elected representatives are able to take office.
                    Well you couldn't have elections, so nobody could be elected to take their
                    office, so therefore they continued in office and that was the logic that they
                    were using.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And everyone in it was quite happy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNNINGHAM: Everyone in office was quite happy with that. However, under the
                    terms of the constitution the president was limited to two terms and his term
                    was expiring in 1960. The question came to be, what can we do about this
                    situation? It was inconceivable, most particularly to the Gimo, that anyone else
                    could be president at that time. An amendment to the constitution would be
                    required to remove this impediment. The National Assembly, a directly elected
                    body roughly comparable to our Electoral College, had the authority to amend the
                    constitution. But the membership of the National Assemble living in Taiwan or
                    overseas, was less than the quorum specified by the constitution.</p>
                <p>This is all covered in our reporting from the embassy in Taipei by the way. I did
                    much of the reporting on this: how the constitution was “legally” or
                    constitutionally amended despite the lack of a sufficient quorum in the amending
                    body which was the national assembly; how this was done and judged to be legal
                    so that the Gimo could succeed himself for a third term and indefinitely
                    thereafter and in effect become president for life. That was all “handled” at
                    that time. There is reporting to document it so we need not go into that.</p>
                <pb facs="0096" n="Page0096"/>
                <p>The formation of this party came along just at this time when everybody was
                    conscious of the constitutional crisis that was arising and before it had
                    actually been resolved. Needless to say, Free China Magazine and the China
                    Democratic Party were highly critical of this entire procedure and denounced it
                    as another symptom of the undemocratic nature of the KMT regime. In that sense
                    the formation of this party was a politically threatening development to the
                    KMT. Taiwan was not a democratic society in those days, and opposition to its
                    policies or to Chiang Kai-shek was equated with subversion at the behest of the
                    Chinese Communists. It made no difference that the PRC was at the time in the
                    midst of the Great Leap Forward, which was for it a political crisis, and not
                    really in position to interfere directly in the political life of Taiwan. The
                    perception of real opposition was enough to provoke the Gimo's paranoia.The
                    upshot was that Lei Chen was arrested on charges of communist subversion. It
                    happened on a Sunday afternoon, and a friend of mine, Dr. Chang Yen-tien, a U.S.
                    educated professor of agricultural economics at the National Taiwan University,
                    and his wife were visiting us that afternoon for tea. Somehow the radio was
                    tuned in - or perhaps at some point that afternoon the cook came in to tell us -
                    and we heard that Lei Chen had been arrested. My friend, who I believe was a
                    party member, a KMT member, or at least he was not in opposition to the KMT, was
                    absolutely aghast. I can still see his expression when we heard that Lei Chen
                    had been arrested. It just ended the conversation. Nobody said anything more and
                    he and his wife excused themselves shortly after that and went home.</p>
                <p>It had a profound, shocking effect on the intellectual and political class
                    regardless of party in Taiwan at the time. It had been a long time since
                    anything like that had happened under the Gimo and it was a severe warning. I
                    think very quickly the publication of Free China, Tsu Yu Chung-kuo ceased. Maybe
                    it has reappeared since then, but it stopped publishing at that point. That
                    whole intellectual and political community around Lei Chen more or less
                    dissolved and evaporated.</p>
                <pb facs="0097" n="Page0097"/>
                <p>He was taken into custody. As the guy who was doing domestic political reporting
                    it was my responsibility to follow this case and report on it. Lei Chen was
                    tried in a military court. I did about a 50-page report on that trial. It was
                    difficult to do because word came down from Drumright that no one in the
                    embassthough I think it was specially intended for mwas to have any
                    communication at all with Lei Chen's adherents and supporters, and the
                    intellectuals around Lei Chen; there were several particularly at National
                    Taiwan University. I operated under those restrictions but I nevertheless had to
                    find out about the trial. The other officers in the political section, and I
                    think particularly David Osborn the political counselor, in effect tacitly
                    approved of reporting on the case. It was accepted that the case had to be
                    reported and they more or less said, here's what the ambassador says, just be
                    circumspect in the way in which you collect the information.I did not live in an
                    American compound. I had made that decision when I moved to Taipei in 1958. I
                    lived in a Chinese neighborhood. One of my neighbors was a magazine editor. One
                    was a university professor. One was a national assemblyman. One was a police
                    officer. One was a customs official. I had many contacts in the community of
                    that sort. Also, I happened to be living just a short distance from the language
                    program operated at that time by Cornell University under a Ford Foundation
                    grant for American graduate students who were studying Chinese. Most of them
                    were studying Chinese at this school but they had a lot of contact with National
                    Taiwan University and with the faculty and intellectual community out there.</p>
                <p>Relying upon all of these second hand and third hand accounts of what was going
                    on, I was able to put together the details of Lei Chen's trial and the arguments
                    that were going on. Word of mouth communication is wonderful. It operates. It is
                    very reliable in China and you just have to be very scrupulous in collecting all
                    of this and in doing your analysis and comparisons. Also the newspaper Ta Kung
                    Pao, the great public daily which I had mentioned earlier as one of the papers
                    that I scanned every day, somehow or another was able to obtain the transcript
                    of the trial and published it verbatim, which I used then as part of my
                    reporting.</p>
                <p>What it comes down to is this: Lei Chen was convicted of communist subversion
                    upon the testimony of one single government witness who said that he had
                    conveyed a letter from somebody in the PRC to Lei Chen. This contact was
                    sufficient to prove a violation of the martial law decree under which Taiwan
                    operated at that time and which categorically forbade contact of any kind - -
                    direct or indirect - - with the PRC or the CCP. Lei Chen was convicted and sent,
                    I suppose, to Green Island where most political prisoners were imprisoned in
                    those days. He was sentenced to 20 or 25 years. I remember reading of his
                    release, or impending release, many years later, and I think it may have even
                    been after Chiang Kai-shek died. I don't know whether he is still alive or not.
                    That trial was a real kangaroo court, and the verdict really ended the China
                    Democratic Party.</p>
                <pb facs="0098" n="Page0098"/>
                <p>There were a couple of meetings afterwards of the remaining leadership of the
                    party, one in Taipei and one in a place called Feng-Yuan, at that time a remote
                    rural town down in central Taiwan, at the home of one of the movement's leaders.
                    That was an important meeting. I learned through my sources of the people who
                    had been present at that meeting so I went to interview them discretely. They
                    were very reluctant, of course, to talk about any of this at this time. It took
                    a lot of effort on my part to assure them that I would respect their
                    confidences.</p>
                <p>After the suppression, Lei Chen's arrest and conviction, there was a split in the
                    movement. There were actually three components to this split. Taipei was mainly
                    a Mainland Chinese city at that time although the Taiwanese population of Taipei
                    was the majority population, it was about 60-30. But they were not the power
                    holders in Taipei. Those leaders of the movement for the new party who lived in
                    Taipei were very conscious of the pressure of the government. They thought that
                    the suppression made clear that it was time, in effect, to just call off, not to
                    continue to push things, to lie low and wait for a better day, and to more or
                    less keep the structure of the party intact but not to push for any further
                    agitation or activity of any kind. The people in the south, particularly from
                    Tainan southward through Kaohsiung and into Pingtung Prefecture, all of which is
                    heavily Taiwanese, were the ones who said, “No, this is the time we ought to
                    push harder. We ought to really try to push our cause. We think that the arrest
                    of Lei Chen shows the fear of the government, so we shouldn't let up the
                    pressure at this point.” There were some vocal people in that group whom I knew
                    also who were advocates of that, particularly the mayor of Tainan at the time,
                    the Yeh Ting-kuei.</p>
                <p>I did a report also on this meeting and in my analysis after and we labeled these
                    factions the “go-fast” and the “go-slow” sections with the go-slow people being
                    the northerners, so to speak, in the capital, and the go-fast people being the
                    southerners elsewhere. The southerners, the go-fast wing, was egged on by a
                    group known as the Taiwan Independence Movement that was based in Tokyo and led
                    by a man named Thomas Liao. There was a Liao family and three Liao brothers who
                    go back to the uprising against the government in 1947 and who had to go into
                    exile afterwards. There were remnants of that movement in the United States and
                    in Japan still. They were all in favor of course in pushing the independence
                    line. They were out and out for the independence of Taiwan. They were in favor
                    of supporting the go-fast wing, the southern wing, of this new opposition
                    movement.</p>
                <pb facs="0099" n="Page0099"/>
                <p>The northern wing prevailed. It prevailed in part because economic conditions in
                    Taiwan began to improve as a result of the U.S. economic assistance programs and
                    as a result of the policies of the government, which at that point began to
                    shift first of all towards industrial development and offshore manufacturing. In
                    other words it was like what we call the Maquiladora program here in Mexico and
                    in Texas. They were setting up export production zones where the components of
                    foreign products could be brought in, finished, and then shipped out. It would
                    provide employment to excess labor in Taiwan and bring earnings into the local
                    economy but it would not add to the imported consumer goods on the local
                    markets. There were still very heavy duties and restrictions on imports at that
                    time. The infusion of that money into the economy along with the U.S. assistance
                    program provided much of the capital that was necessary to develop Taiwan's
                    economy.</p>
                <p>The other component of this is that at that time in 1960-1961, but particularly
                    in 1960, U.S. economic assistance policy in Taiwan shifted toward encouraging
                    the government to develop a consumer economy. There was a very important speech
                    given by Wesley Haraldson, the head of the AID mission, at what was called the
                    Friends of China Club, one of the other principal hotels in Taipei. It was to a
                    civic group. I don't think it was to a Rotary Club meeting but it was to
                    something like that. It was a forum where Haraldson very strongly advocated the
                    merits and the benefits of a consumer economy and in effect he said, “You've got
                    to develop a consumer economy. You've got to become consumers.”</p>
                <p>His advocacy of that point was very important because it gave encouragement and
                    support to an element within the ROC government at the time that also saw this
                    as the way to improve Taiwan's economic condition and to get away from the sort
                    of situation where you were attempting to develop a garrison state; an austerity
                    economy where you sacrificed everything in order to support a military
                    establishment whose purpose was going to be to recover the mainland. Of course
                    local Taiwanese business people were in favor of this also, and that is where
                    much of the wealth was as a matter of fact; in the hands of the Taiwanese, not
                    in the hands of the mainlanders. It used to be commonly said in those days that
                    the mainlanders have the power and the Taiwanese have the money. There was a
                    great deal of truth to that in that comparison.</p>
                <pb facs="0100" n="Page0100"/>
                <p>We were very fortunate in that time in Taiwan because the leadership in the
                    economic elements of the government, the government organization that was set up
                    to handle U.S. economic assistance, the ministry of Economic Affairs, the
                    finance minister, and so forth, were staffed by people who had been educated at
                    the London School of Economics, Columbia, Harvard, Yale, in Europe, and in
                    various places like that. They were forward thinking. They were Keynesians. They
                    had been exposed to the Keynesian idea of economic development and expansion.
                    Haraldson I think in that sense was a Keynesian also. Philosophically the
                    leadership of our economic assistance mission, our AID mission, and the economic
                    leadership of the ROC government, were in tune with one another. They both were,
                    of course, out of sync with the KMT's political philosophy of austerity and
                    sacrifice, which was of a different order, but these “Keynesians” managed to
                    prevail.</p>
                <p>By the way, Haraldson was also supported by Joseph Yager, the deputy chief of
                    mission. Yager was not a China specialist. He was an economist. He was one of
                    those people who were Wristonized into the Foreign Service in the 1950s. After
                    his service in Taiwan he became the director of East Asian Affairs in the Bureau
                    of Far Eastern Affairs, as it was then called, in the Department of State. Yager
                    and Haraldson were very much both of the same mind as economists as to what the
                    economic future of Taiwan should be. Yager was very much trusted by Drumright. I
                    think that trust between Yager and Drumright was very important in influencing
                    the development of American policy at that point and in helping Taiwan to become
                    an economic powerhouse that it is today.</p>
                <p>We talked at that timand I mentioned it in an earlier tapabout the “takeoff” of
                    the Taiwan economy. Walt Rostow had published his book.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which was a series of indicators, Iraq was one of those
                        ready ttake off.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNNINGHAM: Yes. And Taiwan was identified as an economy that was on the verge of
                    takeoff, by many people, Rostow included, at that point. It is very interesting
                    because a man by the name of Paul Sturm, whom I had known in Vietnam ten years
                    previously and who was an old time Foreign Service officer, was the head of
                    Embassy Taipei's economic section. Sturm had been consul general in Hanoi, as a
                    matter of fact, in the 1950s and then somehow got to Taiwan. He was not a China
                    specialist. He was not an Asia specialist. He was one of those people who was a
                    Europeanist. French was his language; that's how he got to Vietnam. That's the
                    way things worked in the Foreign Service in those days.</p>
                <pb facs="0101" n="Page0101"/>
                <p>I remember very, very clearly in a staff meeting in the embassy conference room
                    in Taipei, a large meeting involving most of the substantive officers at the
                    embassy, chaired by Paul Sturm on the question of Taiwan's economic takeoff.
                    Sturm said very clearly, “I do not see this happening at all. I think that
                    Taiwan's economic takeoff is going to be like the gooney bird on Midway Island.
                    It runs down the runway flapping its wings but never gets airborne.” He made
                    that pronouncement about the fall of 1960 or the spring of 1961. Well, God bless
                    Paul Sturm, rest his soul in peace, but here is Taiwan today one of the “Tiger
                    economies of the 1980s and '90s and one of the few economies that has survived
                    the East Asian economic crisis of the last two years very successfully indeed.
                    They seem to know how to make economic policy out there very, very well.</p>
                <p>Q: I want to go back to the arrest of Lei Chen. Today in the 1990s, or in the
                    1980s even, we would have been all over the Kuomintang government protesting
                    saying this isn't the way to do this. You couldn't have sat still for it. What
                    about at that time, was there any effort or movement at all to say really we
                    should tell Chiang Kai-shek that by doing this he is squelching democracy and
                    that this is a bad thing?</p>
                <p>CUNNINGHAM: I'm glad you asked the question because it reminds me of something
                    that I should have mentioned earlier. I know that it was certainly widely
                    recognized among the Chinese intelligencia that this was an unjust accusation
                    and action. Even for my translators with whom I worked on a daily basis and who
                    helped me a lot with gathering information on this case felt this way. Although
                    it was never explicitly said, they were very quick to point out those things
                    that were clearly unjust about Lei's case, as were other people with whom I came
                    into contact. There was a lot of head shaking among my peers, that is to say
                    second secretaries and so forth in the American embassy, over this thing.</p>
                <p>I think at the time when the trial was either nearing the end or when the verdict
                    had been delivered and sentencing was going to take place, I've forgotten
                    exactly at what point it was, but near the climax of this trial, I sat down and
                    I wrote a short memorandum to David Osborn, the political counselor. (I was
                    second secretary in the embassy at this point) I wrote to the effect tha“We
                    claim to be supporting democracy against totalitarianism and repression all over
                    the world. We claim that this is a democratic state in Taiwan and yet this
                    blatant injustice is taking place.” I don't know if I put it this eloquently and
                    I'm probably embellishing it a bit but the thrust was this, “Very clearly here
                    is this unjust decision. Clearly this has been a rigged trial. It's a kangaroo
                    court. It is a judgment that would not stand up in any court of law. I believe
                    that the American embassy has the obligation to say something to the Chinese
                    government about this and we ought to do something.” My memo wasn't very long;
                    it was just a short paragraph less than a third of a page. It was very clear
                    from all the reporting and all that data as to what was going on.</p>
                <pb facs="0102" n="Page0102"/>
                <p>I wasn't very clear as to what we might do or could do. I remember I typed this
                    up myself on those letterheads that we had at the time for internal office
                    memorandums. I took it up to David's office. A short time later he brought it
                    back to me in my office. That in itself was unusual because I was located in a
                    wing of the embassy building separated from the suite where most of the
                    Political Section was located. David handed the memo back to me and said, “This
                    isn't going to go anywhere. If I send it on through, you know how the ambassador
                    (Drumright at the time) is going to react to this. It is just going to cause a
                    lot of trouble for yourself. I think you ought to pull it back.”</p>
                <p>Drumright had a point of view that simply would not allow any questioning of the
                    conduct of the Nationalist government on points of this kind, or any challenge
                    to them. He just couldn't see that it would lead to anything productive and he
                    couldn't see that there was any U.S. interest in making any objection to that.
                    He really had wanted us to stay far away from this trial and not become involved
                    in it. My reporting on it, which I am happy to say was supported and encouraged
                    by David Osborn and the other officers in the political section, nonetheless had
                    to be very circumspect. That's why I say if you did any reporting it had to be
                    well documented. I worked hard to prepare a thorough, objective, and completely
                    documented report, but I had to gather my information in a very circumspect way
                    and in a way that did not show or indicate any intervention on the part of the
                    United States government into this proceeding. This was one of those sad
                    examples of the reluctance, even resistance, all too frequently in my experience
                    at least to consider analysis, opinion, or views advanced in good faith and in
                    loyalty to our government, but critical, or at least, questioning of our
                    policies.I did take my memo back from Osborn. He was realistic I suppose. I have
                    never been happy about that. I have no doubt as to how Drumright would have
                    reacted if it had gone through. I don't know what would have happened but I felt
                    vulnerable at the time. That statement by Osborn, I don't think that there was a
                    chance that the ambassador would have accepted it. I don't know whether the
                    ambassador would have referred the question to Washington at all. He could have
                    said a member of my staff thinks there is something wrong here and we ought to
                    look into it and maybe say something. I don't think Drumright would have done
                    that. I think Osborn was correct. There wasn't any dissent channel in those days
                    at all. There was no way that a junior officer who thought that somebody in the
                    government ought to have a second look at this, could get that kind of a
                    recommendation through, so there it was.</p>
                <p>A year or two later when I came back to Washington, my colleagues on the desk and
                    I had a chance to talk about it among ourselves. Everybody recognized that this
                    was a rigged trial, it was a trumped up charge, and the verdict was a foregone
                    conclusion. It was entirely political. It was unjust. It couldn't be defended
                    under any terms whatsoever.</p>
                <pb facs="0103" n="Page0103"/>
                <p>Drumright was not highly regarded by the China specialists in the service at the
                    time. They thought that he was overly swayed by the Nationalist's position; that
                    he wasn't able to see what was truly happening in social and political terms in
                    China as a whole; and that he was overly partial to the Nationalist's position.
                    That's a judgment of history. He was certainly well liked by the Nationalists
                    and regarded as somebody who was friendly to their cause. Most of the China
                    specialists did not think that Drumright was realistic in his analysis of the
                    Chinese situation from the American viewpoint.</p>
                <p>Q: This of course is part of the reason why Ambassador Drumright had the
                    reputation of being a hardliner as far as China was concerned, and in a way a
                    bit of a dinosaur.</p>
                <p>CUNNINGHAM: Overly subject to the line of the Kuomintang.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. But it also points out something that maybe he was
                        representing. I've heard it said that when John Kennedy came into office
                        President Eisenhower said to the effect, “I'm going to support you in
                        foreign policy but don't mess with China.” Kennedy came in with a very small
                        majority. He barely made it and it was sort of disputable. It was felt that
                        Kennedy didn't feel that he could fight many battles. The China lobby and
                        all this was just not one of those battles that he was going to fight, and
                        he didn't.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNNINGHAM: Yes, and it's very interesting. We should talk a little bit about
                    that episode because Drumright lost his job soon after Kennedy came into office.
                    Johnson came to Taiwan early in the Kennedy administration, May or June of 1961,
                    and Drumright was the ambassador at that time. Drumright stayed on until about
                    1962.</p>
                <p>Somehow or another it was told to me at the time (and this needs to be
                    investigated) that the administration decided that the right move for us at that
                    time as a way of showing some kind of opening to the PRC, some desire to get
                    through to them, was to recognize Mongolia as an independent country. Donald
                    Zagoria had published his book on the Sino-Soviet split and there was a certain
                    community within Washington who believed that the Soviets and the Chinese were
                    falling apart. This rupture was as a result of the Quemoy bombardment in 1958,
                    of Mao's wish to use nuclear weapons at that time, Khrushchev was horrified by
                    this, and so on. There was some thinking along those lines and the idea of
                    recognizing Mongolia was seen as a way of exploiting this split between Beijing
                    and Moscow. The administration decided that it wanted to recognize Mongolia and
                    this became the first big irritant in the relationship between the Kennedy
                    administration and the Republic of China.</p>

                <p>Everybody in the China business at that time, regardless of political persuasion
                    from Drumright to the most leftist, knew that the quickest way to offend any
                    Chinese is to somehow or another interfere with their claim to sovereignty over
                    part of what is considered sacred Chinese territory. I think by that time, 1961
                    or 1962, the PRC had probably recognized Mongolia and established diplomatic
                    relations with them as a way of gaining access to the international community,
                    but Mongolia at that time was not a widely recognized country at all. I think it
                    was only Soviet bloc countries that maintained diplomatic relations with
                    Mongolia. And the KMT considered it sovereign Chinese territory, and still does
                    today. The latest yearbooks published by the government on Taiwan contain maps
                    showing Mongolia as part of China.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think it was also in the UN.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNNINGHAM: No, I don't think so at that time. Anyhow, so far as the Republic of
                    China was concerned, Mongolia was a Chinese territory and that was certainly
                    true of the entire KMT establishment. There was no sympathy in the Republic of
                    China for the U.S. establishing diplomatic relations with Mongolia. I think the
                    people in the Kennedy administration just did not understand. They were looking
                    at the PRC-USSR relationship and they were thinking only about that. They did
                    not realize the explosiveness of this question in terms of our relationship with
                    Taiwan. Drumright tried to explain this and in that respect I think he had the
                    support of everybody in the embassy because we all- (end of tape)</p>
                <p>Drumright made it pretty clear in his reporting to Washington that this was a
                    no-no. By that time I was director of the language school in Taichung so I was
                    not involved in this. Well you know how it is with new presidents, new
                    administrations, new parties in power, and so forth, they don't really welcome
                    reporting and analysis that is critical of something that they have decided is
                    going to be a leading point of their policies.</p>
                <p>Meantime the ROC ambassador in Washington was George Yeh Kung-chao, a very
                    distinguished man who had been foreign minister. He was a very urbane guy and
                    was very much respected by everybody. He was trying to explain to his
                    government, to Taipei, why the Kennedy administration wanted to do this, what
                    their thinking was, and to recommend ways to them to deal with it.</p>
                <p>I think at one point the vice president of the ROC, Chen Cheng, was sent to
                    Washington to try to explain the situation to Rusk, or Kennedy, or Mac George
                    Bundy, or somebody at this point, “the best and the brightest” of those who were
                    in Washington at that time. Well, they didn't get it. They weren't understanding
                    it at all. Meantime back in Taipei the ROC was not understanding it either.
                    There was a complete mutual non-communication on this whole question.</p>
                <pb facs="0105" n="Page0105"/>
                <p>From the standpoint of Washington, Drumright was doing a lousy job of putting the
                    point across to the ROC. From the standpoint of Taipei, Yeh Kung-chao was doing
                    an equally lousy job of putting the point across to Washington. I think it was
                    one of those situations of what the hell kind of ambassadors are you people if
                    you can't get this across? The problem was that both of them were holdovers from
                    a previous time. Yeh Kung-chao was a holdover from the Eisenhower time in
                    Washington and Drumright was a holdover in Taipei from the Eisenhower time. On
                    the part of both capitals, our ambassadors were not persuasive the way
                    ambassadors were supposed to be; they weren't turning the other party
                    around.</p>
                <p>The first thing that happened was that George Yeh was called back for
                    consultations, presumably for a week. He had this week of consultations in
                    Taipei and then while they thought about that he decided to take a tour of
                    Taiwan and just do a little sightseeing. He came to Taichung and visited the
                    language school. I thought this was a marvelous opportunity for the Chinese
                    ambassador in Washington to talk to these language students. I took him all
                    through the school and showed him around then he talked to the students.</p>
                <p>He did not bring up the question of Mongolia specifically but he said, “You know
                    it is very difficult being a diplomat because the problems that come up for us
                    in diplomacy in many cases are just a lack of communication. My advice to you as
                    diplomatic officers is to work very hard maintaining good communication. If
                    you've got good communication then problems will take care of themselves. It is
                    just a matter of understanding things clearly.” I think what he very clearly had
                    on his mind was that he understood that both sides just weren't getting it and
                    there had been a breakdown in communications between Washington and Taipei on
                    this question.</p>
                <p>It is very poignant because Yeh Kung-chao, to my knowledge, never left Taiwan
                    after being recalled. He was a calligrapher and a bamboo painter, and so as many
                    Chinese gentlemen do, he went into a sort of gentle retirement in Taipei and
                    devoted himself to bamboo painting and calligraphy. Several years later he was
                    made a minister without portfolio of the government but he never went abroad
                    again, even for a short visit. He had offended, or failed, the Gimo, and was
                    thereafter confined to Taiwan. Later he did become a Minister without portfolio
                    in the ROC government, perhaps in the administration of Chiang Ching-kuo.</p>
                <pb facs="0106" n="Page0106"/>
                <p>Almost concurrently Everett Drumright was recalled to Washington. There was a big
                    sendoff for him. One of my colleagues, a man by the name of Sherrod McCall who
                    was a Chinese language officer and who at that time was assigned to the embassy
                    in Taipei as a second secretary in a different capacity from what I had (I think
                    he was deputy chief of the political section) told me about Drumright's
                    departure at the airport when he was leaving for Washington. He said, “Bill, you
                    know Drumright just did not understand what had happened to him. He was
                    uncomprehending of the situation. He was breaking down.” Sherrod was Drumright's
                    principal aide and briefcase carrier. He said, “I had to say to him, 'Mr.
                    Ambassador wipe your nose.' He was becoming very emotional over this thing and
                    he simply didn't get it.” Of course Drumright was recalled and he never came
                    back to Taiwan in an official capacity, although he did make a number of trips
                    there and always was well received. He was replaced as ambassador by Alan Kirk
                    who was a Kennedy prot�g�, so to speak. As a footnote, I recall that some years
                    later Sherrod told me that while serving as Drumright's aide he had a chance to
                    review the files and papers that the ambassador kept for his personal reference.
                    Sherrod remarked on that occasion that he came to see a side of Drumright that
                    the rest of us did not see, and Sherrod remarked, that the insights so gained
                    caused him to “respect and sympathize with Drumright.” Sherrod never said more
                    than that, so I don't know to what he had reference.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It wasn't Admiral Wright? It was Kirk?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNNINGHAM: Admiral Wright succeeded Kirk. It was Alan Kirk. Alan Kirk had been
                    commander of the allied flotilla in the British Channel on D-Day and got to know
                    the Kennedy family in that way. He was long retired. (There is a little more to
                    the Mongolia story too, by the way.) The administration made the judgment that
                    they wanted a senior military officer out there as ambassador to establish
                    communication with the G-Mo. In other words the Gimo would look upon a military
                    officer as a kind of professional peer, not a State Department diplomat. That
                    was the reason for the selection of Kirk. He went out there at some point.</p>
                <p>When I was working in the Bureau of East Asian Affairs later on in the '60s while
                    Harriman was assistant secretary for East Asian Affairs, there was some point at
                    which Kirk questioned one of our policies. I've forgotten exactly what was the
                    question at that point. Harriman blew up and said, “Send Kirk a telegram and
                    tell him it is time to get on board American policy.”</p>
                <pb facs="0107" n="Page0107"/>
                <p>On the Mongolia thing, this question continued to come up throughout the Kennedy
                    administration. It did, by the way, make good policy sense to recognize Mongolia
                    if we wanted to exploit the Sino-Soviet split, once that became clear and was
                    accepted as a reality in Washington. Mongolia was definitely a Soviet satellite,
                    but with the Soviets and the PRC at loggerheads, Ulaanbaatar could have been
                    bolstered somewhat by greater international acceptance. So there was a rational
                    basis, at least in hindsight, for promoting this idea. Recognition of Mongolia
                    would not have helped our relations with the ROC, but it couldn't afford to
                    protest overly, and it would not have been seen by the PRC as an overture from
                    us to a better relationship.</p>
                <p>I remember very well, I think I was working on the Mainland China desk in the
                    later part of the 1960s sometime between 1965 and 1967, and again we revived the
                    question of recognizing Mongolia. Now this was after the Chinese had detonated
                    their nuclear device, after the signing of the partial nuclear test ban treaty
                    in 1963, and after the split between the Soviet Union and the PRC as
                    acknowledged by everyone. Again this issue of recognizing Mongolia arose and we
                    actually sent a fellow by the name of William A. Brown to study Mongolian at the
                    University of Washington where there is a Mongolian language course.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He ended up in London actually.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNNINGHAM: He ended up in London, Israel, and Bangkok, but he nevegot to
                    Mongolia.</p>
                <p>Q: I'm interviewing Bill right now. He ended up translating the Soviet history of
                    Mongolia into Mongolia, I think, from Russian. He was marking time there.</p>
                <p>CUNNINGHAM: I don't think Bill Brown ever set foot in Mongolia,certainly not in
                    active duty and maybe not as a retired officer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I don't think he ever went there. Maybe he has once
                        iretirement.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNNINGHAM: Anyway we had him in training and there was a woman officer who was
                    also in training with him. They were to be the two to be sent to Mongolia. We
                    kept sending memoranda up to Dean Rusk asking what about recognition of
                    Mongolia? Dean Rusk never said no on the question of Mongolia. He always had
                    more questions about this recommendation. He would think up questions and send
                    them down to us for review. We would dig around.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was while you were on the desk?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0108" n="Page0108"/>
                <p>CUNNINGHAM: That's right, as a desk officer. Lindsey Grant I believe was the
                    chief of the Mainland China desk at that time and his deputy was David Dean. You
                    ask both of these guys about this whole thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I've interviewed both of them.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNNINGHAM: Ask them about Mongolia. At any rate we would work this memo up and
                    send it back up to Rusk. I was not responsible for this but it was a small
                    office and I knew what was going on. We would answer Rusk's questions and send
                    it back up. We would hear nothing for a long time. Finally we would call up
                    Rusk's office chief of staff or something and say, “You know that recommendation
                    on Mongolia, where is it?” “It's in his in-box.” “Could you shuffle it up to the
                    top of the in-box?” The guy would shuffle it up to the top of the in-box and
                    first thing you know it would come back again with more questions. I think there
                    were at least three or four rounds of this thing during Rusk's tenure as
                    secretary of State. It never was approved by Rusk. Itnever was disapproved by
                    him; he always had more questions to ask about it. I don't really know what it
                    was that motivated Rusk. In other words why Rusk was not willing to buy into
                    this idea of recognizing Mongolia.</p>
                <p>Bill Brown is one of my good friends who was trained in Mongolian and the other
                    one was Stapleton Roy, now ambassador to Indonesia who also was trained in
                    Mongolian. I've forgotten where he took his training. It may have been the same
                    place. He was supposed to go to Mongolia and he never got there either. Finally
                    the first ambassador of the United States to Mongolia was a fellow by the name
                    of Richard Williams. Dick Williams never resided in Mongolia. He was ambassador
                    to Mongolia concurrently with being chief of the China desk in the Department of
                    State. He had been consul general in Hong Kong. He would go to Mongolia from
                    time to time. The first ambassador of the United States to reside in Ulaanbaatar
                    was a fellow who now lives in Dallas by the name of Joseph Lake.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is Joe Lake here?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNNINGHAM: Joe Lake is in Dallas. He is now the director of international
                    affairs for the city of Dallas. I don't think that Joe took Mongolian language
                    training and I don't know if anybody else has taken Mongolian language training
                    to tell you the truth. Maybe by now we have got somebody who knows Mongolian.
                    Joe was the first resident U.S. Ambassador, and that was not until sometime in
                    the early '90s.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think it probably was.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNNINGHAM: Because his next post after that was Albania.</p>
                <pb facs="0109" n="Page0109"/>
                <p>Q: I've interviewed Joe about the Mongolian time. It does seem that we are
                    talking now when the Kennedy administration came in, that there wasn't much to
                    draw on as far as knowledge of China or of how to deal with it. Did you have
                    that feeling that they were sort of Europeanist oriented?</p>
                <p>CUNNINGHAM: In general I can't think of anyone in the Kennedy administration
                    either on the National Security Council or in the Department of State at the
                    level of assistant secretary or above who had a good understanding of Asia. Now
                    we have to remember that Dean Rusk as secretary of State had been in the
                    CBI.</p>
                <p>Q: A colonel and drew the 38th parallel.</p>
                <p>CUNNINGHAM: And drew the 38th parallel and had that kind of exposure. It may be
                    there that they looked to him for policy advice. Averell Harriman was appointed
                    as assistant secretary for East Asian Affairs and was in that capacity when I
                    reported into the Department of State in 1962. He obviously didn't know anything
                    about it either. His dad had built railroads in China but I don't think that
                    Averell Harriman had that much knowledge about it. His principal deputy at the
                    time I think was Ed Rice, now living in Tiburon, California, long retired. He
                    was a China specialisone of the old timers, trained in Beijing in the 1930's. I
                    think it was Rice, though I'm not sure. Above the working level there really
                    wasn't anybody that I can think of who was really up to it on Asia and had had
                    the experience on the ground and knew things.</p>
                <p>That is the legacy of the McCarthy period and the clean sweep that was made of
                    Oliver Edmond Clubb, John Stuart Service, John Carter Vincent, and all the rest
                    of them at the time. There wasn't anybody left to come to that level. Bob
                    Barnett was the deputy assistant secretary for Economic Affairs in the Bureau of
                    Far Eastern Affairs and he is one of the trio of Doak Barnett...</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who just died ten days ago.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNNINGHAM: Yes. And Dwight Barnett. I think Alan Whiting was in the Department
                    of State at that time as chief of research for East Asia. That was sort of it.
                    There was really nobody higher up that I can think of. Harriman was sent off to
                    Vienna to try to arrange some kind of a cease-fire in Laos early in 1963. Roger
                    Hilsman, who had been Director of INR, came in after Harriman as assistant
                    secretary for Far Eastern Affairs. Roger Hilsman is an egomaniac and a
                    namedropper. I don't have any regard for him at all. He's gotten a lot of
                    notoriety in international affairs but I frankly don't...</p>
                <p>Q: His only experience in the area was as a lieutenant in the OSS dropped into
                    Burma. He lived off that as a doer. He had been head of INR but he was not a
                    heavyweight there.</p>
                <pb facs="0110" n="Page0110"/>
                <p>CUNNINGHAM: Not at all, and he really didn't know how to deal with anybody. I
                    remember one experience when I had written a briefing paper for a call that T.F.
                    Tsiang, Tsiang Ting-fu, who was then the ROC ambassador to Washington was to
                    make on Hilsman. T.F. Tsiang was a very distinguished man, a veteran diplomat,
                    an intellectual, with a Ph.D. from Columbia, a true gentleman. He came into
                    Hilsman's office and Hilsman immediately lit a cigar. T.F. Tsiang had emphysema,
                    and it was well known that he was beginning to suffer a lot from it at that
                    time. Hilsman sat in a chair at right angles to the office sofa and right next
                    to the chair to which he motioned Ambassador Tsiang.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's about three feet.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNNINGHAM: Yes. Then Hilsman, with cigar in his left hand, briefing memo in his
                    right hand, and Tsiang to his immediate right, put his left foot up on his right
                    knee with the sole of his shoe pointing in T.F. Tsiang's face. This was
                    Hilsman's awkward way of attempting to be at ease with a visitor, whom I suppose
                    he realized was a man of some distinction in his own right. Hilsman started on
                    his spiel, and the subject had something to do with China's representation in
                    the United Nations - - our constant operating preoccupation. After making a few
                    opening remarks, Hilsman turned to me and said, “This is what you wanted me to
                    say isn't it?” I said, “Well sir, you had the memo.” T.F. looked at me and
                    looked at him, and I suppose wondered just how much reliability there was to
                    U.S. backing for the ROC. It was an extremely graceless exchange, even rude. I
                    don't think Hilsman - - in his own self-consciousness - - had any understanding
                    that his effort and bonhomie was not only transparently artificial, but
                    tasteless as well.</p>
                <p>Hilsman used to go around the bureau and he spoke of everybody in Washington by
                    their first name: Jack, Bobby, Mac, Chet, Chip, this, that, the other, as though
                    he had a personal and intimate relationship with each. You were supposed to know
                    by his first name dropping that he was very close to the high level people in
                    the Department then and in the Administration. He would speak about everybody
                    very familiarly.After Kennedy's assassination, it quickly became clear that
                    Hilsman's manner was complete sham. He delivered a major speech mainly on China
                    policy in December 1963. This speech was mainly drafted by Lindsey Grant on the
                    Mainland China desk, but evidently was not fully cleared by the White House,
                    newly taken over by Lyndon Johnson. When Hilsman made that speech, which
                    contained language more forthcoming to the PRC (I have it somewhere in my files
                    I'm sure) than had been the case up to then and at that level. Everything hit
                    the fan in the White House, and Roger Hilsman was very quickly replaced by Bill
                    Bundy as assistant secretary for East Asian Affairs. I think at that point
                    Hilsman went off to Columbia University or something. He was out of the
                    government.</p>
                <p>McNamara in his book had also stated that we didn't know what wagoing on in
                    Asia.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I've had other people say the hell he didn't. Some of the
                        stufhe was told but he just chose not to listen.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNNINGHAM: A fellow by the name of Lou Soros, I think, who was in INR at the
                    time wrote an op-ed. piece for the New York Times soon after McNamara's book was
                    published saying, “I sent these memoranda up and this was our analysis and
                    recommendation at the time. They were rejected, disregarded, whatever, but our
                    analyses were being sent them.” It was there. The point is I think, at the time
                    there was the knowledge available in the Department of State, and it was good
                    and sound. The language and area training program had been ongoing throughout
                    the 1950s and had been producing capable China specialists who were all over
                    East Asia at that point, but all were at the working level, none at the policy
                    level. The knowledge was available. Then there were people like Art Hummel. I've
                    forgotten where Art was during the Kennedy administration but he was someplace
                    out there. There were people who knew, who understood, and who could have
                    provided advice but somehow it wasn't getting through; it wasn't received.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There was a certain arrogance too as there is in an awful

                </p>
                <p>CUNNINGHAM: Yes.</p>
                <p>Q: I think we might stop at this point. I'll put at the end here that we covered
                    a little bit of when you moved back to Washington. We're talking about the early
                    '60s, '61, '62 when you came back to be on the China desk. Is that right?</p>
                <p>CUNNINGHAM: That's right. I came back to Washington in July or August of 1962 to
                    take up my duties on the Republic of China desk, which we had at that time. We
                    also had a Mainland China affairs section. We have ever since the 1960s, I
                    believe, had two China sections, and still do in effect in the Department of
                    State.</p>
                <p>Q: We'll talk about that. We've already covered Taiwan, the Mongolian situation
                    of should we recognize it or not during the time when you were on the China
                    desk, and we've talked a bit about Roger Hilsman. We'll pick it up then.</p>
                <p>***</p>
                <p>Today is the 3rd of June 1999. Bill you were on the Republic oChina desk from
                    when to when?</p>
                <pb facs="0112" n="Page0112"/>
                <p>CUNNINGHAM: From summer 1962, I think probably the first of July though maybe a
                    little earlier, until 1964 or 1965 at which time I switched to the mainland
                    China section and served there through 1966. I went off to Columbia University
                    for a sabbatical year at the East Asia Institute in January of 1967.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're not sure whether we've covered it or not but you
                        might talabout the representation problem.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNNINGHAM: My main responsibility during the time that I was on the Republic of
                    China desk was to ensure that the Republic of China retained its seat in the
                    United Nations and in other international organizations both within the UN
                    family, as we call them, the 13 specialized agencies, and other international
                    bodies that were not related organically to the UN system but nonetheless which
                    had a symbolic political importance in the international scheme. The thinking at
                    that time was that if the PRC gained a toehold in any international organization
                    no matter how insignificant and unrelated to the United Nations, that would be
                    the first domino so to speak. We looked at it more as subverting the
                    international system from the bottom up getting into the roots and gradually
                    getting all the way up into the branches and the trunk of the tree, of the
                    system.</p>
                <p>Of course every year our big push was to deal with the annual challenge to the
                    credentials of the Republic of China in the United Nations General Assembly. By
                    the time that I reached the desk in 1962 this process had achieved a standard
                    rhythm and a routine scenario. Along during the summertime the ROC embassy would
                    approach the Department of State to say that the General Assembly session is
                    coming up and we want to make sure that everything is in order. This was a
                    discreet way of reaffirming the assurance of U.S. support for the ROC's position
                    as the legitimate representative of China in the United Nations. This approach
                    usually was made at the desk leveand to me when I got into the job. That routine
                    demarche would trigger a circular telegram generated by the Republic of China
                    desk, which had to be cleared with every bureau in the Department as well as
                    with the Bureau of International Organizational Affairs. A man by the name of
                    Bert Wabeke in the IO bureau was my counterpart, and I worked with him on this
                    China representation question. We would circularize all of our posts abroad to
                    warn them that the General Assembly session was coming up and that there would
                    be a challenge to the credentials of the delegation of the Republic of China to
                    sit in the General Assembly.Now the Security Council was never an issue in these
                    circulars because China is a permanent member of the Security Council and the UN
                    charter in fact identifies the Republic of China as the permanent member of the
                    Security Council. It is a continuing body and there would never be an issue of
                    the credentials of the representative of the Republic of China in the Security
                    Council unless there was a change in permanent representatives. We'll come back
                    to the Security Council and the difference in a moment and continue with the
                    General Assembly.</p>
                <pb facs="0113" n="Page0113"/>
                <p>Our circular telegram would go out instructing our embassies abroad, those that
                    were in capitals of countries friendly to the Republic of China and friendly to
                    the United States, were known supporters of the position of the Republic of
                    China or opponents of the PRC, to go into the Foreign Ministry and say, now we
                    are counting on you to support the credentials of the Republic of China
                    delegation in the forthcoming General Assembly session and this is why we think
                    you should. We would fashion a series of arguments to support our position that
                    the Republic of China should be the representative of China in the United
                    Nations, usually citing the misbehaviors of the People's Republic of China as
                    one of the principal arguments against this. Their conduct had shown that they
                    were not peace loving people and that they were not entitled to represent the
                    Chinese people in the General Assembly.</p>
                <p>Q: I would imagine that one of your jobs on the desk would be to collect the
                    problems of each year, to keep a list. Every time you read that something had
                    happened in someplace you would sort of jump up and down and add this to your
                    list.</p>
                <p>CUNNINGHAM: That's right. Burt Wabeke and I kept a running log of the
                    misbehaviors of the People's Republic of China and the things that they were
                    doing that we thought that we could use as arguments against a change in the
                    representation of China. Now the period that I was there in 1962 to 1964, a
                    period of about two or three General Assemblies, of course was the end of the
                    great leap forward and the beginnings of the Cultural Revolution in China, so it
                    was easy to come up with all kinds of evidence saying, “Look how these people
                    treat their own. Can you imagine what harm they are going to do to world peace
                    if they get into the United Nations?” We would send this out and we would ask
                    for responses.</p>
                <p>Then of course we would tally everything that came in. We had several categories:
                    those that were very firm and that we could count on and that were reliable;
                    those that were perhaps wavering a little bit and indicated some uncertainty;
                    those that were sitting on the fence; and those that we knew were a lost cause,
                    the Warsaw bloc for example and the Soviet Union. I think India was a strong
                    supporter of the PRC, as were Indonesia, third world countries, members of the
                    African-Asian bloc, and so on. Anyway we would tally all this up and we would
                    sometimes go out with a second round to the ones that looked a little bit shaky
                    or uncertain and follow-up with them. Our objective was to get as many firm
                    commitments as we possibly could by the beginning of the General Assembly
                    session.</p>
                <pb facs="0114" n="Page0114"/>
                <p>We also would look very carefully at those that we counted upon for support to
                    see whether they had paid up their assessments to the United Nations and thereby
                    would be able to vote. There were some countries that would fall in arrears.
                    Another track that we would follow was, “Make sure that you pay your UN dues. We
                    are going to count on you for this vote and you had better get your payment in
                    there.” We would follow up on that. We would then of course lobby the
                    delegations at the General Assembly in New York. Normally the bureau would
                    deploy a liaison officer to go up there. I had that duty during the 17th General
                    Assembly. One of the principal duties for that officer of the Bureau of East
                    Asian Affairs was to go around and lobby all of the delegations on the Republic
                    of China question.</p>
                <p>What would happen in the General Assembly is that the reports of the credentials
                    of all delegations would be sent to the credentials committee of the General
                    Assembly, which would then examine them to ensure that the credentials of each
                    delegation were in good order. I think that committee was appointed by the
                    president of the General Assembly. Our delegation would be in touch with the
                    president of the General Assembly to find out who was going to be on the
                    committee. We wanted to make sure that we had the right balance in terms of
                    China representation on the committee so we would get a favorable vote out of
                    that. Of course, all General Assembly committees have to be carefully chosen to
                    reflect the balance of persuasions in the United Nations by region, stage of
                    development and political outlook. The committee would consider the credentials
                    during the entire session and finally toward the end of the General Assembly
                    session the credentials committee would make its report to the plenary of the
                    General Assembly. The General Assembly normally does not overturn committee
                    reports; it rubber-stamps them for the most part. It is very difficult to open
                    up a committee report in the General Assembly; the rules make it difficult to do
                    so.</p>
                <p>Of course the report of the credentials committee of the General Assembly would
                    be the occasion for the debate on the legitimacy of the Republic of China to sit
                    in China's seat in the United Nations. We would have to prepare the U. S.
                    delegation with a statement, and arguments, and respond to whatever challenges
                    would be brought up by other countries and supporters of the PRC in the General
                    Assembly debate. My job was to maintain close contact with the ROC embassy in
                    Washington D.C. to keep a running tally on all the members of the General
                    Assembly, to follow up on the instructions to the field, to make sure that the
                    right instructions went to the delegation in New York, to work with the Bureau
                    of International Organizational Affairs on that, and then to do all of the back
                    stopping that was involved and that was in two dimensions. One was to watch what
                    might be going on in let's say, if there is such a thing, the International Rose
                    Fanciers' Club where there are national representations of some kind or other
                    just to make sure that somebody didn't try to sneak a Chinese communist
                    delegation into whatever seat was legitimately occupied by the Republic of
                    China.</p>
                <pb facs="0115" n="Page0115"/>
                <p>The other thing that we followed very closely during this time was the policy
                    toward China of newly independent countries because the decolonization process
                    was going on. I got so good at all of this that I knew the names of every
                    foreign minister in Africa and the capitals of every country there. I could reel
                    them off in my sleep because I was sending off telegrams all the time to our
                    embassies out there saying, “Now make sure that the foreign minister understands
                    who are the good Chinese and who are the bad Chinese and that they work very
                    closely and establish diplomatic relations with the Republic of China.” Of
                    course the ROC was doing its bit during this time too. It wasn't all up to us.
                    They deserve credit.</p>
                <p>My very good friend Yang His-k'un, whom I saw in August of '98 when I visited
                    Taiwan, very old now and fully retired, was the Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs
                    of the ROC. I believe he was Director of UN affairs Bureau in the foreign
                    ministry when I served in Taipei and then later on he became a Vice-Minister and
                    Ambassador to South Africa. He was the best known Chinese in Africa, better
                    known on a personal basis than Chou En-lai. This was because Yang had been in
                    the UN Secretariat in the 1950's and had been a member of UN visiting missions
                    going out to these countries while were still colonized, helping them prepare
                    for independence. The UN sent out these missions to help set up their
                    governments and prepare them for self-government. Yang got to know all those
                    people who were leaders politically in those days, but were nobodies
                    internationally, and who later on became foreign ministers, prime ministers,
                    etc., etc. He was great friends with all of them. Yang would go off every year
                    on a grand tour of Africa and other countries, but particularly Africa, seeing
                    all his old friends and jollying them up. Yang was an extremely good diplomat.
                    He was a very effective man.</p>
                <p>As the economy of the Republic of China improved it also introduced a number of
                    aid programs, particularly agricultural assistance programs, in these countries.
                    The Republic of China government had had very good success with land reform and
                    agricultural development in Taiwan. They had good, legitimate programs to show
                    like crop improvements, livestock improvements, pest control, seed development,
                    land use methods, and so on. They extended technical assistance to a lot of
                    countries in Africa to build cordial relations with them. There was kind of a
                    competition which I monitored very closely.</p>
                <p>I worked on three levels. On the General Assembly level, on watching the
                    international organizations with governmental representation that were not UN
                    related but nonetheless were official organizations in the international
                    community. I worked with the Republic of China embassy to follow up and to
                    coordinate our efforts with them and to consult with them. It was a full time
                    job as liaison with the ROC embassy, monitoring the UN agencies and other
                    unrelated international organizations, and working with our embassies in the
                    developing countries as they established diplomatic relations upon independence.
                    I also was just kind of monitoring what was going on in China and what was going
                    on internationally as it related to this China representation issue.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You moved over to the Mainland China desk from '65 to
                        '67?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNNINGHAM: Yes. From early '65 or late '64. I was essentially twyears on each
                    desk.</p>
                <p>Q: What was going on in mainland China because I get confused about when the
                    Great Leap Forward stopped and the Cultural Revolution started? What were we
                    seeing in China and how were we interpreting it? How did we see it developing at
                    that time?</p>
                <p>CUNNINGHAM: There were three issues involved at that time. The first was that the
                    Great Leap Forward had ended about 1962 or 1963 catastrophically, as we now
                    know. There was a famine during the last years of the Great Leap Forward and
                    according to some statisticians the population of China shrank by a couple of
                    million during that period of time from 1960 to about 1963 or 1964. Then of
                    course there were recriminations within the Chinese political structure and
                    inner councils as to what had caused this setback, the failure of this policy,
                    and what the remedy should be.</p>
                <p>The upshot of that was the great Cultural Revolution in which Mao Zedong went
                    over the heads of the Politburo and the political leadership of the PRC to the
                    populace as a whole in an attempt to do two things. One was to counter the
                    criticisms of those who blamed him for the failures of the Great Leap Forward,
                    this utopian scheme that he had, and secondly to reinvigorate what he felt was
                    the flagging revolutionary spirit of the population. He launched the Red Guard
                    movement and the little red book studying the thoughts of Mao. Of course he had
                    lots of people helping him who were dependent on his success for the future of
                    their own political careers. I suppose some peoplthere are in every organization
                    and every societwere true believers in the doctrine.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did we see Chou En-lai at this time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNNINGHAM: Chou En-lai was highly regarded in the community of China
                    specialists, that is to say within the government and also within the scholarly
                    community. Chou was looked upon as the moderator, the urbane, the cosmopolite,
                    the man who understood how the world worked and who knew how to accommodate the
                    relationships between societies that were different ideologically, economically,
                    and politically, from China, always to China's advantage. He was seen as the
                    go-between, the mediator, and he was idealized in this role by a lot of people
                    including myself at that time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did we see him as a creature of Mao's?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0117" n="Page0117"/>
                <p>CUNNINGHAM: No, we did not see him as a creature of Mao. We saw him as a partner.
                    As somebody whose advice was very influential with Mao Zedong and as somebody
                    who could not act on his own, but who exercised a great deal of influence over
                    the direction of Chinese policy and in a way as a counterbalance to the ideology
                    and the utopianism of Mao Zedong. The main interest I think in the Department of
                    State, and particularly on the China desk, was Chou En-la's role in
                    international relations and in China's foreign policy, not so much his role in
                    domestic policy. Obviously he had a great deal to do with domestic policy and
                    had an important role there because he was the Prime Minister, but we emphasized
                    more what he was doing in the international field than what he was doing in the
                    domestic field. The transition from the Great Leap Forward to the Cultural
                    Revolution was one major preoccupation, one of the major centers of attention of
                    the Mainland China desk at that time.</p>
                <p>The second concern of the Mainland China desk was China's policy towards the war
                    in Vietnam because it was in 1964 that things really began to heat up in
                    Vietnam. We were moving towards the decision to commit ground troops there. The
                    Tonkin Gulf incident, the alleged firing upon the USS Turner Joy, I think took
                    place in the fall of 1964 if I'm not mistaken. I get a little bit mixed up on
                    the sequence of events. That was a watershed event; the retaliation and the air
                    strikes against the North Vietnamese in retaliation for the firing upon the
                    Turner Joy. We were moving into that and we were watching very closely. Would
                    the Chinese come into the war or would the Chinese not come into the war? How
                    would they behave towards this? The backdrop for that was the Sino-Soviet split,
                    which was worsening all this time. How the Chinese- (end of tape)</p>
                <p>The second preoccupation was what the Chinese would do with or in opposition to
                    the Soviets with regards to supporting Vietnam. It was a triangular game there.
                    The Chinese obviously did not want the Soviets to gain the predominant position
                    in Vietnam and in effect outflank them and become the second major player in
                    Southeast Asia in counterpoint to the United States. On the other hand, the
                    Chinese were weakened by the Great Leap Forward. They were in the throes of the
                    Great Cultural Revolution and things were going haywire all over China. The
                    transportation network was severely stressed. The Vietnamese were pleading for
                    material support of all kinds, logistical support. The Chinese were shipping a
                    lot to the Vietnamese by various means. And then the Russians were expecting the
                    Chinese to ship the Russian logistical support through China to support Vietnam.
                    The Chinese were not up to handling all of that. Their capabilities were
                    strained by domestic requirements and there was an overburden that they simply
                    could not handle. But, if they protested too much or resisted too much on those
                    grounds, this would be looked upon by the Soviets as failing to support a
                    fraternal socialist people against the imperialistic American aggressors and
                    would be looked upon by the Vietnamese as a betrayal and provide an open door
                    for Soviet influence to increase in Southeast Asia, which the Chinese did not
                    want.</p>
                <pb facs="0118" n="Page0118"/>
                <p>This whole triangular, complicated relationship was going on there and we were
                    paying a lot of attention to trying to figure out what the Chinese were going to
                    do and how they were going to behave in this situation as it affected our
                    interests in Southeast Asia and Vietnam. I participated in a couple of war game
                    exercises relating to this program. Two of them in the Pentagon during that
                    time. They took place down in the basement of the Pentagon where people tried to
                    project certain scenarios of one sort or another. Much of it was directed
                    towards what would the Chinese do if...?</p>
                <p>Q: What was our feeling then. Here you have a China which you describe as not
                    being able really to take care of its own and yet in the Vietnam War we were
                    projecting a China that was in a sense trying to increase its empire. We
                    considered it a threat all over. It wasn't just Communism, but the Chinese
                    themselves.</p>
                <p>CUNNINGHAM: Well, there were two trains of thought and I think each gave some
                    credence to the other. One was that China was too weak, did not want to confront
                    the United States, had done so in Korea and learned the difficult lesson
                    militarily, and just did not want to go to war with the United States. So, the
                    Chinese could be expected to support the Vietnamese as fraternal allies against
                    the “American imperialists” but would not commit their own forces or get
                    themselves into a situation where Chinese blood would be shed as a result of
                    American weaponry or military action. They would avoid that contingency.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, there was a great deal of extremely hostile propaganda coming
                    out of China at that time directed at United States policy in Vietnam. Much of
                    this propaganda was whipped up by the fervor of the Great Cultural Revolution
                    that was going on in China at the time. The Great Cultural Revolution was a
                    rejection of all things Western and led to the destruction of every vestige of
                    Western influence that anyone could find in China including the destruction of
                    all pianos. Anything that was corrupt, bourgeois, alien, Western in any way was
                    either criticized and denounced or destroyed. People were hounded to denounce
                    such ideas. That campaign meshed with the tenor of the Chinese propaganda or
                    pronouncements with respect to the American involvement in Vietnam.</p>
                <p>So, it was puzzling. You could make the argument that the Chinese were whipping
                    themselves up to get involved militarily in this thing and at the outset you
                    really couldn't be sure because you could see both sides of this equation and
                    either scenario had a certain amount of credibility to it. So, we had to play it
                    by ear and keep testing this thing as we went along.</p>
                <pb facs="0119" n="Page0119"/>
                <p>One of the main ways of testing it was through the ambassadorial level
                    conversations in Warsaw that went on at that time. During the early part of the
                    1960s, the period that I was on the Mainland China desk, those conversations
                    were held pretty regularly about once a month. I was not involved in the
                    preparation of the instructions for our representatives at those talks. It was
                    Ambassador Cabot who conducted them at that time. But, I would see them as they
                    went out and I would see the readout as the reports came in. I was not involved
                    in briefing the Republic of China embassy, which we regularly did at the deputy
                    assistant secretary level. As soon as we got the report from Warsaw, the embassy
                    would get a call to come over to get briefed on it. So, I was close to all of
                    the output and input to it. These conversations, when the transcripts become
                    available, are going to be pretty polemical on both sides. What we were doing on
                    our side was countering, debunking, and denouncing the arguments that the
                    Chinese had made in the previous round. You know, “You said so-and-so and here
                    is our response to that.” These transcripts, particularly the Chinese, then were
                    very carefully analyzed. to see what clues they might give us toward the
                    direction the Chinese were taking in regards to Vietnam and in regards to their
                    relationship to the U.S.</p>
                <p>But, there were other things that we did through Warsaw to make sure that after a
                    while nobody stumbled on the trip wire. For example, there was one instance in
                    which a U.S. aircraft flying a mission over the South China Sea fired a missile
                    and the thing went astray and went into Chinese airspace. The Pentagon let us
                    know about that right away and we fired off an urgent message to Warsaw to
                    inform the Chinese embassy that a missile had gone astray and entered Chinese
                    air space and probably landed somewhere in China. It was a mistake and there was
                    nothing intentional about this. Please understand that it was not an attack on
                    the PRC but just a misfire. I think there was an incident where a U.S. pilot
                    either overflew Chinese territory in South China or was downed by antiaircraft
                    fire or something. We very quickly notified the Chinese of this also. What we
                    began doing was working very hard to reassure them that we had no hostile intent
                    towards the PRC.</p>
                <p>In the meantime, of course, there were some people in China who were talking
                    about the development of nuclear weapons and nuclear capabilities and making
                    very strong statements in this regard. But, now in retrospect we realize they
                    were of a defensive nature and were not intended to be threatening or
                    illustrative of Chinese intentions towards the U.S. and Vietnam. But, at the
                    time that attracted a lot of attention. We were trying to figure out just what
                    they meant by making such volatile and inflammatory statements.</p>
                <pb facs="0120" n="Page0120"/>
                <p>I would say that a considerable part of the energies of the Mainland China desk
                    during those years was directed towards the Chinese policy in Vietnam. I used to
                    prepare every morning a short memorandum digest for the assistant secretary
                    based upon incoming overnight telegrams and FBIS readouts. I would get in before
                    the opening of business, the Department used to open about 8:30 in those days
                    and Bill Bundy, the Assistant Secretary for East Asia, had a 9:00 am staff
                    meeting. I would try to get in before 8:00 and pick up the overnight take from
                    FBIS and pick up the telegrams. I would skim through to see what there was in
                    there that should be drawn to the assistant secretary's attention and provide a
                    little bit of interpretation or pr�cis - this is what this means. Some of my
                    memos were good and some were bad, but it was a kind of daily grind that you had
                    to go through. The key thing in all of those was what's new in regard to Vietnam
                    today from the China standpoint. That was the main thing that I worked on.</p>
                <p>Other things that we worked on, and I am reminded of this because I saw Art
                    Dornheim yesterday at lunch. Art was on the desk with me and he was the guy who
                    was responsible for monitoring the embargo on trade with the Peoples Republic of
                    China. Of course, when we instituted this embargo in the 1950s it was as
                    hermetically sealed as you could possibly make it. In fact, it was so tight that
                    afterwards people realized that it didn't allow us to buy the “Peoples Daily” in
                    Hong Kong, so we couldn't translate the thing to find out what the Chinese were
                    saying. There had to be exceptions granted.</p>
                <p>Another thing that was going on during those years on the China desk, and it
                    influenced me later on, was that we were trying to find small ways in which to
                    gradually ease the limitations upon contacts with the PRC because we felt that
                    if the PRC were too confined, too constricted in its contact with the outside
                    world the new generation rising up since liberation in 1949 and gradually taking
                    positions in the bureaucracy there would not have a true perspective on the
                    United States and the outside world. It was considered unhealthy for the future
                    of China's relationship with the world for it to be completely sealed off from
                    what was going on.</p>
                <pb facs="0121" n="Page0121"/>
                <p>For example, and this is an extreme example but it is representative of both the
                    restrictions and of the lengths to which we went. Art was responsible for
                    monitoring the embargo on trade with the PRC, which was total. There was an
                    instance in which a 12 or 14 year old boy, who was a pheasant fancier out in
                    South Dakota, sent a letter to somebody in the Department of State, probably the
                    secretary, and it ended up on Art Dornheim's desk. In the letter this boy said
                    that he knew there were pheasants in North China, as there are pheasants in
                    South Dakota on the prairie. He had been corresponding with a counterpart in
                    North China who was a pheasant fancier and this counterpart was willing to
                    exchange pheasant eggs with him so that South Dakota pheasants could be hatched
                    in North China and North China pheasants could be hatched in South Dakota. The
                    boy wanted help in getting an export license from the Department of Commerce
                    that would lift the ban for strategic purposes on trade with the Peoples
                    Republic of China to allow a non-monetary exchange of pheasant eggs between the
                    U.S. and the PRC by this young boy and his pen pal in North China. That is
                    illustrative of the extremes to which we went to prevent any commercial contact
                    whatsoever with the Peoples Republic of China under the Trading with the Enemy
                    Act. Art Dornheim worked on this thing and succeeded in getting an export
                    license for the exchange of pheasant eggs. He did things like that periodically.
                    There was a little tally that we kept there in the office. Each one of these
                    successful cases represented a further step in removing barriers to contact
                    between the U.S. and the PRC. Very incremental barriers.</p>
                <p>Of course, there were times when there was a natural disaster of some kind or
                    other in the PRC and we offered humanitarian assistance, medicines and food
                    assistance. In most instances the Chinese declined those offers, but in making
                    them we were assured we would be able to obtain an exception to the ban on
                    commercial exchanges or exchanges of any kind with the People Republic of China
                    to permit that sort of thing to go forward. And, I'm sure there are other
                    instances, but I don't recall them offhand now, of steps that we took to
                    increase communication with the PRC.</p>
                <pb facs="0122" n="Page0122"/>
                <p>We also used to assiduously scoop up every scrap of information we could from any
                    traveler who went to the PRC of any nationality who had had contact with people
                    at the top levels. For example, Felix Greene, who I think is a British or New
                    Zealand correspondent, made a couple of trips into China in the 1960s and when
                    he came out he would be contacted by the consulate general in Hong Kong and be
                    debriefed fully. They would report back and we would have some questions to be
                    put to Felix Greene wherever we could find him. We used to debrief Edgar Snow,
                    who made a couple of trips to China, in Hong Kong, and I think in the U.S. He
                    was exhaustively debriefed each time. There was a Yugoslav correspondent in
                    Beijing whose reports we used to find very, very informative. He had good
                    contacts in the establishment there and his news reports and analyses were very
                    useful to us in understanding what was going on in the PRC. But, all of this was
                    a laborious process, not only on our desk but in FBIS, INR, the CIA and every
                    other open source we could possibly find to help construct from all the
                    available information some kind of a picture of what was going on in the PRC,
                    what they were thinking, what they were believing, who was important, who was
                    under attack within the establishment, etc. Then to attempt through third
                    parties to validate, verify or discount some of these impressions. It was like
                    diagnosing a patient whom you couldn't see or touch.</p>
                <p>Q: What was the attitude on the China desk about eventually recognizing China? I
                    would have thought with the turmoil within China this didn't feel like a good
                    time that you could really get very far with anything.</p>
                <p>CUNNINGHAM: There were two schools of thought, both, I think, within the Mainland
                    China section and more broadly within the bureau and particularly between the
                    Mainland China section, the Republic of China section....we can broaden it out a
                    bit more. There were really four, maybe five, corners to this analysis. The
                    Republic of China section, the American embassy in Taipei, the U.S. consulate
                    general in Hong Kong, and the Mainland China section in the Department of State.
                    I think you might say the body of China advisors, scholars and analysts who are
                    close to the diplomatic establishment in Washington, including the intelligence
                    community. People like Doak Barnett at the Brookings Institution, other
                    respected people who were very good analysts, had spent time in China, devoted
                    their lives to studying it, provided much of the background material and were in
                    regular communication with the Department of State, particularly with the
                    Mainland China desk. There were some who were cordial to the idea of actively
                    seeking to broaden contact with the PRC with the eventual goal of establishing
                    formal relations. Cognizant, of course, of all the difficulties that would be
                    involved in that in terms of our relationship with the Republic of China, in
                    terms of symbolism with regard to the cold war as a whole, in terms of
                    perceptions of the PRC and what our motivations were, and everything else that
                    you can think of. And then there were other people who were very wary of this
                    idea and did not see any redeeming features in the PRC establishment that would
                    warrant initiatives on the part of the United States. Did not even think they
                    would be reciprocated by the PRC. They weren't necessarily against the idea.</p>
                <pb facs="0123" n="Page0123"/>
                <p>I was one of those who was wary and had serious reservations about this. My
                    reservations were very strong at the time that I joined the Mainland China desk,
                    but over the two years that I worked there those reservations moderated when I
                    understood better what was going on. So, using myself as an example of those who
                    were very conservative and reserved about this idea, initially when I first
                    joined the China desk in late 1964 ...I wanted to work there in order to be a
                    true China specialist, but I did not go there with the expectation or intention
                    that I would contribute towards the development of a relationship with the PRC.
                    Rather, I would go there with the expectation that I would be working in a very
                    guarded fashion with regards to the initiatives and what the PRC might try to
                    do. But, the more you worked in that field, regardless of your persuasion, the
                    more you came to realize that this is a country that cannot be ignored. It is
                    there, you have to deal with it, you have to cope with it some how, and I did
                    not leave that job with any understanding of how that might be done, any formula
                    for doing that, but what I did leave there with was the belief that things would
                    have to change and we would have to move in that direction. Somehow or other an
                    accommodation of some kind was going to have to be reached in dealing with the
                    PRC.</p>
                <p>So, I believe that is a fair description of the classifications. I do not recall
                    that there were ever accusatory relationships among the people who were the
                    China specialists of my generation who worked on this problem. We were a special
                    generation because for the most part, almost all of us had had no experience on
                    the PRC mainland. Our only contact and understanding of Chinese personalities
                    and attitudes was formed through study in graduate schools at universities in
                    the United States such as Columbia, Harvard and Yale. Burton Levin, for example,
                    a very good friend of mine and colleague of this period, is an example of that.
                    Burt is a graduate of Brooklyn and did graduate studies at Columbia University
                    in the East Asian Institute, a very fine institution. And there were others like
                    Morton Abramowitz, who got his training at Harvard. So there were people who had
                    that kind of background. There were some people like myself who didn't have that
                    academic background but had some kind of experience in Asia and then came into
                    the Chinese language program under FSI auspices studied Chinese and did area
                    studies, which was more or less self-selected reading and some lectures in the
                    Foreign Service Institute at that time. That was true of several dozen of the
                    China specialists who came into the service in the 1950s or at the end of the
                    1940s and worked all through this period ('50s, '60s and into the '70s) to some
                    extent under the guidance of people like Al Jenkins and Graham Martin and others
                    who had served in China as very junior officers in the 1940s. We had the benefit
                    of their wisdom and viewpoints. And people like Ed Rice, who was trained in the
                    1930s and worked on China in the 1940s. What we were deprived of was the
                    experience, and the vision and viewpoint and understanding of people like John
                    Stuart Service, John Davies, John Carter Vincent and others who were very strong
                    China specialists but who had been eliminated through the McCarthy purges of the
                    early 1950s. We didn't have the benefit of that kind of guidance and mentorship
                    in developing our points of view. That was a handicap.</p>
                <pb facs="0124" n="Page0124"/>
                <p>I don't mean by that that we necessarily would have bought their viewpoint, but
                    it was a gap in the development of our capabilities. All the time that I worked
                    on China affairs I was always very conscious of what I didn't know. From what I
                    learned through my contacts and work in Taiwan and my studies and other
                    experiences in Asia I think I developed a pretty good understanding of the
                    Chinese mentality and personality, their outlook and philosophy. I have great
                    respect for my colleagues with whom I worked during that period and many of whom
                    have very fine minds and understanding of things, but I don't think that there
                    were any “greats” among us on the scale of people like George Kennan with regard
                    to Russia and the Soviet Union, not that level of thoughtfulness, and probity
                    and understanding. Maybe there never will be, I don't know.</p>
                <p>Q: Speaking of the Soviet Union, from the China desk, how seriously did we at
                    that time look upon the differences between Red China and Red Soviet Union?</p>
                <p>CUNNINGHAM: I don't think that we accepted the Sino-Soviet split until the
                    partial test ban treaty was concluded in 1963. Donald Zagoria had published his
                    book about 1960 or 1961. It came out just at the beginning of the Kennedy
                    administration. Even by the time that I reached the China desk in 1962, this
                    thesis was very widely disputed and discounted within the Department of
                    State.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: His thesis being?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNNINGHAM: That the Chinese and the Soviets had reached an irreconcilable
                    division between them and that they should not be looked upon as common allies
                    but rather as potential adversaries of one another. That point of view was very
                    widely questioned. It was not accepted as the basis of our policy, certainly, at
                    the time I arrived on the China desk. We still saw areas of cooperation between
                    the Soviet Union and the Peoples Republic of China, but then when the test ban
                    treaty took place and Harriman went to Moscow to sign the treaty, the Chinese
                    denunciation of the Soviets for entering into that convention was fierce. From
                    that time on, I think the general view changed and it became accepted that the
                    Chinese and the Soviets had reached a point where they could not be regarded as
                    working hand in glove with one another any longer. There were serious points of
                    dispute between them. There were border clashes. And, of course, in October of
                    1964 the Chinese detonated their own nuclear device, which the Russians did not
                    like at all and which exacerbated Soviet fears of China. Again, this background
                    became very important in the analysis of Chinese and Soviet behavior in regards
                    to the Vietnam War. I think people have to understand it was a very complex
                    puzzle that we were trying to figure out at that time as to how each party would
                    behave and how this would affect the outcome of our war in Vietnam.</p>
                <pb facs="0125" n="Page0125"/>
                <p>Q: Were you on the China desk ever sitting together with colleagues on the Soviet
                    desk and running through notes to see if there were any changes on how things
                    were going, or was this each done on its own?</p>
                <p>CUNNINGHAM: That is a very interesting question. We did not have a lot of
                    communication with the Soviet desk on a regular basis. That is to say, we didn't
                    get together with them daily and hash things over. But, we did have contact with
                    them. I think at some point we deployed a China specialist to the embassy in
                    Moscow.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, I think Bill Brown was one.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNNINGHAM: Bill Brown was one. Stape Roy was another.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But at the desk level? You were in the same building.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNNINGHAM: That's right and around the corner from each other. I remember going
                    over there from time to time with telegrams to clear and getting kind of a
                    quizzical response from people on the Soviet desk. It was sort of, well, you
                    people don't really understand the Soviet mentality because what you are saying
                    in regard to this particular problem is a little bit out of the context of our
                    understanding of the Soviets and the Soviet mentality. And, our comment was that
                    they didn't understand the mentality of the Chinese. This was not a hostile
                    relationship, but there was a clear perceptual separation, you might say, that I
                    think to some extent militated against a close coordination of effort on the
                    part of the U.S.</p>
                <p>Q: I was just thinking. The State Department and the Department of Defense
                    usually had one of their assistant secretaries having breakfast together once a
                    week or so. I would think that you should have had almost the equivalent of that
                    at some place with a relative senior person in the China and Soviet areas. Just
                    getting together and talking to each other once a week or something like
                    that.</p>
                <pb facs="0126" n="Page0126"/>
                <p>CUNNINGHAM: There wasn't a rivalry, but I cannot recall any systematic
                    coordinated attempt to cultivate on the part of the Bureau of East Asian Affairs
                    a relationship with the Soviet desk. Obviously we cleared telegrams back and
                    forth and obviously we communicated with one another, but I cannot recall that
                    we ever made a systematic effort to understand the point of view of the other
                    and to talk it over and to get together on a regular basis. In fact, I do not
                    recall on the part of the Bureau of East Asian Affairs any systematic, organized
                    attempt to compare, discuss or contrast our understanding of what was going on
                    in our region with the understanding held by officers in other regions like
                    South Asia. After all there were Indian-Soviet border clashes during this time.
                    We didn't have a cross cultural approach at that time to the fashioning of our
                    policy. Maybe that is one of the weaknesses of our organization institutionally
                    of the Department of State that by dividing the world into regions we have to
                    some extent compartmentalized the development, fashioning of our policy with the
                    countries of those regions.</p>
                <p>Q: From your perspective at the time, what was the role of Dean Rusk? He
                    obviously had concerns in Asia, but one has the feeling that he was working so
                    hard with Vietnam that the rest of Asia kind of fell by the wayside as far as
                    his focus was concerned. Did you have any feel of input there?</p>
                <p>CUNNINGHAM: As the 1960s went on, Vietnam more and more took over the foreign
                    policy agenda of the U.S. Rusk more and more devoted himself to being the prime
                    defender of the administration's policy in Vietnam. Part of that was the
                    personal relationship that Rusk had with President Johnson. My understanding at
                    the time was that there was a very strong bond of trust and fraternalism you
                    might say between the two of them. Rusk could be counted upon any time that the
                    question of Vietnam came up to go right down the line in the most rigorous
                    defense of the U.S. position in regard to Vietnam. The prime example of that was
                    the hearings in the Senate foreign relations committee conducted by Fulbright on
                    the Vietnam War. At one point I think Rusk was up there perhaps two full days,
                    maybe longer. He was questioned in exhaustive detail by Fulbright principally
                    but also by other members of the committee as well. He was staunch and
                    unyielding in defense of the administration's position in those hearings.</p>
                <p>I suppose that more and more our relations with other countries in Asia came to
                    be measured by their attitude towards our policy in Vietnam. It is not that we
                    had no bilateral interests, obviously we did and attended to them, but the
                    Vietnam War became an all-consuming consideration in setting the tenor of our
                    relations with the other countries in the region.</p>

                <p>CUNNINGHAM: In January 1967 I left the Bureau of East Asian Affairs and went to
                    Columbia University under the FSI auspices to do a year of study on East Asia. I
                    was there for the entire year. Normally people go at the beginning of the fall
                    semester and stay through the academic year, but our 5th child was due in
                    October 1966 so I had the opportunity to do this sabbatical year but I asked to
                    have the beginning of it deferred until the spring semester began so that I
                    could be home for the birth of our 5th child and help with things around the
                    house. That was granted and as a consequence I had not only the spring semester
                    and fall semester of 1967 at Columbia, but also the summer session there.</p>

                        didn'it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNNINGHAM: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find it from your perspective and what you
                        were doinat that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNNINGHAM: The Vietnam teach-ins had already begun the previous year. The campus
                    movements of opposition to the Vietnam War got underway in 1967 and there was
                    evidence of that all over the campus. Of course, other things were going on,
                    too. This was the period of the civil rights movement in the United States and
                    that was picking up a lot of steam. The civil rights act had been passed two
                    years previously, so there was a lot of agitation about that. and the two tended
                    to play into one another in some respects among student activists. I can't
                    recall ever being personally confronted by anybody over our policy in Vietnam,
                    but there was obvious growing of dislike for it both among faculty and students
                    on campus. Among the faculty at Columbia there was again a difference of opinion
                    about what we were doing in Vietnam, where this was leading, and I can't recall
                    too clearly now, what the various opinions were. I personally was cordially
                    received by all the members of the faculty in the East Asian Institute and
                    elsewhere and got to know many of them very well. There were a few occasions
                    when I was called upon to discuss U.S. policy in Vietnam, about which I had
                    serious misgivings, myself. After all, I had been in Vietnam during the French
                    war against Vietnam and I saw how that turned out. And, as I think I said
                    previously when I was called up to Bill Bundy's office one day in the '60s and
                    was told that the marines were going to be landing, we were going into Vietnam
                    with ground combat forces, I had a sinking feeling that this thing was not going
                    to work because of what I had observed during the earlier period when the French
                    were fighting on the ground against the Viet Minh. So, I had mixed feelings
                    about it. When called upon to explain the administration's Vietnam policy, I,
                    myself, had serious reservations about the wisdom of that policy and what the
                    outcome would- (end of tape)</p>
                <pb facs="0128" n="Page0128"/>
                <p>I left Columbia University and went on to my post at Tokyo in 1968 just before
                    the Tet offensive, which was the big turning point in Vietnam. There was
                    obviously rising discontent and it was quite evident on the Columbia University
                    campus, particularly in the fall of 1967 academic year. By that time I was
                    getting busier with my studies and I decided to do a monograph on the attitude
                    of the Chinese Communists towards the United Nations in the period prior to
                    liberation leading up to the beginning of the Korean war. So, I was pretty well
                    buried in research on that and going home on weekends to help out with the
                    family and a lot of personal preoccupations. So, I wasn't seeking opportunities
                    to get involved in foreign policy discussions up there.</p>
                <p>I do remember one time when I was asked, to go up to Providence, Rhode Island
                    with two others to speak about our policy in Vietnam to a church group on the
                    campus of Brown University. This was in the fall of 1967. I agreed to do that.
                    It was a trying experience. My point was that our main motivation for getting
                    involved in this action from my own personal observation and what I understood
                    of U.S. foreign policy was to counter a force that was hostile to the ideals and
                    purposes of American democracy. We were fighting people who were inimical to our
                    way of life.</p>
                <p>One of the other two people on the panel who had been sent either by Washington
                    or was from Washington complimented me on the presentation that I had made and
                    thought it was very good and that I would have to write it up, because it was
                    extemporized, and send it into the State Department, which I did. I don't know
                    if it ever went anywhere or saw the light of day again.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In early 1968 you went to Tokyo. Is that right?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0129" n="Page0129"/>
                <p>CUNNINGHAM: Yes. Either late in the fall of 1967 or early in 1968 I began to
                    realize that the wonderful year at Columbia University was coming to a close and
                    I would soon be going elsewhere and it was about time for the Department of
                    State to decide what they wanted to do with me. So, I went down to Washington to
                    inquire about this. I went to the Department of State and this was one of the
                    oddest events of my career. I was walking down an empty corridor on the 4th
                    floor through the East Asia area of the Department of State, where all the
                    country desks are located on one side of the hall and the administrative offices
                    on the other side of the hall. All of a sudden out of a door down the corridor
                    ahead of me came the man who had succeeded me in Phnom Penh thirteen years
                    previously as administrative officer, Kyle Mitchell. I said,”Hi, Kyle, how are
                    you?” He was then the executive director of the Bureau of East Asian Affairs.
                    His reply bowled me over. “What do you think about that assignment to Tokyo?” I
                    was dumbfounded. I said, “What are you talking about?” He said, “Well, that is
                    where you are supposed to go. You had better go around to the Japan desk and ask
                    them about it.” I said, “Well, okay.” I kept on going, around the corner to the
                    Japan desk and walked in. Dick Sneider was the country director at that time. I
                    went in and said, “Dick, I was going down the hall here and met Kyle Mitchell
                    and he said something to me about going to Japan.” Dick said, “Yeah, that's
                    right. We want you out there in the embassy and you are going to get orders to
                    go. Do you have any objections to that?” I said, “No, no. That is terrific. That
                    is wonderful. I came down here to find out where I was supposed to go.” So, that
                    was it. I guess I owe that assignment to Dick Sneider. He picked me out to be
                    first secretary, head of external affairs in the political section in Tokyo,
                    which deals with the ministry of foreign affairs. So, I was delighted. I went
                    home and told my wife and she was delighted too. So, we started getting things
                    ready to move to Japan. I had to finish this manuscript that I was writing and
                    get myself out of Columbia University. We finally got to Tokyo, March 1968. Skip
                    Purnell was acting political counselor at the time, I believe. I settled into my
                    job as director of external affairs in the political section of the American
                    embassy in Tokyo.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in Tokyo from 1968 until when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNNINGHAM: March 1968 until June 1971. This was a significant period in our
                    relations with Japan because the main thing we were doing at that time was to
                    prepare for the retrocession of Okinawa to Japanese administration. As a result
                    of the settlement, the San Francisco Peace Treaty and the understanding reached
                    at that time, the U.S. would continue to administer Okinawa which we
                    acknowledged was sovereign Japanese territory, but the governor of Okinawa in
                    effect was an American. I was not involved in the negotiations that ended this
                    arrangement.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was Dick Sneider's jewel wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0130" n="Page0130"/>
                <p>CUNNINGHAM: Yes. When I got to Tokyo, David Osborn was the deputy chief of
                    mission and U. Alexis Johnson was the ambassador. This was the third time that I
                    had worked with David Osborn. He had been my boss in Sapporo when I was vice
                    consul. He had been my boss in Taipei when I was second secretary in the
                    political section and he was political counselor, and now he was the DCM, and I
                    was First Secretary of Embassy. That was a grand opportunity to work with an old
                    friend and somebody who I respected very much.</p>
                <p>The other interesting thing was to work for U. Alexis Johnson, who was a veteran
                    ambassador and East Asian hand. There are two things that I remember about U.
                    Alexis Johnson that I think are important to recall.</p>
                <p>He had a reception every month at his residence for all the new arrivals to the
                    embassy to welcome them. It was just for us with nobody from the diplomatic
                    community at all. He and Mrs. Johnson would welcome us as friends and colleagues
                    and members of the family. There would be a little socializing and after a while
                    the ambassador would ask everyone to sit down and he would give us a little talk
                    about how to get along in Japan. He said that he realized that most of us didn't
                    know Japanese and that it was a difficult language to master and that there were
                    many things about the formalisms of Japanese life that were somewhat off putting
                    for foreigners. But, he said that there are a couple of things he had learned
                    that always helped him get along in this country. “The first thing is when you
                    are going out anywhere make sure you always have a notepad and a pencil in your
                    pocket. Japanese know English, they study it from the third grade, but very few
                    of them speak it well. If you speak to them in English they are going to get
                    terribly flustered and embarrassed because they don't know how to answer and
                    they will think they don't understand you at all. So, there is a mental block
                    that develops. What I have learned is if you have a question you want to ask a
                    Japanese write it down. They can all read very well. They will understand it and
                    be much more at ease. Then they will either answer you in spoken English or they
                    will write down the answer for you. In any case, they will accommodate you and
                    take care of you because they are very kind to people who are guests in their
                    country.” He then said that a good way to break the ice with the Japanese is to
                    ask them something about their country or their home town or where they come
                    from, who they are, that kind of thing. Ask about something that is in their
                    background. That is one image I have of U. Alexis Johnson, a very wise man, I
                    think, with a lot of experience about how to get along in a foreign culture.</p>
                <pb facs="0131" n="Page0131"/>
                <p>The second thing is a little episode early in 1968. We had already worked out the
                    retro-cession of the Bonin Islands to Japan. Those are the islands where Iwo
                    Jima is located. They too had remained under U.S. administration along with
                    Okinawa after the San Francisco Treaty. Somebody, probably Dick Sneider, then
                    still country director in the Department, engineered this retrocession, decided
                    that it would be a good idea to use the Bonin Islands as a test case for the
                    return of sovereign Japanese territory to Japanese administration. The Bonins
                    were unique because the people who lived there are not Japanese, they are kind
                    of the offspring of whoever was on the islands in the first place and co-mingled
                    with people who got shipwrecked or somehow ended up there. We wanted to make
                    sure that their interests were taken care of. That was part of the negotiations
                    that we conducted with the Japanese. The Japanese understood very well that this
                    script was a dry run for the retro-cession of Okinawa.</p>
                <p>So, it came time to execute the press release for this and that had to be cleared
                    by Washington, DC. One of my colleagues drafted a suggested press release,
                    Rodney Armstrong, a Japan specialist, Japanese language officer. He was in the
                    section of which I was in charge so it fell to me to take this draft up to
                    Ambassador Johnson to be approved. I read it over and there was something in the
                    text that was a bit obtuse in the sense that you could infer from the press
                    release that this was making a comparison to the eventual return of Okinawa, but
                    it wasn't explicit. I was puzzled by this. I was newly back to Japan and not
                    fully tuned in to the subtleties of life and diplomacy there. I thought to
                    myself, why don't we just come out and say explicitly what our purpose is. Why
                    leave people guessing? After all it is an American press release.</p>
                <p>I took it into the ambassador's office, it was mid day and he was sitting behind
                    his desk, which was absolutely clear, nothing on it. He was smoking a cigarette
                    and reading a book. I was struck by that and thought, hmmm, here is Ambassador
                    Johnson heading up this big embassy with 30 government agencies represented and
                    he is just reading a book and taking it easy in the middle of the day while
                    everyone else is slaving away, working hard. I gave him the telegram and he read
                    it over and said, “What do you think of it?” I said, “Well, you know, Mr.
                    Ambassador, I am kind of puzzled as to why we are not more explicit and direct
                    here about the Bonins being a dry run for the Okinawa retro-cession.” He looked
                    at it and then at me with those twinkling blue eyes of his and said, “Oh, I
                    think it is better to leave things of this kind to the imagination rather than
                    to come out and be too direct about them,” or something to that effect. He said,
                    “I sort of side with the French style of diplomacy in matters of this kind.” I
                    said, “Okay.”</p>
                <pb facs="0132" n="Page0132"/>
                <p>Later on I mentioned this to somebody. I said, “You know, the ambassador was up
                    there reading a book and as soon as he signed the telegram went back to reading
                    the book.” And somebody said to me, “That's his style. He doesn't get involved.
                    He counts on us to know our jobs and to attend to them. His style is, if you
                    need help, he will get involved. When his help is no longer necessary, if you
                    let him know that, he will get uninvolved. He is depending on his staff to be
                    professional enough to carry off its job on its own.” I thought, “Well, that's a
                    pretty good boss to have. He will backstop you if you need but he is not going
                    to interfere in something if it is unnecessary. He saves his heavy ammunition
                    for the big battles.” So, I admired that very much in Johnson.</p>
                <p>My work during those three years in the embassy involved three things. My work
                    was liaison with the ministry of foreign affairs. There was not very much
                    English spoken outside the ministry of foreign affairs in Japan in those days
                    except in the very small international community and I did not know Japanese. I
                    had the hope when I went there that I would be able to develop capability in
                    Japanese since I also knew Chinese very well. That is to say, the written
                    language should not have presented much difficulty for me. If I could learn the
                    spoken language reasonably well then I hoped to be able to develop a capability
                    in the written language also. So, I took the 100 hour intensive course in spoken
                    Japanese that they used to offer in the embassy. After that it was up to me to
                    take an occasional lesson. The short of it is, I never developed a spoken
                    Japanese capability. There was so much work to do that I simply could not find
                    the time or the energy to invest in the homework that I had to do in order to
                    develop a capability in spoken Japanese. That was a disappointment for me that I
                    wasn't able to do it. People told me that wasn't unusual because it is a very
                    difficult language and I certainly believe them after that experience. But, as a
                    result I was restricted pretty much to the diplomatic community and the ministry
                    of foreign affairs as far as my work was concerned with Japan at that time.</p>
                <p>Our policy at that point was to make the Japanese as fully our partners in
                    diplomacy as the British were. That was the slogan. In other words, we shared
                    everything with the Japanese. This was just the beginning of that period. So,
                    every day I would look over the incoming traffic and the telegrams to see what
                    issues we had internationally in the world at large that we wanted to tell the
                    Japanese about. We wanted them to know our position. It was not necessarily
                    issues that related directly to Japanese interests or U.S. interests. It would
                    extend to matters that involved our global interests and the whole broad scheme
                    of international affairs.</p>
                <p>For example. I cultivated the head of the Middle East desk and would go over and
                    talk to them about what we were doing in the Middle East, what was going on, and
                    what the Japanese assessment of developments in the Middle East might be. The
                    Arab-Israeli war of 1967 had just taken place and how did the Japanese see this
                    situation and how we saw the situation, etc. The same thing with Africa and to
                    some extent with Latin America, and, of course, particularly with regard to
                    China and Southeast Asia. Herbert Levin was also in that section and he was a
                    China specialist and during my time there mainly handled China issues with the
                    Japanese.</p>
                <pb facs="0133" n="Page0133"/>
                <p>Another issue that was going on was the non-proliferation treaty (NPT) at the
                    time. I spent a lot of time talking with the people in the arms control part of
                    the foreign ministry about this treaty and what we were doing and trying to
                    persuade them that Japan should become a signatory of the NPT. There was
                    resistance on the part of Japan at that time to adhere to the NPT. The question
                    being raised, particularly on the political right, in Japan was that by adhering
                    to the treaty the Japanese were giving up a nuclear option. They were
                    sacrificing something that would be important to their national interests. This
                    was the argument that was being made in political circles in Japan against
                    adherence to the non-proliferation treaty. But, I think the real reservation on
                    the part of the Japanese was that they were sympathetic to the argument of the
                    third world countries which was, “well all right, if we are going to forswear
                    the position and development of nuclear weapons there has to be some progress on
                    the part of the nuclear weapons powers towards nuclear disarmament.” The
                    Japanese as a result, became active in the subsequent modification of the draft
                    non-proliferation treaty to impose that obligation in the convention upon the
                    major nuclear powers the U.S., France, Russia and the UK. So, that was really
                    the point. I can't remember specifically any conversation where this was made
                    explicit to us, there may have been. Herb and I were both doing this work with
                    liaison with the foreign ministry. But, certainly, and I am sure I did some
                    reporting at the time or Herb and I did together, that made it very clear that
                    this should be inferred from what the Japanese were saying to us and that indeed
                    that did represent their bottom line position in regard to the NPT.</p>
                <p>There were a couple of other things that I worked on at the time. One of them was
                    the Micronesian claims settlement. The Japanese we claimed owed the
                    Micronesians, a trust territory administered by the United States at that time,
                    $10 million in reparations for the loses the Micronesians had sustained of
                    various kinds during the pacific war. These negotiations had been going on for
                    15 years and there had been two previous rounds in these negotiations. For some
                    reason or other, in 1968, the Johnson administration decided that they were
                    going to settle the Micronesian claims issue with the Japanese. In November,
                    after Johnson decided he was not going to run for reelection he busied himself
                    with cleaning off his desk and tidying things up and this was one of the undone
                    tasks that had come down to the State Department from the White House.</p>
                <pb facs="0134" n="Page0134"/>
                <p>So, off I went to the ministry of foreign affairs having been designated as
                    hitter on this issue. I went to the American desk and said that we are going to
                    want to settle the Micronesian claims with you folks. They said, “Oh, we are not
                    so sure we want to do that because we don't agree with your point of view.” I
                    said, “Well, I have instructions that we are going to bring this up and you are
                    going to be seeing me about that.” They said, “Okay. And you realize that you
                    are bringing this up just at the end of the year and we are going to go on New
                    Year's holidays when everything shuts down around here. So nothing is going to
                    get done.” I said, “I realize that, but they don't realize that in Washington
                    and I will let them know.” Not only that, but New Year's holidays in Japan is
                    preceded by Christmas holidays in the U.S. so we could count on at least two
                    weeks of time out during this crucial period when this unsettled issue was to be
                    resolved quickly. The Japanese said, “Okay,” and we agreed on a date that we
                    would have these negotiations.</p>
                <p>Washington deployed Steven Schwebel, who was then in the legal advisor's office,
                    to come out to Japan and conduct these negotiations. Steve came along with his
                    briefcase full of briefing papers and we set up an initial session at the
                    foreign ministry. They provided the room for negotiations and we went over there
                    and Steve made his initial pitch. I can still recall him saying, “We have this
                    proposal for you. We think it is a fair proposal and we not only hope you will
                    agree to it, but we believe you should agree to it.” They listened to us very
                    respectfully and then asked a whole bunch of questions. Then I guess there was
                    the usual ceremonial protocol lunch or dinner that evening. Something that Steve
                    consumed somewhere along the line gave him a terrible case of intestinal flu. He
                    was not able to make it out of his hotel room over to the ministry of foreign
                    affairs. Here these negotiations were on-going and he was incapacitated. I
                    explained this to our counterparts in the foreign ministry who asked how we were
                    going to get this thing going. I said, “Well, the man can't come. He's sick.” I
                    ended up doing shuttle diplomacy between Steve's hotel room where he was
                    confined with diarrhea, comparing notes with him and carrying them back to the
                    ministry of foreign affairs and talking to people on the American affairs desk.
                    It was even to the point where Steve needed a typewriter to type up telegrams,
                    notes, etc., so I ended up taking my portable Olympia typewriter over to Steve's
                    hotel room for his use.</p>
                <pb facs="0135" n="Page0135"/>
                <p>By the end of the week he recovered enough that we could resume negotiations with
                    the Japanese. These negotiations were taking place in January during the last
                    week of the Johnson administration. It was really a bizarre scene. We had to get
                    circular 125 agreement on the draft agreement. We finally did negotiate
                    something that would be accepted by the Japanese and we had to get Washington to
                    agree to it. We had to get that before noon, January 20, 1969, when Johnson's
                    term as president would formally expire. We came right down to the wire on that.
                    Steve and I were in the embassy in Tokyo at 10 o'clock and 11 o'clock at night
                    on the 20th of January as noontime was approaching in Washington, DC carrying
                    out the discussions by telephone. Steve was on one phone talking to Washington
                    and I was on the other phone talking to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. We were
                    going back and forth trying to settle on final wording so that we could get
                    mutual agreement on both sides that this would be the shape of the Micronesian
                    claims settlement. We managed to do it with, I think, five minutes to spare. We
                    got both parties to agree and we initiated the agreement and later on we got
                    circular 125 authority. I'm not quite sure when that came in. It is a very minor
                    chapter in U.S.-Japan relations but it is one of those bizarre things that
                    happen.</p>
                <p>The Japanese did agree to pay $10 million, although they really didn't like doing
                    it. They stonewalled on this all the way through. We had to drag them. The
                    Ministry of Foreign Affairs got caught between the U.S. embassy and the Ministry
                    of Finance. The Ministry of Finance simply did not want to cough up the $10
                    million at all. They saw no justification for it and the Ministry of Finance is
                    all-powerful in Japan. My counterpart, Kazuo Chiba, who is a very good friend of
                    mine, who I just saw again last August in Japan, was head of the American desk
                    and a very able diplomat. Finally, when he got the Ministry of Finance to agree
                    and called me to notify me of this, he blew up on the phone. He completely lost
                    it and scolded me in the most scathing terms for the way we acted in these
                    negotiations and all the rest. I did not reply in kind. I said to him, “I
                    understand, Kaz, what you are saying. I appreciate what you have done and I know
                    it has been difficult.” I think he just hung up. He was angry, frustrated,
                    tired, beaten, bruised and everything else. We never talked about that again. It
                    is not his style and it is not the kind of thing we would do in our
                    relationship. But, I remember very clearly that being a hard fought agreement to
                    bring about.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the Japanese Foreign Service
                        anforeign ministry?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0136" n="Page0136"/>
                <p>CUNNINGHAM: They were super. I never worked harder in my life then I worked in
                    Tokyo. At the end of three years I was very tired. But in all of these
                    comparisons of batting order that we used to make about international affairs
                    every day when I go over to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, I never told them
                    anything new that they didn't already know. They knew everything just as quickly
                    as we did. We had different understandings and interpretations and they and we
                    were both interested in knowing what each other thought about any issue at hand.
                    We were kind of confirming each other's analyses and confirming the details with
                    one another. At the end of one of these conversations, I would go back and
                    report to Washington what the Japanese had told me. In other words, it was
                    another perspective on that particular issue. I never surprised them and I'm
                    happy to say they never surprised us either in any of these exchanges, but we
                    always learned something from one another. I came to respect the Ministry of
                    Foreign Affairs very, very highly.</p>
                <p>The quality of the diplomatic corps in Tokyo was absolutely first class. We had
                    world class people in all the embassies there. It was a real privilege to work
                    with people in the German embassy, the British embassy, the French and all the
                    rest and even the Soviet embassy, with whom we worked from time to time. They
                    were knowledgeable, able people who were first rate diplomats. So, you get to be
                    a good player by playing with the champions, and it was a great opportunity for
                    me to work in that embassy.</p>
                <p>We should talk about Three other things that happened during this period of time.
                    1.) The meeting of the Universal Postal Union (UPU), for which I was deployed,
                    had nothing to do with Japan but with South Africa; 2.) the hijacking of a
                    Japanese airliner to Korea; and 3.) ping pong diplomacy in which I was involved
                    in 1971, and how that fit into the whole business of China-Japan relations
                    during that time.</p>
                <p>The Universal Postal Union meets every five years in a different country. This is
                    a meeting of postmasters from all over the world to discuss the size and shape
                    of envelopes for international standardization and things of that kind. They
                    meet for six or seven weeks. It is a grand extravaganza. Japan was the host
                    country for this meeting in 1970. This was a different period in Japan's postwar
                    development. The Japanese were trying to reestablish themselves in the
                    international order. In the 1960s they had embarked upon Ikeda's double your
                    income policy and that was when the gross domestic product of Japan grew
                    phenomenally and they became major exporters of consumer and other goods. There
                    was also the period of the Olympics in Japan and Expo 70. All of these were
                    carefully planned and programmed events to restore Japan to a position as a
                    respectable member of the international community in all ways. Inviting the
                    Universal Postal Union, one of the oldest intergovernmental organizations, to
                    meet in Japan in Tokyo was another of these moves.</p>
                <pb facs="0137" n="Page0137"/>
                <p>One day in the fall of 1970 we received in the embassy an airgram instruction, a
                    fairly low level communication at that point, saying the Universal Postal Union
                    would be meeting in Tokyo on such-and-such a date and that the Department
                    understood there was going to be a move to expel South Africa and Portugal from
                    the UPU. A delegation would be coming out composed of people from the postal
                    department along with an attorney contracted to the legal affairs office in the
                    Department of State. No, formal State Department people in the delegation. We
                    were to monitor moves to expel South Africa and/or Portugal from the UPU and
                    report. The instructions came to me because I'm the guy handling external
                    affairs in the embassy. I read this thing and said okay.</p>
                <p>When the delegation came in, either someone from them contacted the embassy or I
                    went over and contacted somebody at the Tokyo Prince Hotel where they were
                    staying. I said that I was a State Department guy and if you hear anything about
                    this, let me know so that I can report to Washington and they agreed. I think
                    there was a Japanese holiday so nothing happened and they went off on a long
                    weekend. When they got back Sunday night they found a draft resolution had been
                    circulated to all delegations by, I think, Senegal, but I'm not sure. The draft
                    called for expulsion of South Africa and Portugal from the Universal Postal
                    Union in retaliation for the policies of apartheid in South Africa and the
                    colonial and imperialist policies of Portugal in its African colonies,
                    Mozambique and Angola.</p>
                <p>I was notified of this and in fact called over to the hotel. There was a group of
                    agitated representatives from places like New Zealand, Australia, etc. who said
                    to me, “Well, what are you going to do?” I said, “Well, I will report this to
                    Washington. Those are my instructions.” “Well, what are you going to do?” I
                    said, “My instructions are not to do anything but report.” They said, “But, you
                    are the leader of the free world, the United States, what are you going to do?”
                    I said, “I will report it.”</p>
                <p>So, I reported this thing to Washington. The next morning I was over at the hotel
                    where the conference was taking place and was called out of a meeting for a
                    phone call. It was from a guy, either director or deputy director of the UN
                    political office in IO (International Organizations) who said to me, “We got
                    your telegram and we want you to oppose this resolution.” I said, “That is not
                    what the instructions that came out from Washington said. We were told not to
                    get out in front on this if it arises but simply to report and I reported.” This
                    guy said, “No, you are to oppose this initiative.” I said, “But, I have work to
                    do here in the embassy. Why don't you contact the delegation?” “They don't know
                    how to oppose this initiative. So, you are to oppose this initiative.” I said,
                    “You are telling me to go out in front?” He said, “Yes, I'm telling you to go
                    out in front.” I said, “You had better send out a telegram to that effect
                    because so far as the embassy is concerned I'm just here as a part time observer
                    to report to you what is going on.” He said, “Don't worry about that, we will
                    take care of it.”</p>
                <pb facs="0138" n="Page0138"/>
                <p>I went back to the meeting and said to the delegation that we were to oppose the
                    initiative. They all looked at me and said, “How do we do that?” Well, thank
                    God, I had been in 1964 deployed by the Department of State as a liaison officer
                    to the U.S. mission to the UN during the period of the General Assembly on
                    behalf of the Bureau of East Asian Affairs. So, I had learned from that
                    experience what you have to do in multilateral diplomacy in UN affairs to go
                    about organizing a position on a resolution. So, I set to work to do so. I guess
                    I set up operations in the offices of the delegation in its quarters over at the
                    hotel and worked much of the time from there. For six or seven weeks I was not
                    in the embassy but with this delegation fighting tooth and nail to keep South
                    Africa and Portugal in the UPU. What I did, using my position in the embassy as
                    first secretary, was to energize the whole diplomatic corps in Tokyo to rally
                    around this cause and back us in the Universal Postal Union because most of the
                    delegations did not have professional diplomats with them either. So, I got all
                    of my colleagues in the diplomatic corps involved in this thing.</p>
                <p>The first thing we did was to circulate a resolution saying there aren't going to
                    be any political discussions in the Universal Postal Union. Well, the resolution
                    passed but didn't make a damn bit of difference. The non-aligned movement went
                    right ahead with a resolution to expel South Africa from the UPU. We went to the
                    chairman, who was Japanese, and said, “Mr. Chairman, you have to rule this
                    resolution out of order because general council has already adopted a resolution
                    saying there won't be any discussion of political matters.” The chairman was not
                    going to act independently on this and said that he would have to consult the
                    Foreign Ministry and would give full consideration of our position on this
                    matter. We said, “Please do.” Then we went to work on the Foreign Ministry to
                    try to get them to turn the chairman around. Well, the chairman, of course, came
                    from the Postal Ministry and not from the Foreign Ministry.</p>
                <p>The chairman was reluctant to go out on a limb on this kind of thing and the
                    Foreign Ministry was reluctant to jeopardize its relationships with a group of
                    non-aligned countries for the sake of supporting the U.S. on the questionable
                    issue of South Africa's status because of apartheid, etc. I guess they didn't
                    have enough at stake in regard to South Africa to weigh in the balance against
                    their relationships with all the non-aligned countries. And, of course, I think
                    a lot of the other countries were putting pressure on the Foreign Ministry as
                    well to go along with admitting this resolution to debate and discussion.</p>
                <p>Well, the upshot was that the chairman did not rule the resolution out of order.
                    So then we were launched on a debate that took over the proceedings of the UPU
                    for the rest of the seven weeks. It came up, then was sent into committee, came
                    up again and sent again into committee, so I was constantly on the run
                    monitoring this thing. Finally, it came to a vote and by one vote the general
                    council voted to expel South Africa from the UPU. I worked as intensively as I
                    could for two days, full time, leading up to this thing lobbying delegations
                    right and left and sending off telegrams to capitals, etc. but to no avail. The
                    resolution passed by a margin of one. I think that the issue of Portugal was
                    split off and Portugal was reprimanded but not expelled.</p>
                <pb facs="0139" n="Page0139"/>
                <p>There was a lot of recrimination over this even in the ensuing sessions after the
                    whole thing was over. It dragged on almost down to the end and took a great deal
                    of my time. It had nothing to do with my regular work in the embassy. There was
                    one instance when a key vote went against us (whether or not to require a
                    two-thirds vote on the resolution) in this process and I had counted every vote
                    very carefully and checked with all kinds of people and I was able, I felt, to
                    account for every vote, but we lost by one vote and a simple majority was
                    sufficient to pass the resolution. I was really peeved by that. I checked all of
                    my tallies and all of the research that I had done and by process of elimination
                    I concluded that it was the French who had switched and voted against us. I
                    shared this with a few other delegations, most particularly my very good friend,
                    Klaus Blech, who was the counselor of the German embassy at the time. I did that
                    deliberately because I believed that it would get back to the French at some
                    point, and it did. A French diplomat came to me protesting right and left that
                    they of course supported our position and would not do otherwise under any
                    circumstances. I felt they were protesting far too much, so I think my analysis
                    was right, although I can't prove it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The votes were secret?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNNINGHAM: Yes, I think they were secret. That was an interestinexperience.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the other points that you were dealing
                        with?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNNINGHAM: One of the two issues that we probably should mention was the
                    hijacking of a Japanese domestic passenger flight to Seoul, Korea. Such a thing
                    had not happened in Japan before. I think it was a flight going to Kyushu. I
                    have forgotten who the perpetrator was but this was at a time when
                    Japanese-Korean relations were not of the best. They had established diplomatic
                    relations but against a background of Japan's colonialism in Korea, which the
                    Koreans were very bitter about. And, now, all of a sudden a Japanese domestic
                    flight had been hijacked to Korea by parties unknown. The Japanese had to rely
                    on the Koreans to rectify the situation, capture the perpetrator, whoever he or
                    she was. As it turned out I think it was a Japanese national, but I am not sure
                    now.</p>
                <pb facs="0140" n="Page0140"/>
                <p>In any case, our concern in that was that there were a couple of Americans on
                    board this plane and there was some threat that the plane might be taken to
                    North Korea. This was not long after the Pueblo incident and we certainly didn't
                    need another American hostage in North Korea at that point. So, I spent a lot of
                    time when this happened working with the ministry of foreign affairs, and I have
                    forgotten when this was, I think it was in 1970, to the extent that we could and
                    the Korean embassy and then just monitoring the thing on Japanese television.
                    After its landing, there were Japanese television cameras trained on this
                    aircraft, 24 hours a day broadcasting live on Japanese television. Really one of
                    the most boring experiences that I ever had was watching nothing happening on
                    the tarmac while negotiations went on some place in regard to the release of the
                    passengers on the plane. It could have been a very volatile incident turning out
                    badly, but happily it turned out all right. So, this was something that occupied
                    a lot of my time for a few days.</p>
                <p>I was not involved in the Okinawa negotiations at all. A special section was set
                    up in the embassy to handle that. Charles A. (Chuck) Schmitz was the head of
                    that section and he had two or three other people who were working with him and
                    people were deployed out of Washington from time to time. It was a high point of
                    the period.</p>
                <p>During this period of time, also of significance in the Japan of 1970, was that
                    the security treaty at that point became eligible for repudiation by either
                    party on one year's notice. When it had been drafted in 1960, there was a
                    10-year period when it could not be repudiated and then after that could be
                    repudiated by either side. There were demonstrations outside the American
                    embassy nightly during the time that the Diet was in session. And, also outside
                    the Diet. Also, on weekends throughout Tokyo. The students were trying to
                    persuade the Japanese government to repudiate the treaty. The American embassy
                    every evening for weeks was surrounded by Japanese security police with their
                    protective gear on and the big shields that they used to prevent the
                    demonstrators from intruding upon the American embassy compound. All of these
                    things seemed to be somewhat scripted because the demonstrators would snake
                    dance up the hill to the street in front of the embassy and then circulate
                    around and snake dance back down again. They would come within six inches of the
                    police but never touch them.</p>
                <p>This was at the time when the Japanese police developed a technique that many
                    other police forces have since adopted. By then the minicam had been invented,
                    so the Japanese police equipped a lot of people with minicams to run along right
                    behind this phalanx of Japanese security police and photograph all of the
                    demonstrators on the other side of the line as they snake danced pass. The
                    police then would then try to use the film as evidence to arrest them later on.
                    Then the demonstrators took to wearing masks disguising themselves so that they
                    could not be photographed. It was all fascinating to watch play out.</p>
                <pb facs="0141" n="Page0141"/>
                <p>Going home from work I would go out the back entrance to the embassy and walk
                    through back alleys to my home, while the whole thing was taking place down the
                    street in front of the embassy. Tokyo was perfectly secure. My parents and
                    friends back home reading about these massive demonstrations that were going on
                    around the American embassy thought that I was in dire peril, but nothing of the
                    kind was happening.</p>
                <p>This was also the period when the student uprisings on the campuses began and the
                    campus of Tokyo University and several others were taken over by students for a
                    time. It was kind of a replication of the student movement that erupted in the
                    United States as a result of the Vietnam War. There was a certain amount of
                    anti-Vietnam protesting and protesting against the rigidities of the Japanese
                    education system that were important abackground to these student movements.
                    There are two people who you should interview if you haven't done so already
                    about the domestic politics of Japan at that time and implications for relations
                    with the U.S. Those are Francis McNeil, who is a Japan specialist, and who I
                    think lives somewhere around Washington, DC.</p>
                <p>Q: I have interviewed Frank but I can't remember how far we got because he sort
                    of drifted away. I think he is up in New Haven now. I will go looking for
                    him.</p>
                <p>CUNNINGHAM: And Robert Immerman, who is adjunct professor at Columbia and also at
                    a university in Japan. He rotates on a regular basis between Japan and New York
                    giving courses in both places. Bob is a superb analyst of Japan. With regards to
                    that movement in the domestic politics of the time, those are two guys I would
                    recommend very, very highly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Perhaps I can get him to come down to Washington for an
                        interview.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNNINGHAM: Bill Sherman is someone else who lives in NortherVirginia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I have interviewed Bill.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNNINGHAM: Good. And Rodney Armstrong, who is no longer in the Foreign Service,
                    he is a Washington lobbyist, was in the embassy at that time. Rod is to some
                    extent conversant with the domestic politics.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where is he now?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNNINGHAM: Well, last time I heard he was a lobbyist for Toyota iWashington.</p>
                <pb facs="0142" n="Page0142"/>
                <p>Q: Bill, you mentioned there were two more subjects you wanted to talk about on
                    Japan. One was Ambassador Armin Meyer and the other was ping pong diplomacy.</p>
                <p>CUNNINGHAM: Yes. In November, 1968, Richard Nixon was elected president and soon
                    thereafter he chose U. Alexis Johnson, who was currently ambassador to Japan, to
                    become the under secretary of state for political affairs, which at that time
                    was the top foreign service job in the Department of State. So, Johnson left.
                    There is a little story about that too, which should perhaps be mentioned here
                    and I don't know whether it is true or not. Since both of the gentlemen are
                    dead, there is no way of telling, but I heard this story. Marshall Green, who
                    was then assistant secretary for East Asian affairs, wanted the job of
                    ambassador to Japan, and he was U. Alexis Johnson's first choice to be his
                    successor in Tokyo. Some time in late December or early January, before Johnson
                    had left Tokyo to go back to Washington for hearings and to take up his new job,
                    Marshall Green headed out to East Asia on a visit to Vietnam. He did not make a
                    visit to Japan on that trip, but he stopped at Haneda airport for refueling or
                    change of planes or something like that. As a courtesy he called Johnson from
                    the airport. Johnson took the call and was glad to hear from Marshall, the two
                    men knew one another very well. Johnson was waiting for Green to tell him that
                    Green would like the job as Johnson's successor. Green did not bring this up in
                    their telephone conversation. Johnson rather expected that the phone
                    conversation would be about that. Since, Green did not bring it up, Johnson
                    thought with the big change in Washington Green has gotten a better offer from
                    the administration or somewhere else and probably was not at liberty to say
                    anything about it. Therefore, Johnson did not mention the Ambassadorial post to
                    Green, thinking that he had chosen something else and wasn't able to talk about
                    it yet.</p>
                <p>Green, on the other hand, did want to be Ambassador to Japan. He was waiting for
                    Johnson to raise the subject. Green didn't want to put Johnson in an awkward
                    position by raising the subject himself, so he waited for Johnson to bring it
                    up. When Johnson did not do so, Green assumed that either someone else had been
                    chosen or that Johnson was in favor of someone else for the job.</p>
                <p>So, the telephone conversation went on very cordially and politely and neither
                    man mentioned this question of who was going to be Johnson's successor in Tokyo.
                    Green's flight was called, and he hung up and went on his way.</p>
                <p>From there on I don't know how things developed, except I understand there was a
                    list of 20 people who were asked whether they would want to be ambassador to
                    Japan and Armin Meyer was the 20th and all the other 19 said no or had something
                    else, etc.</p>
                <pb facs="0143" n="Page0143"/>
                <p>It is also interesting that just at that time the trade balance between the U.S.
                    and Japan turned around and Armin Meyer became ambassador to Japan in the year
                    when we first went into a negative trade balance with the Japanese. The issue at
                    the time was textiles. Nixon had made a promise to the textile industries in the
                    South that he would make sure that they were protected against imports of
                    foreign textiles. Prime Minister Sato made a visit to Washington soon after the
                    inauguration and Nixon brought the matter up. James Wickel, who was our senior
                    interpreter in the American embassy, a man of unparalleled knowledge of the
                    Japanese language, nuances and inferences, etc., was present in the room where
                    this conversation took place. Nixon said to Sato, who did not speak English, “I
                    have this terrible problem with the textile producers in the South, and I have
                    to protect them. Textile imports from Japan are very large and Mr. Prime
                    Minister you have to do something about this.” Sato was one of the most
                    enigmatic of the post war Japanese prime ministers and he said in Japanese, “I
                    will adopt a forward looking position towards this matter.” Nixon got the
                    impression from this statement that Sato had committed himself to restraining
                    textile imports from Japan. Sato did not intend to convey that impression at all
                    because he knew it would be a delicate and political matter back home. What he
                    was simply saying, according to the Japanese and Jim Wickel, is “I hear your
                    message, Mr. President,” and nothing beyond that.</p>
                <p>The two went away from the meeting separately with very different understandings
                    of what had transpired between them. Later on this conversation was revisited by
                    both sides, but by that time Nixon felt he was being double-crossed by the
                    Japanese and when Nixon got that kind of idea there really wasn't much you could
                    do to redeem yourself. Sato, on the other hand, was having to defend himself
                    from attacks from the Diet as a result of things that were coming out of
                    Washington over the trade balance question.</p>
                <p>Sato, was famous for making statements of all kinds that were subject to many
                    different interpretations and it was common in the American embassy after Sato
                    had made an important statement in the Diet for all of our Japanese language
                    experts, including Jim Wickel, to sit down and pore over this statement and try
                    to figure out what Sato really meant because it sounded like he meant one thing
                    but it could mean that he meant something else. Then they would consult with
                    political circles in Japan and with Sato's interpreters. Sato's statements
                    always left a great deal of vagueness in the atmosphere and, of course, left him
                    a lot of latitude.</p>
                <pb facs="0144" n="Page0144"/>
                <p>Armin Meyer was a big change in the style of the American embassy in comparison
                    to U. Alexis Johnson. Meyer had never been in East Asia at all. He was an
                    Arabist and Middle East expert, and evidently a very good one. His personal
                    style was entirely different. Whereas U. Alexis Johnson's style was “you guys
                    take care of things, you are professionals, let me know if you need me,” Armin
                    Meyer was an activist and wanted to get into everything. Coming from the Middle
                    East where if you want something done you see the King of Jordan, or the Shah of
                    Iran or somebody else who is a maximum leader and tell them what your problem is
                    and the matter is taken of, Meyer had great difficulty understanding the
                    Japanese system, which does not work that way at all. Formally, in structural
                    terms from the outside it looks as though it ought to work the way formal
                    hierarchical systems do. But the Japanese system of governing is difficult to
                    understand, and definitely more difficult to know how to influence than most.
                    When Washington started giving Meyer a lot of heat about the trade balance, he
                    figured he should go and talk to the emperor. This would have been absolutely
                    useless and embarrassing to all sides concerned had he done it. He had to be
                    dissuaded from this.</p>
                <p>Armin Meyer was not an easy person to dissuade once he got the idea that
                    something had to be a certain way. He was vocally, militantly anti-Communist. He
                    had a very doctrinaire manner about things. He polarized the embassy soon after
                    he got there. His style clashed directly with the way things are done in Japan,
                    which is by hint, inference, nuance, by being somewhat indirect and conscious of
                    face, etc. Armin Meyer's style did not fit with that at all. He really set the
                    teeth on edge of most people who had to deal with him on a daily basis. I must
                    say also that his wife added to this impression very much because she was a
                    staunch defender of Ambassador Meyer. She was vocal about how the ambassador had
                    the right answer to everything and very conscious of her position as the first
                    lady of the American embassy and community and wanted to make certain nobody had
                    any mistake about that at all. This did not endear her to anybody in the
                    official diplomatic community there. In fact, a lot of people just went out of
                    their way to avoid her all together if they possibly could.</p>
                <p>The thing about Meyer that interested me very much was his enigmatic personality.
                    He would make the most outrageous kinds of statements in the privacy of his
                    office, in the privacy of his bubble, where we held the senior staff meetings in
                    the embassy. “I am going to speak to the Japanese Press Club next week and tell
                    such-and-such.” People would be just horrified at what Armin Meyer wanted to say
                    publicly to the Japanese. They would hold their heads, wring their hands. It
                    fell to Bill Sherman as political counselor most of the time, and to Dick
                    Sneider the rest of the time I think, to go and say to the ambassador, “Now,
                    this isn't the way it is done in Japan.” Sneider, somehow or other managed to
                    survive this experience in reasonably good fashion, but Bill Sherman to this day
                    can not think of Armin Meyer without his stomach turning over. The memory is
                    really anathema to Bill.</p>
                <pb facs="0145" n="Page0145"/>
                <p>I was not that much directly involved with Armin Meyer because he didn't deal a
                    great deal with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. I didn't have to worry much
                    about him but would get the ricochets from his actions and statements from all
                    of my colleagues. The interesting thing about Armin Meyer is that in private and
                    in the conference room in the embassy he would make statements about Japan and
                    Japan's policy toward the United States that went completely against the many
                    delicate, and finely balanced precepts of U.S. Japan relations. These statements
                    greatly alarmed his entire staff. But you put Armin Meyer on stage and somehow
                    or either he managed to say exactly the right thing every time. It would come
                    out the right way. Perhaps his blatant adversarial style was a learning method.
                    Armin Meyer did have a very good sense for public relations. His personal
                    persona, however, seemed to be that of Babbitt straight out of Main Street in
                    his behavior, style and speech privately. But, you put him in the diplomatic
                    context where he had to perform and somehow or other he would switch this all
                    around and put it across very smoothly. I saw this happen time and again. Every
                    time this happened my colleagues in the embassy were saying, “I can't figure
                    this out. How did that come about?” They were not able to comprehend whatever it
                    was and I can't either, the transformation in Armin Meyer. Maybe it was that he
                    was just letting off steam in the privacy of the embassy, steeling himself to do
                    what he personally did not want to do but knew he had to do because he was the
                    American ambassador and a career diplomat.</p>
                <p>The other thing about Armin Meyer is that he took extremely good care of
                    congressional delegations and political visitors of all kinds. Anytime there was
                    a CODEL coming in that was a major event so far as Armin Meyer was concerned. It
                    was more important than the way we treated any minister of the Japanese cabinet.
                    He made sure that everything went just right for them. That built him very
                    strong relationships in Washington, DC.</p>
                <p>I got along all right with Meyer and in fact he gave me a meritorious service
                    award for my work on the Universal Postal Union. I was quite surprised that he
                    did that. He congratulated me on it. I said, “Well, I didn't succeed, Mr.
                    Ambassador, we lost by one vote.” He said, “I know it is tough to lose those
                    votes, but you worked awfully hard and did a good job with what you had to work
                    with and you deserve this award.” I felt that was very generous of him and was
                    it nothing that I anticipated whatsoever. Somehow or other I seemed to get along
                    with him all right. I don't in anyway discount or deprecate the work of my
                    colleagues in the American embassy. It was just one of those things where for
                    unknown reasons the chemistry worked for me with Armin Meyer, although I was on
                    edge a lot of the time dealing with him as well.</p>
                <pb facs="0146" n="Page0146"/>
                <p>Now, to come to ping pong diplomacy. This background of Meyer's personality and
                    behavior is part of the story. In the fall of 1970 it became obvious that U.S.
                    policy was on the slippery slope so far as maintaining the representation of the
                    Republic of China in the UN General Assembly. The end was visible, particularly
                    to me because of all the time I had spent working on this matter six and seven
                    years previously when I was on the Republic of China desk. We prevailed in the
                    general assembly 1970 by a very narrow margin, but the tide had been running
                    against it for some years and this was visible evidence that it was going to
                    shift. So, we and the Japanese began consulting on this. In fact, the U.S. began
                    consulting with a lot of people in various places very quietly about what shall
                    we do, what is our fallback, what are the alternatives? Should the Republic of
                    China be encouraged to resign from the United Nations thereby removing China all
                    together from the language of the United Nations and entitlement to a seat on
                    the Security Council as a permanent member? All kinds of scenarios were
                    discussed. Even the scenario of a two China solution of some kind, which was
                    anathema to Taipei. We had a number of rehearsals of this with the ministry of
                    foreign affairs in Tokyo and several conferences. Some people came out from
                    Washington to conduct a roundtable discussion of some kind, a bull session with
                    the foreign ministry along about February or March 1971.</p>
                <p>Also, coincidentally, during that time, I made a month long trip in January to
                    Australia. The International Congress of Orientalists was holding a meeting in
                    Canberra, Australia. This is a conclave of all the people who specialize in
                    Asian studies from all around the world. It is a venerable organization that
                    goes back to the 19th century. I had attended a session of the Congress that was
                    the first one to be held in the United States at the University of Michigan in
                    1967, when I was at Columbia. I thought this was a neat organization, they were
                    meeting in Canberra, and I had never been to Australia. I decided that I would
                    like to attend the Congress and present a paper on the manuscript that I had
                    done while at Columbia University on sabbatical in 1967. My topic was Chinese
                    Communist Party attitudes towards the United Nations up until the time of
                    liberation in 1949 and the Security Council vote on Korea in December 1950. My
                    proposal was accepted. I got a conference rate on an airline ticket and worked
                    out a lot of things and flew to Canberra about January 3. I also wanted to take
                    advantage of this trip to visit other places in Southeast Asia and was gone
                    about a month. I went to the Philippines, where I had never been, Papua New
                    Guinea, Indonesia, etc.</p>
                <pb facs="0147" n="Page0147"/>
                <p>Two interesting things happened on that trip. One was when I presented my paper
                    at Canberra. We knew from Foreign Service reporting that the Romanian consul
                    general in Sydney at that time was a well-known China specialist who had served
                    in Beijing. We were interested in his views of what was going on in China.
                    Romania was one of the countries that Nixon was cultivating and thinking about
                    using as a channel to China, although none of us knew that at the time. It
                    turned out that this consul general's wife was in the audience when I gave my
                    paper and she had been with him when he was in Beijing and was to some extent a
                    China scholar in her own right. She was interested in my paper and we had a
                    little conversation about it afterwards. She and some others were interested in
                    whether or not this was some kind of a signal that we were sending to the
                    Chinese, since it was the first secretary from the American embassy in Tokyo who
                    was presenting the paper? Well, it was no signal, but on the other hand since I
                    was a China watcher and specialist, I was not averse to taking advantage of any
                    opportunity that came along to use my little paper as a vehicle for having
                    broader discussions about China. The Romanian lady invited me to visit her and
                    her husband in Sydney after the Congress. When I got to Sydney, I called the
                    Romanian Consulate, but I was not able to make contact with the Consul General
                    or his wife, so no conversation ensued.</p>
                <p>On the way back to Tokyo from that conference I stopped in Taipei. Walter
                    McConaughy was the American ambassador to the Republic of China at that time and
                    Bill Thomas was the DCM. I went around to the Foreign Ministry to see my old
                    friend, Yang His-k'un, the Vice Minister who had for so long worked so hard in
                    Africa for so long to retain support for China's representation in the United
                    Nations. He welcomed me and we had a long conversation in his office, during
                    which he said, “You know, this situation in the General Assembly is a real worry
                    to us and the vote is getting awfully close and we are not quite sure what to
                    do. We have to think of something. You know, if someone at the level of the U.S.
                    vice president [who was Spiro Agnew at the time] could propose or float the idea
                    of two seats for China in the general assembly as a way of addressing the
                    problem that is coming up, that would open up this alternative for discussion
                    here in Taiwan.” I believe that Agnew was to make a visit to Asia a few weeks
                    later, and Yang's idea was that Agnew would raise the idea in the course of his
                    trip. I was quite surprised that Yang made this statement. Of course, he was
                    talking to me as a friend. I was not from the embassy or on any official
                    business. I had just dropped in to see an old friend. We had about a half-hour
                    of conversation.</p>
                <pb facs="0148" n="Page0148"/>
                <p>I immediately went back to the American embassy and saw Bill Thomas and said,
                    “This is what vice minister Yang His-k'un said to me,” and Bill said, “Let's go
                    in and see the ambassador about this.” So, we went into the ambassador's office
                    and he said, “Mr. Ambassador, Bill Cunningham has been over to see his old pal
                    vice minister Yang.” McConaughy knew who I was and said, “Yes. Tell me what he
                    said.” So, I recounted the whole thing. McConaughy said, “We have to report this
                    right away. This is a very important conversation, Bill. I am very glad you came
                    back to tell us about this.” The interesting thing about that was that
                    McConaughy did not resist the idea at all. Now, you know, I've earlier described
                    how we in the China crowd used to speak about the policy of the three
                    Walters—Walter Judd, Walter Robertson and Walter McConaughy —all hard-line
                    supporters of the Nationalists and resolute opponents of the Chinese Communists.
                    So, it was quite surprising to me that Walter McConaughy was receptive to the
                    idea of a two China maneuver in the general assembly as a way of saving the
                    position of the Republic of China in the United Nations and addressing this
                    problem - - surprising because it would mean a radical departure from the
                    official ideology of the Nationalists and entry for the Chinese Communists onto
                    the world stage. .</p>
                <p>So, that telegram went off to the Department of State. I think as a matter of
                    fact Bill Thomas asked me to sit down and dictate it to Sally Smith, his
                    secretary at the time and another able Foreign Service trouper who had served
                    with other China specialists and me from Tokyo to Singapore. I dictated the
                    cable, and then Bill signed off on it. Of course, by the time I got back to
                    Tokyo, everyone in the Embassy everyone was asking questions about what I had
                    been doing being gone a month and then monkeying around in China policy. My
                    answer was that I was just visiting an old friend. After I got back to Tokyo
                    people came out from Washington and the buzz was what are we going to do about
                    China in the United Nations, etc. So, that was what I was focusing on.This
                    brings us to the 7th of April 1971. Three o'clock in the afternoon I am sitting
                    in my office when the phone rings. It is a telephone call from Frank Donovan,
                    now deceased, who was the press officer in USIS. Donovan said to me, “Bill, the
                    Italian press agency has just moved the story to the effect that the PRC table
                    tennis team playing in the international matches in Nagoya has invited the U.S.
                    table tennis team to visit China.” I said, “Yes.” Frank said, “Well, we are
                    going to be asked about this. What should we say?” I said, “Frank, just tell
                    them we know about it.” He said, “That is not enough. We've got to say more.” By
                    this time something had begun to percolate in my mind and I said, “Okay, Frank,
                    tell them we know about it and that if they decide to go it will not be against
                    United States policy.” I stopped and started to say, “Well, we can elaborate
                    that a little bit.” And Frank said, “That is enough. We don't need to say
                    anymore.” I said, “Okay,” and hung up.</p>
                <pb facs="0149" n="Page0149"/>
                <p>Then I thought to myself, “I better be able to back this up. I know I have seen
                    something in print somewhere to this effect and I think I am sure of my ground.”
                    I started looking around and found in my bookshelf the statement I was looking
                    for. It was in the annual report on the foreign relations of the United States
                    from the President to the Congress. This is a series that Kissinger started up
                    when he was the National Security Advisor, and there are three or four volumes
                    in that series, one for each year of Kissinger's tenure. The Department of State
                    put out a parallel report, a thicker and more detailed report also for each of
                    the same years after the presidential reports started coming out. Well, there in
                    the report of the President to the Congress was the statement that the United
                    States is open to educational, cultural and athletic exchanges with the Peoples
                    Republic of China. Just one sentence to that affect. I thought, there it is.
                    Table tennis is a sport, an athletic event, and we have said that it is okay to
                    have exchanges with them. They have invited the American team, and there is no
                    policy reason why it shouldn't go. I was right. Then, as I further looked at
                    this I thought, “Well, you know, I hadn't really focused on this sentence
                    before.” I then recalled the pheasant egg exchange I spoke of earlier. I thought
                    to myself that my colleagues back there on the mainland China desk in the
                    Department of State have been working away in incremental fashion to develop
                    language that would open the door just a little more to contact with China, and
                    had finally managed to get this short sentence inserted into a high level
                    statement of the U.S. government. This was the sort of thing that the desk would
                    try to do to gradually and more or less below the radar to open up channels and
                    opportunities for communication with the PRC.” That is all I thought it was at
                    the time. I had no knowledge of anything that Henry Kissinger was doing through
                    back channels with Yahya Khan, the president of Pakistan.</p>
                <p>Okay, I had just found this statement and hadn't even sat down at my desk yet
                    when the phone rang again. It was Alan Carter, who was the public affairs
                    officer in Tokyo. Carter said, “Frank told me about his conversation with you
                    and what you said.” I said, “Yes.” Carter said, “Don't you think you have gone
                    awfully far?” I had the text in front of me by now, and I read the sentence to
                    him. He said, “I don't know about that. It has gone very far.” I said, “Alan,
                    this is an official, public statement of United States policy.” By this time I
                    was getting a little bit assertive about this because having found this sentence
                    I couldn't see any basis for the Embassy to issue a statement saying the team
                    can't go or throwing cold water on that. It would be the wrong thing to do and
                    would be denying the validity of a statement of the government and that would
                    send the wrong signal to the Chinese. I said, “I think this is what we should
                    say. Here it is. It's a public statement. How are you going to go against that?”
                    Well”, Carter said to me, “You had better talk to the ambassador.” I said,
                    “Okay, I'll go talk to the ambassador.”</p>
                <pb facs="0150" n="Page0150"/>
                <p>So, I hung up and started out my office down the corridor to the ambassador's
                    office. I walked in and said to his secretary, “Is the ambassador free? I have
                    something I want to ask him about.” She said, “Oh, you might as well go on in,
                    everybody else is in there.” I thought this was a rather strange statement but
                    went on in. The ambassador's office was a room at least 50 feet in length. It
                    had been the formal waiting room when the embassy was built and the secretary's
                    office had been the ambassador's office. But the rooms had been switched around
                    at some point. Ambassador Meyer was standing behind his desk at the far end of
                    the room just hanging up the telephone as I walked in. Seated in a corner to my
                    right on a couch were two full bird colonels of the United States Army, both in
                    full uniform. The two colonels looked up, startled by my bursting into the
                    ambassador's office. They looked at me, then looked at him. I started to say
                    something to the Ambassador and he said, with more than a hint of exasperation
                    in his voice, “All right, go ahead and put out the statement.” I said, “Okay,”
                    and turned to leave the office. As I was going out the door, I heard Meyer
                    almost shou“And, you know what you might do when you put it out is ask why they
                    don't invite the Republic of China too. A bunch of damn Communists.” I said,
                    “Yes, thank you, sir,” walked out, and closed the door.</p>
                <p>I never asked Alan Carter, at least I don't recall asking him, but I assume that
                    I no sooner walked out of my office than Carter called the ambassador to tell
                    him before I got there what was going on. I never had the opportunity at that
                    moment to discuss this matter with Ambassador Meyer at all. Walking down to his
                    office, I must confess that I was a little bit apprehensive about what he might
                    say and how I was going to present this thing to him. So, I was quite taken back
                    by his response.</p>
                <p>Not only that, Meyer's comment about inviting the ROC players to the Mainland
                    reflected an awareness of a controversy in Nagoya over the participation of the
                    Chinese teams in the table tennis championships. The Japanese were hosting this
                    event and the PRC players wanted to attend, and I recently have found out that
                    the Japanese wanted the PRC to attend because the Chinese were the world
                    champions, and if they didn't attend the matches would be a dud. Again, this was
                    1971 and the Japanese were trying to promote their position internationally and
                    they did not want to have a table tennis match that was going to be a flop,
                    meaningless because the world champions were not present. So, they had made a
                    demarche to the Chinese to encourage them to attend. But, I didn't know any of
                    this at the time. I did know that when the PRC indicated that they would attend,
                    that then the question of the attendance of the ROC team became an issue. The
                    ROC team, which had been invited, was then dis-invited from the matches and did
                    not attend. I knew this subliminally, but I hadn't been paying any attention to
                    it. Meyer apparently was clued in to all of this and was familiar with it. How,
                    I don't know and I am going to have to ask him about that because I am now
                    getting back to doing research on this episode.</p>
                <pb facs="0151" n="Page0151"/>
                <p>So, I walked out of the Ambassador's office and back to my office and sat down
                    waiting for the phone to ring. I waited for somebody to call and say that
                    such-and-such a paper had noticed this story and wanted to know the position of
                    the United States government, etc. Nothing happened. Nobody called. I was
                    expecting the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to call up to ask what we were going
                    to say. I finally called Frank and asked if any of the press had called. I think
                    he told me no, nothing has happened. Then I began to worry a little bit. I
                    thought that when this thing bursts I want to make sure that we get the line out
                    that I have authored and has been approved by the Ambassador, because it was
                    beginning to dawn on me that it would be important in terms of the relationship
                    with the PRC. In other words, I didn't want the PRC to get a negative answer on
                    this because that would cut against the public statements that had been made by
                    the White House and the Department. I didn't want somebody who was uninformed
                    responding to this question either. So long as it was a business day and we were
                    in session we could be pretty sure the question would go to the right place and
                    the answer would come out right, but beyond that I didn't know. Only four
                    people, Ambassador Meyer, Alan Carter, Frank Donovan, and I knew and had agreed
                    how to respond.</p>
                <p>Also time was running and I began to realize I had better get a report to
                    Washington on this, but at that point it was a non-story. There was a press
                    report that was available to Washington DC through FBIS to the effect that an
                    invitation had been extended which begged the question of what the response had
                    been or would be and I had nothing to report in that regard. I couldn't even
                    report that we had been asked and had said something which would more or less
                    set the tone for this matter. So, I was in a bit of a dilemma. The day ended,
                    people went home, I was working late cleaning off my desk. About 6:30 Bob
                    Immerman walked into my office and handed me a slip of paper and said, “Call
                    this telephone number and ask for this person.” I said, “What is this all
                    about?” He said, “Just a minute ago I was walking out of the embassy, crossing
                    the lobby and the marine guard was muttering something about people wanting to
                    go to China.” Now, Immerman had known what had been going on during the
                    afternoon. That word had gotten around because I had informed the other people
                    in the political section as to what was happening. So, it was sort of the buzz
                    in that part of the embassy at the time. And, I guess Sneider was aware of it
                    also. Nobody had told me boo except Alan Carter who said he thought I was going
                    awfully far.</p>
                <p>So Immerman heard this marine guard was muttering something about people going to
                    China. (Parenthetically, I should note that at that time the marine guard was
                    not encased in a bulletproof pillbox in the middle of the chancery entrance. He
                    sat behind a desk to one side of the lobby, and his mutterings were perfectly
                    audible to anyone walking across the lobby.) Immerman went over and asked the
                    marine what this was all about. He said, “Oh, some guy called up and wants to go
                    to China and was looking for the duty officer. I gave him the number.” Immerman
                    said, “Did you get the man's name and telephone number?” The fellow said, “Yes.”
                    Immerman said, “Write it on a piece of paper.” The marine did and handed it to
                    Immerman who brought it up to me.</p>
                <pb facs="0152" n="Page0152"/>
                <p>I called that number in Nagoya and got Graham Steenhoven, who was at the time the
                    President of the U.S. Table Tennis Association. I told him who I was. He said,
                    “Thank God you called. I have been trying to reach the American embassy and I
                    can't get a hold of anybody. We got an invitation to go to China and I want to
                    know whether or not it would be against U.S. policy for us to accept.” He said
                    he was barricaded in his hotel room, and the team was outside excitedly pounding
                    on the door. I said, “Mr. Steenhoven, I am aware of the press report that you
                    had gotten the invitation, and if we are asked by the press, this is what we
                    will say.” I repeated to him what I had told Frank Donovan. I read the two
                    statements to him. He said, “You are saying that we should go.” I said, “No, I
                    am not saying that you should go. You are private American citizens and it is up
                    to you to make up your minds for yourselves as to what you are going to do. You
                    make the decision. I am not making it for you. The U.S. government is not going
                    to tell you what to do about this. What I am saying is that the U.S. government
                    has said that we are open to athletic exchanges with the Peoples Republic of
                    China.” He said, “Okay. It won't be against U.S. policy if we go.” I said, “No,
                    it will not.” He said, “Thank you very much and hung up.”</p>
                <p>Then I called Armin Meyer at his residence and said, “Mr. Ambassador, I have just
                    now talked with Mr. Steenhoven, President of the U.S. Table Tennis Association,
                    in Nagoya.” I started to tell him more when the Ambassador interrupted and said,
                    “Bill, can you speed this up, I'm late for a reception.” I said, “Okay, Mr.
                    Ambassador, this is the bottom line. I read him the statements and he said, 'If
                    they go it is not against U.S. policy?' and I said, 'That's right.'" Meyer said,
                    “Fine. Call Al Jenkins in Washington.” Alfred LeSesne Jenkins was the Director
                    of Mainland China Affairs at the time. It later turned out that Al Jenkins as a
                    foreign service inspector had inspected Armin Meyer in Teheran and the two of
                    them had hit it off very well and Meyer knew that Jenkins was the China desk
                    officer. I said, “Mr. Ambassador it is early in Washington, they are not at work
                    yet.” He said, “Call him anyway.” I said, “Okay.”</p>
                <pb facs="0153" n="Page0153"/>
                <p>So, I called Jenkins. I called the Department of State's operation center and as
                    I was doing so I thought that this is going out over the international telephone
                    net and everybody will pick it up. The Japanese will pick it up. Do we want
                    that? Well, we want them to know in some way or other and this is kind of a face
                    saving way for them to find out and maybe they will call me so that I can tell
                    them what is going on. I wasn't going to take the initiative to call anybody in
                    the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and tell them what we were doing. That would
                    look like we were pushing it and I didn't think we should give that kind of a
                    signal. I will come back to this in a minute.Then I thought the Russians are
                    going to find out about it for sure, but that is okay. We don't mind if they
                    know that we are getting closer to the PRC. In fact it has been part of our
                    policy over the last few years to exploit differences between the Soviets and
                    the PRC. And then I thought, well will the PRC know about it, hear about it?
                    Well, maybe and maybe not, depending on their technology. But, if they do so
                    much the better because they will know that we are positive to this idea. Then I
                    wondered if the ROC would find out about it. I thought maybe they will because
                    they have good enough technology by now that they can and if they do, so much
                    the better also because it saves us the pain of breaking the news to them out of
                    the blue. So, I saw no reason not to make this phone call, which I did.</p>
                <p>The operations center answered and I told them that I wanted to speak to Alfred
                    Jenkins who is head of the China desk. The fellow said to me, “Sir, you know it
                    is 5 o'clock in the morning in Washington and he is at home.” I said, “Yes, I do
                    know that.” He said, “You want us to wake him up?” I said, “Yes, I do want you
                    to wake him up.” He said, “Okay,” and patched me over to Al Jenkins home phone
                    out on MacArthur Blvd somewhere in DC. The phone rang and rang and rang for a
                    long time. This was in the era before answering machines. I'm not sure what
                    would have happened had one of those devices been attached to Al's phone.</p>
                <p>Finally a very sleepy but recognizable voice answered the phone. I said, “Al,
                    this is Bill Cunningham in Tokyo.” He said, “Yes. It is early morning here.” I
                    said, “I know. The PRC has invited the American table tennis team to visit China
                    after playing in the championships in Nagoya.” He said, “Yes.” I said,
                    “Ambassador Meyer wanted me to call you and tell you about this.” He said,
                    “Yes.” I said, “I have talked to the head of the table tennis association and
                    told him that if they decided to accept the invitation it will not be in
                    violation of U.S. policy.” Al said, “That sounds about right,” and hung up.</p>
                <pb facs="0154" n="Page0154"/>
                <p>I thought to myself, “My God, he doesn't know what I said. He hasn't gotten it
                    because he very clearly hung up without reacting to the most important event in
                    U.S. China relations since the Warsaw talks began.” So, I thought now what do I
                    do? Do I call him back? I was very worried because Jenkins would go into the
                    office, and any telegram that I send or press report that gets there is going to
                    be waiting for him when he arrives. His telephone is going to be ringing off the
                    hook and all kinds of people are going to be asking him what the hell is going
                    on. The White House is going to be after him. At this time I was still thinking
                    of Richard Nixon and the White House in the anti-Communist hard-line mode. I
                    didn't know about the Kissinger back channel thing and I hadn't really focused
                    on the “Foreign Affairs” article Nixon wrote in 1967 either. I assumed that this
                    news was headed toward an environment where it would be welcomed only on the
                    Mainland China desk, and only there would there be people who could manage the
                    implications and repercussions in constructive fashion. This all sounds very
                    peculiar thirty years later, but the political atmosphere in the Washington of
                    the Vietnam era was highly charged and volatile with respect to dealings with
                    any of the communist countries.</p>
                <p>I was really concerned now, but I figured I had to prepare a telegram to send out
                    to report. Then it suddenly dawned on me that Herb Levin, who had worked with me
                    and was my China colleague, now was on the national security council staff in
                    Washington. So I called Washington again and asked to be patched over to Herb
                    Levin's home. I got Herb who was fully awake, in fact finishing his breakfast
                    and soon to go out the door to get in the White House car to go to work. I told
                    him what was going on and he said, “Hah!” Great! Send your telegram, mark it
                    this way, say this, say that, and I will take care of everything at this end of
                    the line.” So, I said, “Okay, that's great.”</p>
                <p>I called my wife to say I was going to be late that evening and prepared my
                    telegram. By this time everybody had left. I was alone in the offices, the
                    secretaries had gone, etc. It was before optical character scanners for
                    transmitting telegrams had come in so I prepared to type up the telegram on a
                    green telegram form neatly enough so that the guys in the code room could
                    encrypt it. I set to work preparing what turned out to be the first of several
                    telegrams that evening. I was working on the first one and all of a sudden here
                    appeared my wife in the office with my supper. When she came in I told her what
                    was going on and she was excited and thrilled to hear about it but I told her we
                    couldn't talk about this to anyone. We have to keep it to ourselves. She, of
                    course, is very trustworthy and discreet.</p>
                <pb facs="0155" n="Page0155"/>
                <p>So, I prepared my telegram and it seems to me there were two or three that I sent
                    that evening and I can't recall why I was sending that many and included the
                    whole circuiHong Kong, Taipei, Moscow, London, where we had a China watch, Paris
                    and a few other placeand sent this thing off slugged for Washington in the way
                    Herb had told me to send it. I think I may have sent more than one. I think I
                    sent one just to say that there was a press report and that we were going to
                    respond in a certain way based upon the statements in the president's report and
                    the secretary of state's report because that was more or less kind of an open
                    unclassified sort of thing. The press report and the statements were
                    unclassified and our response would become unclassified anyway so there is no
                    reason to make that highly classified. I also wanted to be sure that the line we
                    had decided upon in Tokyo (and by then with Herb Levin in the White House also)
                    would get the widest possible distribution and thus become the governing
                    statement for all U.S. sources. Then I did a more in-depth, classified report on
                    my conversation with Steenhoven in Nagoya.</p>
                <p>I had given Steenhoven my telephone numbers and told him to call me any time if
                    he needed any help. It may have been that evening that he called back and said,
                    “Well, now, if we go to China, accept their invitation, they are going to expect
                    a reciprocal invitation from the United States. Can we invite them to come to
                    the United States and tell them they will be able to come?” I said, “Well,
                    that's a problem. I will have to put that one up to Washington.” Steenhoven was
                    a very experienced man and had been in international table tennis activities for
                    a long time and he was aware of the section of the McCarran Act, at that time
                    the governing version of the U.S. Immigration and Nationality Act. It required a
                    prior clearance by the Department of Justice of anyone coming from a Communist
                    country to the United States to verify that it would be in the national interest
                    to admit this person and would not represent a threat to the security of the
                    United States, or something to that effect. So, I knew you couldn't invite
                    anybody from one of these countries to come to the U.S. unless prior approval
                    had been obtained from the Department of Justice. Well, how do you get prior
                    approval from the Department of Justice if we hadn't told the Chinese yet that
                    we were going to accept their invitation and in return invite them to the U.S.
                    So, I said, “I cannot tell you that they indeed will be admitted to the U.S. if
                    you extend an invitation. I understand the issue here, but I do not have the
                    authority to answer your question. I will put it to Washington.” So, another
                    telegram to Washington.</p>
                <pb facs="0156" n="Page0156"/>
                <p>Finally, about midnight I managed to get home and went to sleep. At three o'clock
                    in the morning my telephone rang and it was Al Jenkins now fully alert saying,
                    “We got your telegrams in here and we understand the problem concerning
                    reciprocation and are working on them. We will be getting something out to you
                    but we wanted to let you know that this will be managed.” I guess he asked me a
                    few questions and I said, “Okay. Thanks for telling me.” I didn't know that I
                    really needed to know this at 3 o'clock in the morning, but I didn't complain;
                    Al Jenkins, now deceased, was a decent fellow. In the morning then, about six or
                    seven o'clock, either I got a phone call from Steenhoven or I called him. I
                    think I called him at his hotel in Nagoya and told him that I had heard from
                    Washington. That they were aware of the invitation and concurred in what I had
                    told him and that they were also aware of the problem of the reciprocal
                    invitation and this matter would be worked upon during the day and I expected to
                    have fresh news later on. I asked him where could I get a hold of him. He said,
                    “Okay. Thank you very much.” He was excited about all of this.</p>
                <p>I got myself to the office and I think sometime that day a suitably worded
                    instruction came in from Washington with regard to the matter of clearance in
                    advance of the invitation of unknown people who might be coming to the United
                    States to play table tennis with Americans. I passed that information on to
                    Steenhoven. In other words, giving him the green light to go ahead and extend
                    the invitation, he wouldn't be embarrassed, somehow we will work this thing
                    out.</p>
                <p>Then I started getting telephone calls. I was asked by the Foreign Ministry,
                    Hiroshi Hashimoto, who was the head of the China desk at that time, if this was
                    a change in our foreign policy towards China. I said, “No, it is not a change in
                    U.S. policy. Our policy has been publicly stated for some months.” In other
                    words, you guys should have been doing your homework; here it is in an open
                    text. So, when the invitation came from the PRC side it was obvious that the
                    American table tennis team was completely free to accept the invitation and as a
                    matter of fact I spoke with them and told them it was their decision as private
                    American citizens whether they should go or not. We are not telling them what to
                    do. Well, I was questioned up and down by the Foreign Ministry several times
                    that day about this statement.</p>
                <pb facs="0157" n="Page0157"/>
                <p>Then, of course, the press began to call and in particular Bernard Krisher, who
                    at that time was the “Newsweek” bureau chief in Tokyo. We got into a whole
                    lengthy discussion of U.S.-China relations over the last 20-25 years. Bernie,
                    who is a very good personal friend, was trying to get me on the record. He
                    wanted to quote me by name. I said, “No, you can't quote me by name.” “Well,
                    then on background a U.S. government official?” I said, “No, I won't agree to
                    that either.” “Well, senior foreign affairs observer?” I said, “That's okay.” My
                    reasoning was this. I did not want in any way to identify at that point official
                    representatives of the U.S. government with the response the table tennis team
                    was giving to the Chinese. My fear was that the Chinese might think that it was
                    some sort of a put up job in some way to lure them into a relationship that they
                    did not want. At that point I did not know what the PRC wanted. I didn't know
                    the background of this invitation. I had no way of evaluating it. I didn't know
                    its significance and I didn't want to scare them off and spoil the opportunity.
                    I felt we had made this statement and said we were open to it for the purpose of
                    precisely broadening contact with them and opening something up. I thought that
                    if the PRC got the impression that we had put the U.S. table tennis team up to
                    it in some way or even encouraged them in any way, the Chinese would back
                    off.</p>
                <p>One has to understand the context of the time. After all, the Vietnam War was at
                    its height and there was an extremely bitter relationship between the U.S. and
                    China over the Vietnam War. The Warsaw Talks had been suspended for over a year.
                    There was almost total non-communication between the two sides and there was an
                    antagonistic atmosphere. The UN representation question was on the downhill. So,
                    we were operating in very uncertain waters at that point and I didn't want to do
                    anything to disturb matters. I was very careful to avoid any sort of official
                    identification with what the table tennis team was doing. I wanted to make it
                    appear entirely and completely a private initiative. Bernie Krisher has been to
                    this day that I would not allow him to quote me by name because it tended to
                    spoil his story. He reminds me of this every time I see him. But, that is okay,
                    he is a good friend. And, of course, the foreign diplomatic corps began coming
                    around and asking me what was going on.</p>
                <p>Then I realized that none of these people on the table tennis team has ever been
                    to China and they don't know what to expect. I thought to myself, I have to talk
                    to them and give them some kind of a briefing. They may just think they are
                    going to play table tennis over there. They don't understand the significance of
                    this trip. They don't understand that they are going to be the first group of
                    Americans to get into the PRC for a very long time. Somewhere along the line I
                    contacted Steenhoven or he contacted me, and I said, “By the way, we will have
                    to validate your passports for travel to the Peoples Republic of China because
                    you have a prohibition in your passports for travel there.” He said, “Yes, we
                    are aware of that.” I said, “I would appreciate it if the passports could be
                    brought around to the American embassy in Tokyo before you leave.” They were
                    going to have to come back to Tokyo in order to leave for China via Hong Kong.
                    We made a date and he said that they would come in around 10:00 on Friday
                    morning to bring the passports to be validated. That was a way of getting them
                    into the embassy, again ostensibly of their own volition, and for me to have the
                    chance to talk to them about the trip to China.</p>
                <pb facs="0158" n="Page0158"/>
                <p>Somebody in the embassy said to me, “Aren't you going to go down to the gate and
                    meet them?” I said, “No. Why go to the gate and meet them? That makes it appear
                    as if the U.S. government was pushing this thing publicly and that is not what
                    we want to do because I don't know how the Chinese are going to react to it.” As
                    you may know the consular section of the embassy was down the street, two blocks
                    away from the chancery up on the hill. Ordinarily, somebody who wants to get his
                    passport validated would not have come to the chancery at the top of the hill;
                    they would have gone to the consular office two blocks down the street. But, I
                    had carefully instructed Steenhoven to come up to the chancery. Someone said to
                    me, “Why are they coming here on consular business? Why not send them to the
                    consular section?” I said that I wanted an excuse for them to come to the
                    compound so that I can see them privately and without having to go down there.
                    We can get a consular officer to come up here to do whatever has to be done. I
                    was under the assumption that something formal would be done to validate these
                    passports for travel to the Peoples Republic of China. There might be a seal
                    attached and a signature of some kind, statement or what not. Well, somebody did
                    come up from the consular section with a felt pen and just crossed out words
                    “those parts of China under the control of the Communist Party” and did not
                    initial it or put a seal on the passport. Anyone could have done the same thing
                    without coming into the American embassy. That was a bit of a let down but
                    somewhat beside the point.</p>
                <p>Steenhoven was shown up to my office together with a man by the name of Rufford
                    Harrison, who was the U.S. delegate to the International Table Tennis
                    Federation. They came into my office and sat down. I had one hour only to talk
                    with them about this event and explain the significance of it to them. The first
                    half hour was entirely consumed in responding to their questions about logistics
                    of the trip -how they would be treated, how to conduct themselves, etc. -
                    completely off the political subject all together. I was impatient to tell them,
                    “Look, you guys are embarking upon a mission that is of very high importance to
                    the United States and to our relationship with China.” So, we discussed for a
                    half-hour these mundane things about the food, water, hotels, shots, diseases,
                    etc. I answered them as best I could. They were particularly concerned because
                    it was after all toward the end of the Cultural Revolution and there were a lot
                    of very visible manifestations of anti-Americanism in China and they were afraid
                    of being attacked in some way by the Chinese. They didn't know how they would be
                    treated. I said, “Look, you would not have been invited if they wanted to abuse
                    you. You are going to be very well taken care of. The PRC has an excellent
                    record of being extremely hospitable to anyone whom it invites and this is in
                    effect an official invitation because sports in the PRC are under the control of
                    the ministry of sports of the government. I think you will have a very enjoyable
                    time.” They were much relieved by this.</p>
                <pb facs="0159" n="Page0159"/>
                <p>The American press corps, there were only a few in Tokyo at the time — John Rich
                    of NBC, who was an old timer, a veteran reporter in Asia and knew the area very
                    well, and, I think Bernie Krisher and one other correspondent — wanted to talk
                    to these two before they left. I saw no problem with this if they were amenable
                    to being interviewed by the press and Frank Donovan actually brought John Rich
                    up to the second floor of the embassy. He was in the corridor just outside my
                    office. So, when I finished talking to Steenhoven and Harrison there was sort of
                    a handoff to John Rich. They went out the door and he took them to be
                    interviewed some place else after which they left immediately for the airport to
                    meet up with the rest of the delegation and to have a lunch with their Chinese
                    hosts before boarding a plane to fly to Hong Kong and enter China.</p>
                <p>In the conversation with me, Steenhoven said, “You know, they are going to give
                    us gifts when we get over to China and we have to have something to give them in
                    return. We haven't got anything. We have handed out all the souvenirs that we
                    brought with us at the tournament down in Nagoya. Can you help us in any way? We
                    don't even know what they might like.” I thought a minute. At that time
                    ballpoint pens were a big deal in China and if you could have an American-made
                    ballpoint pen that was really great. Steenhoven and Harrison were thinking of
                    going out and buying something in Japanese shops somewhere. I said, “No, no, no.
                    You want to have something that is American to give to them. Something that has
                    an American brand name on it. That would be very significant because they
                    haven't got anything like that in there.” “Where are we going to find that sort
                    of thing?” I said, “Wait a minute.” I called up the administrative officer of
                    the embassy and said, “Danny, we have to get all of the American trademark
                    ballpoint pens we can find anywhere in the Tokyo region to send with a group of
                    people who are going China.” I gave him a brief explanation and asked if he
                    could take care of that. He said, “I will handle it.” I said, “Okay. I will send
                    somebody to pick these things up and deliver them to the delegation.” So, I told
                    Steenhoven that we would have ballpoint pens for him and I think there was
                    something else I thought of too, but I can't remember what it was now.</p>
                <p>Danny wanted to deliver these ballpoint pens to me to take to the delegation out
                    at the airport. I said that I couldn't do that because we didn't want an
                    American official doing this and I would have to find someone else to do it. So
                    I called our number one Japanese assistant in the political section to my office
                    and said, “I have something that I want you to deliver to the American table
                    tennis team that is going to China. Go down to the administrative office and
                    pick up a package that will be there for you and take it to J. Graham Steenhoven
                    who is president of the U.S. Table Tennis Association. You will find him either
                    at the Tokyo Prince Hotel or out at Haneda airport in the passenger lounge or
                    some place like that.” He said, “Okay.” He didn't ask me too many questions
                    about what was going on although he had a rather knowing look. Off he went.</p>
                <pb facs="0160" n="Page0160"/>
                <p>The follow up to that story is that it was just before Easter and I heard from
                    some source later on that there were complaints all over the Tokyo region that
                    no ballpoint pens were available in any of the post exchanges or navy
                    commissaries.Then the storm really broke and everybody was after me to find out
                    what was going on. The press, the Japanese Foreign Ministry were calling me. We
                    were monitoring the Japanese press reports of what was going on with the table
                    tennis team in China as well as the Chinese press reports. We were reporting all
                    of this stuff. The American reporters all asked to go with the American table
                    tennis team but they were not able to get permission from the Chinese and were
                    terribly disappointed. The American press corps in Hong Kong had a similar
                    turndown. Meanwhile the whole Japanese press corps managed to get into China and
                    follow these people. Krisher was very smart. He had somebody on his staff who
                    was Japanese but fluent in Chinese and managed to get him to go along.
                    Therefore, Krisher was getting first hand reports back from China, which he then
                    used to scoop every other American publication.</p>
                <p>The team was in China a week and then came out traveling from Hong Kong back
                    through Tokyo on its way back to the U.S. Before the team had left for China,
                    Kissinger sent out a top secret instruction to the consulate general Hong Kong
                    that told them to stay away from these people going into China and departing
                    China. The consulate general and my good friends there were all geared up to
                    interview these people going in and coming out and here they get an instruction
                    from the White House saying to stay away and have nothing to do with these
                    people. If I'm not mistaken I think the instructions said that all contact
                    should be confined to the channel that has already been established with the
                    table tennis team, which meant me. I made an arrangement with Steenhoven that he
                    would call me when he came back through Tokyo on his way back to the U.S. so
                    that I would get a readout of what happened in China. Of course, the Chinese
                    publicized everything that went on very heavily. They treated this group royally
                    with hearts and flowers all over the place and cheers everywhere they went in
                    China. The Chinese table tennis team arranged for them to win many of the
                    matches. They were fed very well.</p>
                <pb facs="0161" n="Page0161"/>
                <p>They arrived back in Tokyo on a Saturday evening. Steenhoven called me at home
                    and told me he wanted to see me - - that he had an important message. They were
                    leaving the following afternoon to return to the U.S. They were going to have to
                    leave the Imperial Hotel around 11:00 in the morning to get out to the airport.
                    I said to Steenhoven, “Let's have breakfast tomorrow morning. I will come by the
                    hotel in a taxicab. I will not come in to find you in the lobby. You wait for me
                    on the street corner. We will then come back to my house and have breakfast here
                    and you can tell me what happened. Then I will take you back to the hotel and
                    you can then go on your way.” So, that is what we did. I pulled up to the hotel
                    and Steenhoven was there and jumped into the cab and off we went to my house. I
                    didn't want to use an embassy car, again not wanting to give any hint or public
                    evidence of U.S. official interest in this event. When he got in the cab the
                    first thing he said was, “They want to come to the United States and have
                    accepted our invitation to come to the United States. Not only that, they gave
                    me a message to take to the president.” I said, “Okay.” When we got back to my
                    house, we had breakfast and Steenhoven gave me the full readout on the visit. I
                    got him back to the Imperial Hotel and then went to the embassy and wrote up the
                    report of my conversation with him.</p>
                <p>He asked me if I could arrange for them to have the courtesy of the port upon
                    arrival in Los Angeles because they were not bringing anything back of any value
                    but everybody is terribly tired and worn out by this whole experience,
                    emotionally and physically, and if we don't have to go through the long customs
                    routine to get back into the United States it would be a relief. So, I included
                    that in the telegram. Whether they received the courtesy of the port, I don't
                    know. I think they probably did.</p>
                <p>They left Tokyo and John Richardson, who was assistant secretary of state for
                    cultural and educational affairs, flew out to Los Angeles and welcomed them at
                    the airport. There was the evidence of the Department of State, the U.S.
                    government, at an official level welcoming this gesture on the part of the
                    Chinese. I think that was finally appropriate at that point. There had been many
                    other statements out of the Department of State and the White House in the
                    course of the week or two that they were in the PRC.</p>
                <pb facs="0162" n="Page0162"/>
                <p>My experience with this whole thing was not over yet because then I had an
                    endless stream of diplomats from the diplomatic corps coming around to interview
                    me about how was our policy towards China changing. What I was telling them was
                    what I had said all along. This is just an athletic exchange. There is no
                    political significance to it. The United States has said it is open to these
                    things in the President's and Secretary of State's reports. I was interviewed
                    exhaustively by the foreign diplomats and the ministry of foreign affairs. I
                    left Japan on June 21, 1971 on transfer to the U.S. I was fully truthful with
                    everyone with whom I talked about this table tennis exchange and what I said it
                    was and meant. Yes, it did indicate a warming of the relationship between the
                    U.S. and the Peoples Republic of China. The Chinese were indicating that they
                    wanted a closer relationship. It was a significant development, but it was
                    simply a people-to-people exchange not something organized by the U.S.
                    government in any way. It was spontaneous. We particularly assured my colleagues
                    in the ministry of foreign affairs that this was the case. So, I went home.</p>
                <p>In the middle of July on home leave I was sitting in my mother's kitchen in
                    California, and the evening news came on. It was announced that the President
                    would have an important statement to make. The President came on and said that
                    he wanted to let us know that Henry Kissinger was just back from a secret visit
                    to China and he has done this, that and the other. I thought, oh my God,
                    everybody I told in Tokyo that this was an ordinary people-to-people exchange
                    will not believe me at all. That was one of several of what the Japanese call
                    “Nixon shocks”.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you were lucky you weren't in Tokyo.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNNINGHAM: Yes, but I felt sorry for my colleagues who were left behind holding
                    the bag that I had set up for them. However, that's life.</p>
                <p>I am planning to write all of this up because a lot is being written on the whole
                    ping pong exchange, mostly by Chinese. I will say here on the record, again you
                    asked about Chou En-lai and how he was regarded. The standard interpretation in
                    “Henry Kissinger's White House Years,” and in John Holdridge's “Crossing the
                    Divide,” which is the account of the rapprochement between the U.S. and the
                    Peoples Republic of China, is that Chou En-lai was responsible for this
                    exchange. That he is the one who had promoted it, engineered it, and worked it
                    all out. This is not true. This is not to say that Chou didn't have a hand in
                    it, but I have from three separate, independent sources, two of them PRC
                    sources, that it was Mao Zedong who promoted this- (end of tape)</p>
                <pb facs="0163" n="Page0163"/>
                <p>-exchange. One of my sources who at the time was the Deputy Director of the U.S.
                    desk in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, told me that in a meeting he attended,
                    Chou En-lai promoted all the arguments against doing this. I think that this
                    shows something about Chou En-lai. I think he was a guy who knew how to play it
                    safe and that he was not a risk taker and that he was not a policy initiator on
                    the part of the PRC. He read the mind of Mao Zedong, to whom he was very close
                    for many years. He read it accurately all the time and he survived because he
                    was so good at reading Mao Zedong's mind and he was very careful to protect
                    himself against any repercussions that might come out of decisions that Mao made
                    or indeed against having gotten out in front of Mao's thinking and taken some
                    initiatives on his own in advance of what Mao intended to do or different from
                    what Mao intended. So, I believe as more study is done that the role of Chou
                    En-lai will be shown to be somewhat over rated in respect to U.S.-China
                    relations.</p>
                <p>There is also something else here that I have got to run down and I am going to
                    see Rufford Harrison about it in a few weeks. Harrison is of the opinion that
                    the whole thing was a put up job. He recounts an exchange with the Chinese about
                    the invitation that I never heard about at all. In other words he says that he
                    was the first one to be sounded out by the Chinese with regard to the
                    invitation, and it was not Graham Steenhoven or somebody else who received the
                    invitation from the Chinese. There is a story to the effect that one of the U.S.
                    table tennis players was the one to receive the invitation, or that it was
                    floated to one of them, something of that kind. But, according to Harrison he
                    was the one who was first approached by the Chinese.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was Harrison?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNNINGHAM: Harrison was an official of the U.S. Table Tennis Association who at
                    that time was the U.S. delegate to the International Table Tennis Federation.
                    Steenhoven was the president of the U.S. Table Tennis Association.</p>
                <pb facs="0164" n="Page0164"/>
                <p>The odd thing about this is that John Ehrlichman's book, “The China Card,”
                    according to Harrison, recites verbatim both the circumstances and the content
                    of the exchange between Harrison and the Chinese side with regard to extending
                    the invitation. Harrison says that this account is accurate. But, I never knew
                    about it and I don't know how it came to the knowledge of Ehrlichman, through
                    what channel. What I also don't know about is that Harrison said that upon
                    receiving this overture from the PRC that he called the American embassy during
                    business hours and talked to someone who said that it was no big deal to go
                    ahead. There was no registered surprise at all at the invitation. I have no
                    knowledge of who he talked to. I was not the one to whom he talked. So, I am
                    going to see him the week after next and interview him in great detail about all
                    of this and try to figure this out. I am not really ready to say that it was
                    prearranged as is alleged in Ehrlichman's book, “The China Card,” because I
                    don't quite see how that could come about and to say it was prearranged does not
                    square with some other things that I have heard about this exchange. But, I also
                    don't know how to account for what happened to the telephone call from Harrison.
                    I was the China watcher in the embassy. That was widely known by the spring of
                    1971. I had been there three years. Anything regarding China should have come to
                    me if it went to anybody in the embassy. The embassy was a very professional
                    place and we didn't have slip ups of that kind.</p>
                <p>Q: Such is oral history not only on tape but also people's memories.</p>
                <p>CUNNINGHAM: Anyway I am going to go into this and see if I can ascertain what
                    actually happened. There are some odd things. I go back to the point that the
                    ambassador made to me when I walked into his office. He didn't ask me why I was
                    there. I assumed it was Alan Carter he was talking with but I don't know that.
                    When I walked in he had some understanding of why I was there and before I said
                    anything to him he told me to go ahead. If he was taken as unawares by Alan
                    Carter's call as I was when I got the call from Frank Donovan, to me it would
                    have been somewhat out of character for Armin Meyer to respond as he did.
                    Eventually I will talk with Armin Meyer also about this because I'm curious
                    about some of these things. Maybe there is really not anything there and maybe
                    Harrison's assumptions will hold no water at all, but I want to find out a
                    little bit more about this. In any case I want to write up as accurate an
                    account of my experience as I can. So, that is more or less all there is to the
                    Tokyo story.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay. Where did you go when you came back?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0165" n="Page0165"/>
                <p>CUNNINGHAM: Let's just recount quickly what happened to me in the balance of my
                    career. From Tokyo I came back to the senior seminar on foreign policy. I had
                    received notification in the spring of 1971 that I was nominated for it and
                    asked whether I would accept the nomination. I was inclined to decline the
                    nomination because I wanted another overseas assignment. I wanted to move up to
                    a political counselor job some place. I thought I was ready for it. Bill Sherman
                    told me in no unmistakable terms that I should accept the invitation because, he
                    said, that it is an honor. So, I went into the senior seminar on foreign policy.
                    It was enlarged by five officers that year because it had always been 25 and our
                    class was 30. I was one of the first class-3 officers in the old system to be
                    appointed to senior seminar. After that I was deputy director of the senior
                    seminar for one year. Sam Berger was the director.</p>
                <p>From there I went to CU (Bureau of Cultural Affairs) and was on the East Asia
                    desk for a year. That was my out of area tour under Kissinger's global outlook
                    policy. At the end of one year there the director of that office was transferred
                    and I was expecting to move up from deputy director to director. I was moved up
                    but not to head of that office. David Hitchcock was brought in instead. He is a
                    fine man, I respect him, and well qualified for the job. I was instead put in
                    charge of the Office of Youth, Non-sponsored Student and American Specialists
                    program in CU, which I did for three years. During that time I negotiated the
                    incorporation of the East-West center in Honolulu as a public, non-profit
                    corporation.</p>
                <p>From CU, in 1977, I was sent to New York to the U.S. Mission to the United
                    Nations where I was assigned to the resource management section. That is the
                    section that deals with UN budgets and personnel issues and represents the U.S.
                    in the 5th committee of the UN general assembly. A counselor headed the section
                    and I was his assistant. David Stottlemyer was the counselor of mission for
                    resource management and I was his number two. David Stottlemyer was not well
                    received by the new administration in 1977 and the new leadership.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Carter administration.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNNINGHAM: Yes, and Andrew Young was the new UN representative. Someway or other
                    David Stottlemyer was not looked on favorably by them or they wanted to move him
                    aside in order to bring in one of their favorite people. Soon after I arrived
                    Stottlemyer was sent to Washington, so I filled two jobs, the deputy job and the
                    number one job for a year. At the end of that year I was hoping again to move up
                    to the chief position but that was not to be because the Young team had someone
                    they wanted to serve in that position and he was brought in July 1978.</p>
                <pb facs="0166" n="Page0166"/>
                <p>By then I had almost thirty years in the Foreign Service. I had over three years
                    of creditable (for retirement) service in the Navy. There was a pay cap in
                    effect and salaries were frozen. I had tried when we opened up the Liaison
                    Office in Beijing to get posted there and was told that everyone else who was a
                    China specialist hoped to get posted there and there were five or ten officers
                    applying for every job. In the senior grades they had 20 for every job. I was
                    not one of those selected to go. I can't quarrel with that because the people
                    they chose to go were very good people, some of whom I had helped train when I
                    was running the Chinese language school, so I respected the choices. The
                    Department of State had initiated the outplacement program. We had an over
                    abundance of senior officers. My family situation was changing so I decided that
                    maybe it was time to think about retirement and I went into the outplacement
                    program in 1979, after one year as acting director and one year as deputy
                    director of resource management. It became very complicated for me and I did not
                    have any really significant policy experience for the rest of my time at the
                    U.S. mission to the UN. In fact, for most of that time I was on detached duty
                    working in the outplacement program from New York where the company that was
                    running it for the Department was headquartered. Rather than be brought back to
                    Washington to go through the process I thought it would be more practical for me
                    to look from there.</p>
                <p>The short of the story is that in 1981, I received an offer or indication from
                    the University of St. Thomas in Houston that they might be interested to receive
                    an application from me for the directorship of their newly established center
                    for international studies. I did that and was brought down for an interview that
                    August, was asked for references in September, and in October I was offered a
                    contract which I signed at the end of the month. I retired in January 1982 and
                    went to Houston and immediately went to work as director of international
                    studies.</p>
                <p>Q: Looking at the time and the fact that you are up from Houston, why don't we
                    concentrate on one aspect if you don't mind. That is about resource management
                    at the UN. Management of the UN is a big problem. What were you doing and how
                    did you view it?</p>
                <p>CUNNINGHAM: Good. The 5th committee is the best seminar on the United Nations
                    going because every unit of the UN has to come down and present a budget request
                    and justify that request. I was in position to learn what every single part of
                    the UN secretariat does and to get to know the heads of each of those
                    organizations.</p>
                <pb facs="0167" n="Page0167"/>
                <p>The problem with the UN secretariat is that the United States in the early years
                    of the United Nations wanting to cultivate the goodwill of member states,
                    particularly those which were and are from developing countries, presented a
                    proposal to the United Nations every time a general assembly took place usually
                    through one of the other committees (social and economic committee, human rights
                    committee, etc.) for a new United Nations program. The thesis that we had at
                    that time was if we could get the United Nations to take on a program for a
                    country or groups of countries that would be in our view good for them, desired
                    by them and in the best interests of the United States for them to have, that we
                    would only have to pay 25 percent of the cost of the program. It was a way of
                    extending foreign assistance without having to pay 100 percent of the cost. It
                    was also a way of generating support for the United Nations in the international
                    community, engaging them with the United Nations. That was all fine so long as
                    we were able to exercise the preponderant political influence in the United
                    Nations, over these countries and enlist their support for our foreign policy
                    positions as the UN became involved in them or as they came before the UN.</p>
                <p>So, we built up bureaucracies within the UN secretariat as a result of the
                    initiatives that we took with regard to the United Nations. What we also built
                    up were vested interests because once these bureaucracies got established they
                    had two constituencies. The first constituency was the countries that would be
                    beneficiaries of the programs that these bureaucracies operated and instituted
                    with our encouragement. The second constituency would be the people who were
                    selected in one way or another to operate these bureaucracies, many of them
                    coming from other countries and supported by their country's permanent
                    representatives and delegations to the United Nations. This bureaucracy grew in
                    this way, under our patronage and with our encouragement to facilitate and
                    advance the interests of the United States in the United Nations and through the
                    United Nations.</p>
                <p>By the 1970s, two things happened. We created an expectation on the part of
                    developing member states that this process would go on a regular basis. Second,
                    when Kurt Waldheim became secretary general of the United Nations he very
                    quickly realized that he had a wonderful patronage instrument at his disposal
                    and he encouraged the generation of new programs by the United Nations
                    bureaucracy itself and the preservation of the ones that had already been
                    established. The process in the 1970s began to go out of control and began to
                    get expensive. As a result of the Vietnam War, we were running larger and larger
                    budget deficits and having inflation in this country and Jimmy Carter came in
                    and said, “Now we are going to do zero budget balancing.” This was the situation
                    in which I came into the business of resource management in the United Nations.
                    Our instructions were to do everything we possibly could to hold down spending
                    by the UN general assembly and to encourage the discontinuation of programs that
                    were obsolete, ineffective, or had been completed.</p>
                <pb facs="0168" n="Page0168"/>
                <p>I think by this time the UN had become from a management standpoint, an
                    uncontrollable bureaucracy. Any time you tried to shut something down each of
                    the constituencies that I mentioned would immediately go to Kurt Waldheim and
                    say that this could not happen and he would protect the continuation of these
                    programs because it was supporting his position as secretary general in the
                    United Nations to encourage them to remain in existence and continue to
                    function. Also, I think we were not candid about our own role. We blamed other
                    people as spendthrifts and wastrels for wanting to continue these wasteful
                    programs and to enlarge them rather acknowledging at least to ourselves that we
                    had been responsible for creating them in the first place. I think we would have
                    gotten further when it came to eliminating or reducing some of them had we
                    acknowledged that, although we still would have faced resistance.I found that
                    our style in dealing with other countries in the 5th committee of the general
                    assembly was shortsighted and rather self centered. I tried while I was there to
                    show some receptivity at least to the concerns of other delegations and some
                    consideration for their self-esteem and I think I was successful to some extent,
                    but not very successful so far as controlling the United Nations bureaucracy or
                    budget. We left ourselves open. We presented a lot of pressure points to the UN
                    bureaucracy that wanted to continue these programs in existence and to other
                    delegations that had a vested interest in them. We were not very good at
                    coordinating the defense or our position to resist those pressure points or
                    counteract them in the UN.</p>
                <p>So we started voting against the UN regular budget. First, we abstained in
                    committee and then, later, in plenary, then voting against first in committee
                    and later in plenary as well. I was responsible for drafting the explanation of
                    vote in each of these instances. There was a difference between what we did in
                    the years when the regular budget was up and in the years when the supplemental
                    budget was up. That was all very carefully orchestrated. We more readily voted
                    against the supplemental budget than against the regular budget at first. If we
                    voted no in committee, we would abstain in plenary. But the graduated approach
                    did little to slow growth in the budget or gain us supporters from other
                    delegations.</p>
                <pb facs="0169" n="Page0169"/>
                <p>We also began refusing to pay that percentage of our assessment which was
                    equivalent to the cost of programs with which we disagreed as a percentage of
                    the United Nations budget. The Russians were doing somewhat the same kind of
                    thing. I think we weakened our moral position by doing that and weakened our
                    moral position to discourage such behavior on the part of others. We used this
                    tactic as a tactic to threaten and to try to get our way, not very successfully
                    because we were overruled every time by the majorities against us. By adopting
                    that technique we set a precedent for the congress to do the same thing and as a
                    consequence the purview over the United Nations has passed out of the hands of
                    the executive branch of the government into the hands of the legislative branch
                    of the government. It is going to be very hard to recapture that now. We have
                    set up the situation for mutual antagonisms between the United Nations and the
                    United States, very much to our disadvantage, I believe. I don't know what the
                    right way is to go about this, but I just don't think that we thought it
                    through. We thought only in tactical terms on each issue, each vote, each
                    general assembly session at the United Nations. We did not think in terms of
                    long run objectives or goals. Part of the problem, of course, is the
                    politicization of the United States delegation to the United Nations and the
                    U.S. mission to the United Nations and also of the bureau of international
                    organizations affairs in the Department of State. A larger and larger percentage
                    of the staff members of the U.S. mission to the United Nations are political
                    appointees and not professional officers.</p>
                <p>Late in 1981 - - or perhaps it was during the first two weeks of January 1982,
                    the end of my career, it fell to me to draft the explanation of the vote after
                    the U.S. for the first time voted against the regular budget of the United
                    Nations. I believe this negative vote was cast both in Fifth Committee and in
                    the General Assembly. We had for most of the time that I was at the U.S. Mission
                    been moving slowly toward this point. It was historically an important moment,
                    though not an inspiring one. It marked, in my mind, one more step in retreat
                    from the high ideals we had for the United Nations when it was founded. It
                    seemed that no one else in the Mission had the background of personal
                    involvement with the progression of our position to that negative vote to draft
                    the statement. So I wrote it in a few hours one morning, and I may even have
                    been present in the Fifth Committee room when it was given. It was a downbeat
                    note, and not the sort by which one wishes to remember the last act of one's
                    career. I don't think it benefitted our position in the United Nations,
                    especially against the background of antagonism and tension that the Kirkpatrick
                    coterie had by then generated in New York.</p>
                <p>Q: Now, going back to the time you were there, it was, you might say, more
                    professional but they were still making these short term tactical plans?</p>
                <pb facs="0170" n="Page0170"/>
                <p>CUNNINGHAM: I was at the U.S. mission to the United Nations as early as in the
                    mid sixties. It was a very professional organization at that time. Adlai
                    Stevenson was the permanent representative; there were professional officers
                    there as DCM and the heads of most of the sections. Or, they were filled by
                    people who had a long track record of a professional nature in foreign affairs.
                    In 1977 when Andrew Young came in the situation was quite changed. He had a
                    professional officer, James F. Leonard, as his deputy and Don McHenry was there
                    as the alternative permanent representative for the UN security council, and
                    Melissa Wells for economic and social affairs. But, beneath them and on Andrew
                    Young's personal staff there were a great many political appointees, schedule C
                    appointees, well down into the operating levels of the UN mission to the United
                    Nations.</p>
                <p>The situation improved a little bit when Young left and Don McHenry became the
                    permanent representative. In fact, within six months, Don McHenry, who is a very
                    professional man, a superb manager, and a man for whom I have a very high
                    regard, had that mission running very smoothly indeed in a very professional
                    manner.</p>
                <p>But, when the 1980 election went to the Republicans McHenry, of course, had to
                    leave, and Jean Kirkpatrick was brought in as the permanent representative.
                    Kirkpatrick's first meeting with the Mission staff early in 1981 set the
                    negative tone for her tenure in New York. William van den Heuvel, then the DCM,
                    called a meeting of the entire mission staff to introduce her. He gave her a
                    very gracious and complementary introduction, and everyone was in a positive
                    mood, looking forward to Ambassador Kirkpatrick's first remarks. Her turn came,
                    and she said that this was not her first encounter with the Department or the
                    Foreign Service. She said that upon graduation from university many years before
                    she had taken a job in INR. Then she leaned forward, and with a bit of a glare
                    in her eye, said “And I DIDN'T like it!” Instantly, a chill fell over the room,
                    and just about everyone present felt rejected by the new Permanent
                    Representative.</p>
                <p>Under Kirkpatrick's administration, I was only there for about six months, the
                    mission became even more politicized then it had been under Andrew Young. She
                    appointed her protegees down to such levels as subsection director. So there
                    were political appointees who were working below the level of counselor of
                    mission in the United Nations where political appointees had never worked
                    before. And, they had a direct channel of communications straight to Ambassador
                    Kirkpatrick's office bypassing their own chiefs. It was the sort of system the
                    Soviets had used, interspersing political commissars among professional managers
                    and officers in the bureaucracy and the military services. The jobs of those
                    people was not to help the professional staff carry out its mission; it was to
                    report any words or actions that did not conform to the ideology of the
                    Reaganauts, as the adherents of the new Administration called themselves.</p>

                <p>This was representative, I think, of two things about Jean Kirkpatrick. First of
                    all, she had never in her professional life ever had the responsibility of
                    administering anybody more than a secretary or graduate school assistant. She
                    was not an organization person at all. Secondly, unlike Andrew Young, who was an
                    open and gregarious individual, she was rather closed, not especially
                    approachable, suspicious of everyone around her and I think consumed with the
                    idea that somebody was going to try to do her in or do something that was
                    disloyal to her or undermine her position. Indeed, as I viewed her operation
                    there it seemed to me that she was somewhat a pathetic figure on the one hand
                    unequipped by experience to handle anything as complicated as the U.S. mission
                    to the UN and on the other hand temperamentally predisposed to suspect anyone
                    except a small, close circle of protegees whom she had shaped over the years and
                    had dominated and whose loyalty to her was unquestioning, but who had no loyalty
                    to the professional operations of our mission to the United Nations.</p>
                <p>At the end of my active duty Foreign Service career I had one last encounter with
                    China. After the PRC took China's seat in the United Nations Security Council
                    several peace-keeping resolutions were presented for Council action. Usually the
                    Security Council approved these resolutions by consensus. The U.S. and the
                    Soviets had given up making peace-keeping an issue between them in the Security
                    Council. Toward the end of the 1970's the Security Council adopted the practice
                    of having informal, closed door consultations on major issues, such as, for
                    example, the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 1977-78.</p>
                <p>Each time a peace-keeping resolution came before the Council, the PRC Permanent
                    Representative would abstain. Early in the 1970s, the Chinese also would explain
                    their abstentions. As time went on, they continued to abstain, but stopped
                    making statements in explanation. In the Fifth Committee, where I had been
                    assigned, the PRC delegate would speak against the requests of the Secretariat
                    for funds to finance peacekeeping missions, and he would consistently vote
                    against them also. Then, late in 1981 the PRC, without explanation or comment of
                    any kind, stopped opposing requests in Fifth Committee for peacekeeping funds,
                    stopped voting against them and stopped abstaining in the Security Council.</p>
                <p>The matter had gone almost completely unnoticed in New York, except among a few
                    careful observers, and I suppose it was thanks to one of them that this change
                    came to my attention.</p>
                <p>It was not my responsibility to report on Security Council matters, but I was
                    very curious about it and intrigued, so I did a little study of it. Then, and I
                    do not recall how, I learned that the change was a calculated decision and that
                    Pakistan had somehow been involved in it.</p>
                <pb facs="0172" n="Page0172"/>
                <p>During the time that I served in the Fifth Committee India and Pakistan were
                    represented by profession diplomatic officers, both owhom had been trained in
                    Chinese, as I had. This became a bond among the three of us, and got to know one
                    another very well. Both of my colleagues were very capable officers. So when I
                    learned that Pakistan had something to do with this change of Chinese behavior
                    on peacekeeping issues, I went to my Pakistani colleague, whose name I do not
                    now recall. It turned out that he had been personally involved in bringing about
                    the change. He told me the whole story, and I prepared full report to the
                    Department on the matter. I also complimented him on his initiative and his
                    accomplishment, which was indeed a genuine and important contribution to the
                    strengthening of the United Nations. My Pakistani colleague told me that what
                    finally brought the PRC around was the argument that China's opposition was
                    depleting its political capital among developing nations, who generally favored
                    and supported the peacekeeping role of the United Nations because it reduced the
                    risk of superpower conflict.</p>
                <p>The press did not notice this change until some weeks or a few months later. Some
                    weeks or a few months later I noticed a New York Times report on the change in
                    PRC behavior. By then I was in Houston and well into my new career. It gave me
                    some satisfaction to know that in just about the final act of my Foreign Service
                    career I had scooped the New York press corps and, apparently, most other
                    missions and delegations to the United Nations.</p>
