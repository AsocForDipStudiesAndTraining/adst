                <p>[Note: This interview was not edited by Mr. Stacey.]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is March 26, 1999, and the interview is with Roy
                        Stacey. Let's start off today covering a bit about where you grew up, your
                        early years, your education and bring out anything that suggests why you got
                        into international affairs and development rather than something else.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: I had a rather idyllic childhood running around the beaches of Hawaii,
                    and growing up really as a minority, as we were called in those days. There
                    weren't too many of us who were real mainlanders in the pre-war period in
                    Hawaii. Later I finished my education in California for high school and my
                    undergraduate work. During the time that I was at the University of California,
                    I got involved in something called Project India, which was a competitive
                    student program that sent out fourteen American students in two teams of seven
                    each to India to do a summer work program with Indian students. That was my
                    Junior year in my undergraduate program, and up until that time I had been
                    heading towards an ultimate degree in law with a political science major. But
                    this trip to India in the summer of 1960 was really an eye opener, and really so
                    changed the directions that I was going in.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing in India?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: It was a program that had been devised by the University of California,
                    at UCLA. It was really kind of a precursor to the Peace Corps as a matter of
                    fact. When the Peace Corps was formed later in the early sixties, it adopted a
                    lot of the training methods of Project India. What we really did was work under
                    very difficult conditions with Indian students in urban slums and rural areas
                    building clinics. Very much of self-ed program, going around visiting Indian
                    colleges, answering questions about the United States. It was both good will and
                    there were some very concrete things we tried to do in terms of self-ed.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was that related to a particular course at the
                        university?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: No, it had nothing to do with a course. It was a program that was
                    sponsored by all of the religious groups on campus. It was an ecumenical
                    program. There were hundreds of students that applied every year, and only
                    fourteen were selected. Those fourteen were selected from a larger pool of about
                    fifty, who went up into the mountains and went through a real tough training
                    program. You had to sleep on the ground and eat dirty food. It was really the
                    kind of training that Peace Corps went through. They love it. Anyway, this
                    changed my directions toward wanting a career in development.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I see. Your major was Political Science?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: Major was Political Science with an emphasis on China. My language was
                    Mandarin. I thought I was going to be among the first wave of Foreign Services
                    Officers going to China. Little did I know that AID would only have a post to
                    offer me in Mogadishu, Somalia, and I never did serve in Asia, but nonetheless,
                    that was the major at the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But you had the idea of joining the Foreign Service?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: That's correct, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was that AID?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: No, that was Foreign Service. I got interested in AID later on through a
                    senior AID official that I met, a man by the name of Seymour Peyser, who was the
                    second man in AID's private sector office back in those days. After I came to
                    Washington, DC in 1961-62. I came for a Master's program at George Washington, I
                    met Sy Peyser who taught me all about the Junior Officer Training Program. After
                    I got my Masters, I applied for the JOT Program.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you go for your Masters?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: I went to George Washington, and got a Masters in Public
                    Administration.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did it have any international character to it or was it
                        strictly Public Administration?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>STACEY: No, it was strictly a degree in Public Administration. I later, thanks to
                    AID, had a very good year and a half program at the Fletcher School. That was
                    after my first tour overseas. AID had a contract with the Fletcher School in
                    those days on popular participation and development, the old Carter-Lang
                    program, so that enabled me to get some additional work on International
                    Economics and Development early in my career.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you got your Masters Degree and...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: I actually got two Masters. I got another one at Fletcher, thanks to AID,
                    but I didn't go on and complete the Doctorate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I see. So how did you get into AID?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: I applied to the Junior Officer Training Program. I went through written
                    and panel exams, and I was one of seventeen selected in 1963 for the JOT
                    program, which preceded the IDI Program. It was called the JOT program. As I
                    recall I was the only one among the seventeen that didn't have a Doctorate, so I
                    just got in under the wire.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What year was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: That was 1963.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And what was your first assignment?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: My first assignment was to the Somalia desk, because I had been slated to
                    go to Mogadishu for my first assignment with AID. So I had a year on the Somali
                    desk and then went over to Mogadishu from 1965-67.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have an orientation program?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: Yes, there was an orientation program. I worked in different parts of the
                    African Bureau, aside from the Somali desk. I went to DP (Development Program
                    Office) and worked for awhile; I worked in different parts of the African
                    Bureau.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was you impression of the agency at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>STACEY: This was right at the beginning, and I was young and naive. While I was
                    doing my graduate degree at George Washington, I had worked for a year in the
                    Senate, for Senator Edward Long of Missouri. It certainly was long enough to
                    convince me that I really didn't want to be part of the Legislative branch. I
                    really found a lot of things that shocked me in the Senate, in terms of the
                    inattention to detail or real issues. There was a great deal of self-interest in
                    the Senator's office that really rubbed me wrong. So it was really very good
                    when I had this opportunity to go to work with AID.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After your year on the Somali desk, what happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: After the Somali desk, I went out to Mogadishu as the Assistant Program
                    Officer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation in Somalia at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: Ed Hogan was the Program Officer and Mabel Warnicki was the Deputy
                    Program Officer and I was the Assistant Program Officer. The situation in
                    Somalia in those days was very much one of Cold War politics. The single largest
                    program was the Public Safety Program. We had eight Public Safety advisors
                    there. We had a deep relationship with the Somali police.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was the largest program?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: Yes, and the Soviet Union had a very strong relationship with the Somali
                    army, so the whole program there was very much oriented towards a sort of
                    competitive advantage over our covert adversaries. There were perceptions that
                    this Horn of Africa was a strategic interest for the U.S., given its geographic
                    proximity to the Middle East.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were we doing in the police program?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: Teaching the Somali police to act as a counterbalance to the Somali army.
                    That was the single largest program along with Kismayo Port, which was a port we
                    were building in the south of the country, ostensibly for banana exports, to
                    stimulate development of the inter-river region down there between the Juba and
                    the Shebelle Rivers. In fact in looking through the files, it was clear that the
                    port was undertaken for AID for some eventual strategic advantage that people in
                    the Foreign Service establishment saw that Somalia might play in the Cold
                    War.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you work with the Somali's?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>STACEY: Yes, we worked quite closely with the Somali's. I think that I had
                    perhaps the most interesting project of the time, which was the project that I
                    really got to manage, since I was the junior person in the mission, which was a
                    rural school construction project that we were doing jointly with the Peace
                    Corps. According to information that I had, it was one of the first joint
                    AID/Peace Corps programs, because this was very early in the Peace Corp's
                    existence.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They usually didn't want to cooperate with AID in those
                        days.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: That's right. There was a very strong injunction against it. What
                    happened is they sent a couple of Peace Corp volunteers who were out there and
                    had a little bit of background in architecture and had designed a very
                    inexpensive schoolhouse, that could be constructed largely out of local
                    materials, but it did require the importation of your roofing materials, window
                    frames, cement, some paint. But I think the input content was maybe thirty
                    percent. Local labor content was maybe fifty percent and then there was another
                    twenty percent local costs. So we had worked out a program where the Peace Corps
                    would deal with designs, and AID would import pickup trucks, cement mixers that
                    we would hook up on the back of pickup trucks, the cement and the imported
                    materials. The Peace Corp. volunteers along with local villagers were
                    supervising the self-help and the construction, so AID's role was largely the
                    importation and signing off on the completed building. We built over 570
                    schoolhouses in two years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Five hundred? What's happened to them? Were they able to
                        staff them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: Yes, they were able to staff them and were able to build furniture and
                    get the furniture out there, but to my knowledge most of them were destroyed
                    during the war. As civil disorder spread in Somalia, anything that was an
                    official building usually became a target of various groups. According to the
                    information I have, most of the schools have been destroyed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Fascinating. I hadn't heard about that project. Was there
                        any other project of note in your experience there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>STACEY: Yes. We had a major agricultural research institution in Baidoa that did
                    a lot of work on improved varieties of sorghum and millet. It was one of the
                    early breeding stations. I think it was Kansas State University that was
                    implementing that project. While I don't have the proof of it, I'm sure that
                    some of that research is today is being used in Somalia, because they're still
                    largely sorghum producers in terms of agriculture. The other major project was a
                    teacher training institute at Afgoi which was run by Eastern Michigan
                    University. We trained a large number of Somali teachers. I think this institute
                    was converted into other uses after the CFIA came to power. I think our single
                    biggest failure that I can remember, aside from Kismayo Port, which had major
                    problems. We had improper supervision on the construction of the port. This was
                    supposed to have been done by the U.S. Corp of Engineers, but the Corp of
                    Engineers wasn't really watching things that closely and neither was the AID
                    engineer and as a result there was a lot of salt that got mixed into the cement.
                    A few years down the road the port began to disintegrate, so AID later had to go
                    in there and make costly repairs to this port. So to this day Kismayo Port is
                    used very little.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It wasn't used very much in those days?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: It wasn't used very much. They had gotten one banana boat a month, maybe
                    two. It was largely for the export of bananas and grapefruit, which were being
                    produced by Italian ex-patriots on large scale plantations. It was never really
                    intended to benefit small farmers or ordinary Somalis. So that was certainly a
                    failure. I can't imagine how or why we got into that port in the first place
                    except for the reason I gave you earlier. There was also the famous
                    Somali-American Fishing Company, SAFCO, which was a fish freezing plant that was
                    built way up north on the Somali coast in a town called Alula. Pretty much at
                    the end of the world out there. But SAFCO had been built largely on the
                    recommendations of an American fisheries expert who had been in Somalia about
                    seven years when I arrived. The guy's name was Scotty Napir. Scotty had written
                    up great stories about the increased catches of fish that the Somali fishermen
                    were recording, tuna, and all sorts of large fish. Based largely on the “fish”
                    stories of this expert, the Somali's formed their own fishing company, the
                    Somali Fishing Company. Then the Somali Fishing Company approached AID for a
                    joint loan. AID found a company in Massachusetts, Quincy Market and Cold
                    Storage, which is now bankrupt- no longer in existence- and a joint project for
                    SAFCO was done. After this fish plant was completed on this coast up in Alula,
                    they started fishing and lo and behold, people discovered that there weren't a
                    lot of fish around. Not the kinds they wanted at least. Further research
                    apparently showed there had never been a large number of fish in those waters.
                    Eventually the plant went bankrupt and was sold to Kuwaiti interests. I don't
                    know if it's still in operation, but that project was a failure.</p>

                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>STACEY: No, the company did an independent feasibility study, but I have reason
                    to believe that there were other interests in this project. There were certain
                    parties in the U.S. government who wanted an observation post up on the north
                    coast of Somalia in those days when that was a critical lifeline for all of the
                    oil supplies going in.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were the Soviets there at the time and did you have

                </p>
                <p>STACEY: The Soviets were there and no, we didn't have much contact with them at
                    all. They were building a big air base up in the north of Somalia. There was a
                    real tension between the different communities in those days. The only
                    importance of Somalia was its geography. There's really nothing there in terms
                    of resources. This desolate place of less than two million people had become
                    such a competition ground for the Cold War.</p>

                </p>
                <p>STACEY: Yes, and this was really surprising to me as a young AID officer, because
                    I'd gone out there to do development and here was this major public safety
                    program. It was ironic later on when the first democratically elected Prime
                    Minister of Somalia, Muhammad Egal, was overthrown, the President of the
                    country, who was more of a figurehead, was assassinated. It was ironic that the
                    man, who pulled the trigger on this assassination had been trained by the USA
                    Public Safety Program. He learned how to shoot a gun at our pistol range here in
                    Washington, DC, and apparently he learned to shoot straight. It was ironic that
                    the end of fledgling democracy in Somalia came from one of our trained public
                    safety people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this a clan feud?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: Yes, largely a clan feud. In the days when we were there, Somali was an
                    unwritten language still. All of our official work was done in Italian. We
                    understood very, very little about these people, their clans, their social
                    interrelationships, their feuds.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Somalia was then viewed as a homogeneous country that
                        didn't have all these complex tribal issues and therefore it was very
                        promising, had a common language, etc. We missed something.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: That's right. It shows how we thought that because there was a common
                    language and a common religion, that this was a homogeneous country. But when
                    you looked below the surface, it was much more fractious than that.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find working with the Somalis?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: At the time I found them quite interesting. I was struck by, in the midst
                    of all their poverty, how proud they were. Matter of fact, they used to tell me
                    that I had all these problems and worries of having come from the developed
                    world. I had to worry about nuclear accidents; I had to worry about pollution
                    and all kinds of things and I really couldn't go out like they could for two or
                    three months at a time with their camels, sleep under the stars and drink
                    camel's milk. I just couldn't appreciate this higher form of life that they had.
                    So we had some wonderful discussions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm sure you did. Were there some who were sufficiently
                        educated in English that you could communicate with?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Stacey: Oh, yes. You had a veneer of highly educated Somalis, some of whom had
                    studied in the States. You had another group who had gotten their education in
                    Italy. You know, under the Italian system even if you got a high school degree
                    in those days you could call yourself a “doctore.” So you had a lot of
                    “doctores” in different positions. You could begin to see the differences
                    between the kind of education they had in Italy, and some of the Somalis who had
                    a U.S. education. We invested a great deal in the human resources in that
                    country in those days. The number of participants who were trained was
                    substantial. Who knows where those people are. I doubt that very few of them are
                    still in the country. I suspect most of them with any kind of an advanced
                    education had to leave the country in order to survive.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have a sense of the Cold War going on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: We had a sense of it only in the sense that it was clear that the Public
                    Safety program, our work with the police, had a very, very high priority. It was
                    also clear in some of the areas of the country where we were restricted from
                    going to because there was Soviet military presence. I went off on a safari one
                    day with one of my colleagues and we accidentally wandered into one of the areas
                    where there were some Russian tanks, Somalis were being trained on Russian
                    tanks. We barely escaped with our lives. They stopped us and stripped us and
                    made us lay down on the ground in the hot sun.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These were the Russians?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>STACEY: No, these were the Somalis. They accused us of being spies, because we
                    had binoculars, we had cameras. That's what you normally take on safari, so they
                    said we were spies. We were getting pretty badly sunburned lying out there in
                    the sun as I recall, and fortunately a Somali officer came along who had been
                    trained at Sandhurst. We convinced him that we were innocent and he told us to
                    get the heck out of there. We were most happy to do so.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the conditions in the country? You
                        traveled around in it quite a bit I guess.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: You had this contrast of what we would call extreme poverty, and yet in
                    those days Somalia was at peace. Those who were practicing pastoralism had a
                    relatively consistent source of food and they had their herds, and they had
                    their grazing patterns, which were uninterrupted. Those who were cultivating the
                    river valley there was water, and they could cultivate. Education was needed and
                    healthcare was needed, but again it looked promising. It looked like there were
                    some opportunities for some slow but not spectacular growth. What we didn't
                    understand was the depth of the political problems, which later resulted in Said
                    Bari coming to power. As you recall this was after I had left there. We
                    continued (the U.S.) to support Said Bari again for reasons of Cold War
                    strategic location. During the time that Said Bari was in power, the civil
                    society was sort of systematically destroyed. Farmers cooperatives, herders
                    groups, things like that which existed - the kinds of elements of social
                    interaction that can absorb conflict- were systematically destroyed by Said
                    Bari.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were his motives, power and control?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: Power. Of course, when Said Bari was finally overthrown, the result was
                    now a country that split into many different pieces with the so called war lords
                    and so on. It really has reverted to a government structure that is almost
                    medieval right now. It's very sad.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's interesting. How long were you there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: I was there until 1967.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there quite a while I guess.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>STACEY: Yes, 1965-1967. I remember I left on the day that the Arab-Israeli War
                    started in 1967. I did a little bit of short-term work then with the East
                    African community office which was in Nairobi. I do recall that this was about
                    the time that the Korry report was published, which had as an intention to limit
                    all bi-lateral programs to ten in all of Africa. So it appeared that Somalia
                    would not be one of those 10 countries at that point, and we wanted to put
                    greater emphasis on what we could achieve through the East African community and
                    through the East Africa regional program.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Part of the Korry report was to emphasize regional
                        programs?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: Right. To emphasize regional. I do think there that looking back I don't
                    have a lot of observations on the program with the East Africa community, but I
                    think it was a missed opportunity. Our approach to the East Africa community was
                    very technical. We were doing things with seed sterilization and all kinds of
                    things with livestock and veterinary control. It assumed that the political
                    consensus on the institutions was there. The political consensus wasn't there.
                    Our diplomats and our ambassadors had no major political interest in the East
                    African community, so it seemed like our whole approach to it was technical. We
                    didn't have a political strategy. If we had a political strategy we would have
                    recognized that one of the things that has enabled Europe to get to progress has
                    been the compensatory mechanisms which made sure that poorer countries like
                    Portugal and Greece would come along with the rest. Of course that is what was
                    missing in the East African community, with most of the growth and economic
                    activity going to Kenya. If we had more of a political approach and more of a
                    political strategy, I think that maybe we could have preserved more of that
                    regional program in that period. It looked like such a wonderful opportunity at
                    the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But your work was mostly with the technical?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: Yes, I was really doing program work. This was just a short-term
                    assignment before I came back to Washington in 1968.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What position did you come back to?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: I came back onto the Uganda desk. I was Uganda desk officer then and I
                    was working with Will Muller on the Uganda program. Again, Uganda seemed like
                    such a glorious opportunity. This was the pre-Idi Amin period of time, and it
                    was one of those countries where anything would grow. They used to say you could
                    stick a pencil in the ground in Uganda and it will sprout. So I worked as the
                    Ugandan desk officer for a year and then was offered this opportunity to go for
                    mid-tour training to the Fletcher School on Participation and Development. I
                    went up to Fletcher from 1969-1970.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's interesting that early on in your career that you

                </p>
                <p>STACEY: Yes, a total surprise. I was sitting in my office one day and I got a
                    call from Princeton Lyman, who was in PPC in those days. Princeton said “We have
                    a group going up to Fletcher and we've got one more slot. I know you haven't
                    been with the agency very long but would you be interested?” It didn't take me
                    long to decide.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the purpose of the program?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: The Congress had put into the legislation a so called Title IX, where AID
                    was supposed to take into account everything it did in popular participation and
                    development. AID felt they didn't have a great deal of knowledge about what this
                    meant. So they developed a contract with Professor Rob West at the Fletcher
                    school, who had been a former AID Director in Zaire. Rob West along with
                    Professor Von Lazar up there had developed a model which we could use to measure
                    the relationship between economic growth and political change, and vice versa.
                    The idea was to put these seven students through a training program and then see
                    if we could apply the model to a particular country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you remember the characteristics of the model?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: You know, I really don't. I'd have to go back and dig it out. I wrote my
                    paper on pre- Idi Amin Uganda and tried to indicate why there was a degree of
                    political change going on that was going to improve the prospects for political
                    growth. I hadn't calculated into my paper Idi Amin. When he arrived that
                    was...this element of dictatorship or “governance” as I like to call it.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there other aspects about this course? It predates
                        the recent developments of participation. Were there other aspects that we
                        are talking about today?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: I spend those two years sort of academically up there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was a two-year program?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>STACEY: It was a two-year program. What happened to me as a result of that
                    program was unexpected because as you'll recall, the year 69-70 was the height
                    of the anti-Vietnam War demonstrations. Being in Boston at the time we were
                    really caught up in all this, and I would say we became a little more militant
                    on the subject than we would have been normally because we were in this academic
                    environment. I was informed in the second year of my program at Fletcher that I
                    had been chosen to go to Vietnam to be the Senior Planning Officer at CORDS. I'd
                    already done my military career. I'd joined the Air Force when I was seventeen,
                    and I had completed four years of active duty and another four years of reserve,
                    and so I felt like I didn't join AID to go and participate in what really was a
                    military exercise in my mind. So I turned down the Vietnam assignment and as a
                    result I had to submit my letter of resignation to AID because you recall, in
                    those days, people who refused to go were required to put in their resignation.
                    I was pretty angry because I liked very much what AID was about, and I really
                    felt that what we were being called upon to do in Vietnam was such a distortion
                    of our mission that it was personally very troubling. But that didn't
                    happen.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They didn't make you resign?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: They didn't make me resign. I think there were a few people in the
                    agency, who perhaps thought I had something to offer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At this point you were a trained Title IX Officer, were
                        you not? Was there any idea that you would come back to be doing Title IX
                        type of programming?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: It wasn't really Title IX programming but I think that some aspects of
                    the training I had just had came in good stead, because the assignment that was
                    proposed to me was to go out into the BLS countries in Southern Africa to start
                    some of the early programs out there. We had really just opened up this office
                    of OSARAC (Office of Southern Africa Regional Affairs). So I went down there as
                    the Program Officer. This was in 1971. Some of the activities that we were
                    beginning in Botswana we did draw on some of the Title IX work.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Like what? Do you have any examples?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: We had a land settlement program in Swaziland, which involved
                    rationalizing land</p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>use. It was land use planning so that the areas that were being farmed in a very
                    irrational way where they had erosion problems, where they hadn't demarcated the
                    grazing areas from the irrigated farming from the rain-fed agriculture. So we
                    came in - this was a joint project with the British - but all of the land use
                    planning was done through what they call in Southern Africa “congretla”, where
                    you sit down with the villagers and talk about what they want and their
                    objectives. You have to talk about these things as long as it takes until
                    there's a consensus, and it's a very horizontal type discussion with no time
                    limits.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you participate in that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: Yes, we participated in that. We had also some regional activities there
                    that we were trying to hang onto like preserving the University of Botswana as a
                    Regional Center of Excellence. Despite all the talk over the years about
                    Regional Centers of Excellence, there aren't any that... So that also failed,
                    when the UBLS eventually split apart.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were based in Swaziland?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: Yes, I was based in Swaziland but we had responsibility for Lesotho,
                    Botswana and Malawi. I think that what was important at this time, historically
                    speaking, was that we had a unique regional model there of an office, where we
                    had only one AID staff in Botswana, one in Lesotho and one in Malawi. They were
                    an integral part of the embassy. They were listed as the Second Secretary for
                    Development and they reported to the Ambassador but they got all of their
                    authorities for funding, for contracts, through the regional AID office. And the
                    regional AID office wrote their evaluations, but based on a letter from the
                    Ambassador. These people had a full place at the table and the donor meetings;
                    but it was a great model of a regional program with a bilateral dimension and
                    yet without separate AID offices, the staff was part of the embassy. It's a
                    model that I think AID should have reconsidered in the last few years when they
                    began closing missions all over the place. In many cases I still feel horrified
                    at some of the mission size that I saw over the years of my career, and yet
                    there were so many examples that we had of implementing programs with small
                    missions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was supposed to be within a regional framework,
                        except for the concentration countries. Were all your projects
                        regional?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: No, in fact some of the activities that people were undertaking were
                    national projects, but we were undertaking them through a regional umbrella.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What kind of projects stood out in your mind that you
                        found significant?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>STACEY: I think that perhaps the most important contributions we made in those
                    days were in Botswana frankly. Very quietly we began to work with Botswana on
                    education, both in terms of secondary education and the University of Botswana -
                    the Botswana campus of the UBLS. They organized, with some assistance we
                    provided through the Ford Foundation in those days a civil service that really
                    was based on merit. Looking back, I think that was one of the most important
                    things Botswana did. They had outstanding civil servants all through their early
                    independence, which has really helped them in managing their economy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why do you think this came about there when it didn't
                        elsewhere?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: Through the foresight of the president of Botswana in those days- he had
                    enormous foresight and was probably one of the best leaders Africa's had in the
                    post independence period. He felt that the two most essential things for
                    Botswana was to have a competent, honest civil service, and secondly to make
                    sure they invested the returns from the mineral resources into education and
                    into human capital. One of the few countries that didn't catch the Dutch disease
                    in terms of the way they manage their mineral resources.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But they had a very limited number of Botswanans, who had
                        an education and advancement.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>How did they staff the government?</p>
                <p>STACEY: They staffed it rather slowly. You had a number of ex-patriots who were
                    down there who were either British or South African citizens. They weren't
                    thrown out of their posts immediately. It was the policy of the government to
                    “Africanize” the civil service as people became competent to do so. There were
                    people in the civil service who went on, for instance, to the World Bank, and
                    then came back to the Botswana government because the terms of service were so
                    attractive. I think that another important contribution that we made was a
                    project, which we wouldn't do today. This was a water supply project for a new
                    town that was going to grow up around a mining venture. This was a private
                    sector mining venture, nickel and copper, and it required actually the creation
                    of a small town at Selebi-Phikwe. That town couldn't be created without a water
                    supply and AID undertook the project to bring water from the Selebi River to the
                    town. I forget the distance. That was a turnkey project managed by Sam Rea who
                    was the Botswana officer, and to this day Selebi-Phikwe is a thriving little
                    town, and stayed a thriving little town because they took the returns from the
                    copper and nickel and invested it wisely, unlike what other countries have done
                    with their mineral resources. Again, this is the kind of project that could have
                    been a failure had the government made subsequent poor policy decisions. But
                    because they made wise policy decisions, the project I think was a success.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did we have an operating executives program at that time
                        providing staff for government positions?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: Yes, we were providing people on a topped up basis. You just refreshed my
                    memory. This was an issue because the government was very sensitive to the
                    “topping up”. They didn't want the kind of disequilibria in their compensation
                    packages for staff. So they were very careful about bringing in ex-pats. But on
                    the other hand, when the government did bring them in they didn't become just
                    marginalized or advisors. In other words, they had a serious job to do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there a fair number of them, do you recall?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: A modest number, but given the size of Botswana, it was a relatively
                    modest number.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the political environment in which you were
                        working there, given the South African situation then? Did you have a feel
                        for that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: The political situation was actually quite tense. I recall that we had
                    great difficulty getting visas from the South African government even to do our
                    regional work. In those days we either had to fly into Johannesburg and stay
                    overnight, which was sometimes a little bit uncomfortable, or we could drive by
                    the most direct route between Swaziland and Botswana, and we had to get there
                    within twelve hours. So we frequently had to drive that route - I think I drove
                    you once as a matter of fact - from Basitu to Botswana. I remember once you
                    being on a visit out there and we did that drive. South Africa saw the AID
                    people very much as troublemakers. They monitored our activities pretty
                    carefully.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the impact of our program on the development in
                        those three countries?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: Again, I think we did some important projects in the three countries, but
                    without my going back there I don't know to what extent they've stood the test
                    of time. We had a large focus on education which you'll find almost missing now
                    from what we're doing in Africa. We were doing an important secondary school in
                    Swaziland. We were doing a technical training institute as well. We had
                    important programs with all of the three campuses of the UBLS. We were doing a
                    little bit of infrastructure and road building. In Lesotho we had started an
                    important effort in soil erosion. Lesotho has some of the most credible soil on
                    this earth, and it used to be said that Lesotho's major export was soil to South
                    Africa.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Any other perspective on those countries? That was your
                        first introduction to Southern Africa?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: That was my first introduction to Southern Africa, which I was to come
                    back to again later in my career. I do recall feeling that ultimately these
                    small former high commission countries, the BLS countries, especially Lesotho,
                    didn't make a great deal of sense, especially in a longer term geo-political
                    view of Southern Africa. Eventually these almost artificial borders would have
                    to disappear as a result of economic forces.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Anything else on that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: No, I think that's about all.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there for two years?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: Yes, I was there for two years, from 1971-1973.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay. And then where did you go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: I was asked to go to the Ivory Coast in 1973 to be the Regional Planning
                    Officer for REDSO in Ivory Coast.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Interesting. What's the role of the Regional Planning
                        Officer?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: It's funny that you should ask, because that's the same question I asked
                    when they offered me the job. There weren't very many of those in AID in those
                    days. The idea was for me to head up a section of the office, which was to do
                    some long-term thinking on the West Africa region and what kind of regional
                    strategy and programs would make the most sense. We were still in those days
                    fighting against the restrictions of the Korry report. We had all kinds of
                    regional programs that we had cooked up. Some of them looked like real Rube
                    Goldberg operations in order to circumvent the restrictions of the Korry
                    report.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you give me any examples?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: Of some of these regional programs? Yes, I can. We had a series of
                    programs with the Entente Fund. which were very strange because the Entente was
                    hardly a regional body. It seemed to be built around a personality. I can't even
                    remember the man's name, but he was quite a dynamic salesman.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mean the Executive Director of the Fund?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: Of the Entente Fund, who had developed certain personal relationships
                    with people in the U.S. and AID. So there were a series of regional programs
                    under the Entente Fund - like the Intermediate Credit Program- that looked
                    promising but I think they were pretty much doomed to failure because the
                    Entente was a kind of personality cult built around one person. We were
                    delivering what we thought were some important projects to groups that we
                    couldn't have reached otherwise.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you do with Regional Planning? What kind of ideas
                        were you coming up with?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: The work really became dominated by the great Sahelian drought in 1973.
                    It was dominated by the enormous task of getting the food relief in. We had tons
                    of food sitting on the docks that we couldn't move inland. We had food that was
                    in danger of rotting in warehouses. We had a logistical nightmare in the
                    1973-1974 period. So in that context, the kind of regional planning that we did
                    do was to look at the adaptive strategies of people. We had a situation in which
                    the old systems that sustain people were breaking down. Old systems of
                    production, systems of how people move their cattle and so forth were breaking
                    down, and it wasn't very obvious what the new household strategies would be. We
                    focused our research and our fieldwork on trying to understand what people were
                    doing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Triggered by the drought?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>STACEY: Triggered by the drought but it was part of a larger picture of the
                    breakdown of these systems that used to sustain them. In the 1950's they had a
                    period of abundant rainfall in the Sahel. The seventies and eighties had been
                    just the opposite, so we were trying to understand how people were changing
                    their lives. It became obvious to me at that time that one of the most
                    fundamental aspects of their adaptive strategies was human mobility. These
                    borders that we saw on the map, which were drawn conveniently back in 1899 when
                    the Europeans sat down to divide up Africa, didn't mean a thing to these people.
                    As a matter of fact, in order to survive, one or more family members always had
                    to disregard borders. A lot of our work in those days- we had Mike Horowitz, a
                    well known anthropologist from SUNY in New York who was under contract with AID
                    for a couple of years - I had him working for me and an Ag economist from
                    Perdue, so we had people who were good in research. We had very little
                    understanding in '73 of the literature in French. There was enormous literature
                    on this region, but we had hardly looked at it. Frankly a lot of AID people
                    tended to disregard the French observations and the French conclusions. There
                    was sort of an attitude that “if the French knew what they were doing, these
                    countries wouldn't be in the state they were in.” Which was unfortunate. Just on
                    tropical forestry alone, there's a huge institute outside of Paris that has
                    enormous data and information on forestry in West Africa. It was also a time of
                    really familiarizing ourselves with French literature and beginning to
                    understand a lot more about the region than we knew.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any particular findings other than the one's
                        you've mentioned in this research?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: We did get into some project design work. As you recall, we had a rather
                    unusual appropriation of funds during the 1973-74 period for Sahelian projects
                    and we had to obligate those funds in a very short time period. I do recall
                    taking a team of about nine people up to eastern Burkina Faso to design an
                    integrated rural development project. It was one of those situations where
                    you've got x amount of money, you've got three months to design and approve the
                    project in or you lose the money. You know that. The people in Upper Volta,
                    which was the name of the country in those days, knew that. Everybody would give
                    you all the right answers in order to come up with a project because there was
                    money to be lost otherwise. So we went out and we visited sixty-two villages in
                    two weeks time. We borrowed sleeping bags from the Peace Corp. We bought a bunch
                    of tin food from the commissary and we went out in the bush for two weeks.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Nine of you?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>STACEY: Yes. We hired two bush taxis, these old Peugeot 404's. We'd throw out
                    mosquito nets up over the trees every night and we had cots and we'd sleep out.
                    We did all this in a bottom up way. We talked to farmers and so on. Of course we
                    found out that the farmers had a totally different view of what the priorities
                    were than the government did. We eventually reconciled those differences
                    with...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you remember what they were?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: The people were very interested in the water supply and roads as a first
                    priority, and the government was interested in importing things. In other words,
                    they wanted a project with lots of vehicles and all kinds of things like that.
                    We were somewhere in between. We were looking at a project with much more
                    intermediate technology, animal traction - no tractors- we were way apart on
                    priorities. Eventually we decided on a technical package that we thought would
                    work in the region based on the research, but it was all supply driven. What was
                    driving this project was the money was sitting there, and everybody wanted to
                    obligate it. We had a deadline to do it, and we did it and, of course, the
                    project ultimately was not evaluated as a success. Funds were disposed; experts
                    came out. Now if you go to the area today, which is where this project was
                    located, it's a thriving little town. I would say that when the EC paved the
                    road it had a major impact. We wouldn't do that. They wanted us to pave the road
                    and we said we wanted to work with the small farmers. It was my first experience
                    with a so-called Integrated Rural Development Project, and we began to realize
                    later all of the problems of it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were doing well, you were getting local input. What
                        was missing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: What was missing again was...what we really needed was a different kind
                    of mandate to say we could go out and design the project and we'd have five
                    million dollars, but it doesn't have to be a five year project. It could be a
                    twenty-year project. Because what we really needed was drip irrigation over a
                    much longer period of time. We put too much money into the project up front and
                    considering the drought and the poverty of the country, we didn't really
                    negotiate the local contributions, the recurrent costs. All the promises that
                    were made on recurrent costs and so on were never met. Of course, we waived
                    those ultimately because it's a poor country; they were suffering from drought
                    and so on. In hindsight we should have had a twenty-year project with drip
                    irrigation, making sure that we got the local contributions and recurring costs
                    paid for from the government budget.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there other projects you worked on from the Abidjan
                        office?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: I was supervising a group of people that were working on a number of
                    projects. We had the Veterinary Lab Facility in Mali, in Bamako, which was a
                    controversial project.</p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why was it controversial?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: Again, it was conceived as a regional project. It was to be a veterinary
                    lab in Bamako producing vaccines that could be used for livestock all over the
                    Sahel. There were various problems in terms of capacity, in terms of getting
                    vaccines to other countries. There were various production problems. Again, it's
                    difficult for me to remember some of the different projects, but there were many
                    people who felt this project was headed toward being a failure. I was at the
                    facility recently, and here it is almost thirty years down the road, and this
                    facility did function and operate on a cost recovery basis. It took a long time
                    for it to become viable, but it has become a viable facility.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Serving the region.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: And it's serving the region. It was just twenty years before it's
                    time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Or it took twenty years to get it right. What was the
                        understanding of the operation...the organizational arrangement?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: In those days it made a lot of sense, because the kinds of presence we
                    had in non-concentration countries was very small. We had one or two people in
                    Niamey, and we had one or two people in Bamako. I felt that the REDSO operation
                    made a lot of sense when we were keeping these kinds of micro-missions, if I can
                    call them that, in the countries we were serving. But I don't remember exactly
                    when the restrictions on the Korry Report were broken, but it was about this
                    period of time. And suddenly these small regional offices, as we call them,
                    became bi-lateral missions. Sometime between 1973 and the early eighties, we
                    suddenly had twenty-five or thirty Americans in Bamako, plus a local staff of
                    over a hundred. I think that's where we really lost our way, because we got into
                    such staff intensive offices, putting all these Americans in place. During this
                    period, 73-75, I felt we had the right balance of these very small offices,
                    largely with embassy support - we didn't have separate AID administrative
                    support and car pool support and so on. Then all of a sudden, after that changed
                    I guess it was in the late '70's and early '80's again in hindsight we were
                    taking the kinds of steps which kind of “de-responsibilized” (if that's a word)
                    local officials. We were doing everything for them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In your position, was REDSO involved in doing some of the
                        strategic planning for the Sahel Development Program at that point?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>STACEY: Yes, this was a period of time when there was some early thinking on the
                    Sahel Development Program. There was a lot of contact with the French at that
                    time. We had an AID officer at the embassy in Paris who participated in some of
                    the thinking on this. But it was a little bit later, in about 1975, and it was
                    after I left Abidjan and I had gone to the Club du Sahel, that we got much more
                    involved in that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Anything more on the REDSO experience?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: No, not at this time. I think what that period confirmed for me, Haven,
                    was that we could get into situations where we understood very poorly local
                    constraints, local motivations, what people were really doing. When we
                    understood those things poorly, on one hand, and, on the other hand, we had a
                    supply driven obligation schedule to commit funds, that you were pretty much
                    going to end up with a non-viable project in the long term.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of why we had that supply driven
                        pressure? Why were we being pushed to move ahead, ready or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: This was a period of time when there was a supplemental appropriation of
                    funds because of the drought in 1974-75, and I guess it stuck in my mind in
                    those days that the amount of money, the obligation authority that we had every
                    year, was not our biggest problem. It wasn't the level of money that was so
                    essential as it was the real understanding of what we were doing and how we were
                    doing it. That's why later on when the Sahel Development Program started, this
                    was during I guess the next phase of my career, the fact that a lot of people
                    worked very hard to get no year money for the Sahel Development Program. It
                    became very important because we wanted to diminish this pressure on obligation
                    schedules.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After the REDSO experience, what happened then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: After the REDSO experience, I went back to Washington for a short period
                    of time, about three months. I was going to go into a senior position in Africa
                    DP as I recall. Then I was asked to go to Paris to work with the DAC Chairman,
                    Maurice Williams at the time (He had been a former deputy administrator of AID)
                    to work on an idea of what to do in the post-drought period on the Sahel. There
                    had been some earlier conversations that I certainly wasn't a part of, between
                    the French and the Americans. There had been great concern about: if the Sahara
                    had returned to it's pre-drought AID levels, which were very, very small, that
                    this region would be condemned; that there were going to be recurring droughts
                    and recurring emergencies. How could we drought proof this region? How could we
                    insulate it from these weather-induced emergencies?</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you know who was the instigator in this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: Yes. The two people that were the primary instigators were Sam Adams, who
                    was the Assistant Administrator for Africa, and Jean Audibert, the Director of
                    Development in the French Ministry of Cooperation. Jean Audibert later went on
                    to be their ambassador in Algeria</p>
                <p>And he's retired now living in Paris. We see so many instances where the French
                    and the Americans can't agree on something, but the Club du Sahel really was a
                    French-American initiative.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why were the French interested in having us around? That
                        wasn't always the case.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: I suspect they decided, which was a rational decision in their eyes, they
                    couldn't bear the burden of this very poor and rather vulnerable region all
                    alone, and it would be in their best interest...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were they active in the relief operation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: Oh, yes. They were active in the relief operation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But not on the scale of the U.S.?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: Not on the scale of the U.S., but that's because so much of their food
                    aid goes through the European Community, so the EC was certainly active on the
                    scale of the U.S., but...we estimated that the drought, even though by some
                    estimates a hundred thousand lives were lost and millions of head of livestock,
                    the overall relief effort in '73-'74 cost about two billion dollars for the
                    entire world community. The thought that this might happen every few years,
                    especially in '73 seemed catastrophic, not just for loss of life but
                    catastrophic in terms of budgetary impact. The idea that maybe we could do
                    something to head this off became...certain people began talking about that. The
                    idea to explore what could be done, and if the Sahelians would be interested in
                    doing something on a regional basis, Maury Williams, the DAC Chairman was also
                    President Nixon's Drought Relief Coordinator, and so the green light was given
                    to Maury (this was unusual for the DAC Chairman who really is an international
                    civil servant although he works for the U.S.) to explore whether the Sahelian
                    countries were interested in some kind of initiative, and would they take the
                    lead on this, or what were they interested in. So Maury said he needed a staff
                    person from the French and one from the Americans to work on this to do the
                    legwork, the staff-work, to do the traveling and so I was asked too do that
                    which was a very lucky opportunity for me.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Building on the fact that you had this REDSO
                        experience.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: Yes, I think it was because I had the REDSO experience and by that time
                    had pretty decent French. It was difficult to work with the French unless you
                    could speak their language, they didn't like that at all. What I particularly
                    remember about this period in which the Sahel Development Program was created as
                    a line item in the U.S. budget - and as I mentioned it was no year money,
                    unheard of - was that those bureaucrats like ourselves that worked on this,
                    people in the AID office here in Washington, people in the AID missions in the
                    field, we never succeeded in creating a strong executive branch interest in this
                    initiative. We somehow created more of a Congressional interest in the
                    initiative.</p>
                <p>It was while I was in Paris at the Club du Sahel, that perhaps one of my more
                    memorable experiences occurred as an AID officer, in that the Senate held
                    hearings on the Sahel Development Program. In those days the Senate Foreign
                    Relations Committee had an Africa subcommittee, which was chaired by Hubert
                    Humphrey. I still considered myself a young and relatively inexperienced AID
                    officer, and was asked to come in from Paris and testify before Hubert Humphrey
                    on the Sahel Development Program. Which I did, and we laid out what we meant to
                    accomplish. I recall that the Congressional interest in this was positive and
                    later in my various dealings with the Hill and working with the Congress, I
                    never saw this kind of positive interest in anything else. Hubert Humphrey was
                    really interested. I do remember him really grilling me on who was going to be
                    in charge, because as far as he was concerned, if we were going to have a Sahel
                    Development Program, somebody had to be in charge, and it couldn't be an
                    American. He wanted to know who out there was in charge.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you say?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>STACEY: I said it was the Minister Coordinator, because the organization we were
                    working with, which had been created by the Sahelians at the time of the
                    drought, was the CILSS , which stands for the Interstate Committee for the Fight
                    Against Drought and Desertification. That's a French acronym. The CILSS was
                    governed by a Council of Ministers, and there was a lead minister who was called
                    the Minister Coordinator. The Minister Coordinator in those days was a man
                    called Buli Mamunga, who happened to be a colonel in the Niger army, but he was
                    also Niger's Minister of Rural Development and Agriculture. So I told Senator
                    Humphrey that the man in charge would be Buli Mamunga. He had a tough time
                    pronouncing that name, but we finally got it on the record. It's interesting
                    that Buli Mamunga was really quite a competent military person. Shortly after
                    those hearings, he was imprisoned by the president of Niger, who as we know, was
                    a bit of a dictator and quite an authoritarian person. Buli Mamunga spent seven
                    years in solitary confinement in a very tiny prison cell. I met him recently.
                    He's now the head of the Energy Agency in Niger, an oil company that does all of
                    the importing of oil. He said the way he kept his sanity in prison was a
                    combination of exercise and prayer, but with exercising every day for hours at a
                    time, he got to the point where he could do hundreds of push-ups. Interesting
                    man, and he's somebody that I did remember.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the concept of the program you were presenting to
                        Congress and Humphrey?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: The concept of the program was first of all to mobilize a great deal of
                    international support. There were many countries, which were not providing any
                    kind of assistance and were not engaged in this region of Africa. This had
                    largely been French domain in the Sahel. So the first element was to develop
                    some conceptual framework that could be of use to other donors. There was a
                    major study that was requested of MIT on the Sahel. I think Congress
                    appropriated a million dollars for MIT to do that study.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What became of that study?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>STACEY: Oh, it's filed in the libraries and so on. The study was not very
                    optimistic. It presented the Sahel as caught up in a series of vicious circles
                    that were not likely to result in any easy strategy of development. I haven't
                    looked at the MIT study in years and years, but it was not very useful to the
                    countries. We did a lot more work with various researchers on the Sahel, putting
                    forward some strategies for better dry land farming, more secure rain fed
                    farming. There was a major investment in the Regional Agro-Meteorologic Center
                    in Niamey. Part of the problem was in always knowing when to plant, knowing when
                    the rainy season was really installed. It was not unusual for farmers to lose
                    their seeds because they planted too soon and even to lose their seeds a second
                    time, and not to have enough seeds for planting the third time. So it was coming
                    up with better information and more secure forms of farming. We had an element
                    to open up new lands. Some of the regions of the Sahel where you did have more
                    fertile lands were precluded from human habitation because of various disease
                    factors. There was a major WHO-World Bank led program (started in part by USAID)
                    to open up some new areas for settlement, especially in the Volta. Some of the
                    Volta tributaries touched in the Sahel but some of this program was in the
                    northern tier of coastal countries as well. We were looking with a noted
                    American geographer out of Clark University at a whole dimension of settling
                    people into new lands where there could be more intensive farm production. A
                    large part of the activity in those years was basically putting together the
                    Club du Sahel, which was to be based in the OECD, and getting the Sahelian
                    concurrence in this. The idea of a Club was discussed extensively with the
                    Sahelian government, ministers, civil society representatives. They had their
                    ideas and we had our ideas but we didn't create a Club du Sahel until their
                    heads of state sat down and voted on it. That occurred in Mauritania in
                    1976.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's an unusual phenomena for OECD and the DAC to be
                        associated with, wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: The DAC was always considered non-operational, and when the Club du Sahel
                    idea came along, there were some DAC members who were uncomfortable with the
                    idea. As a matter of fact, the Germans outright opposed it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: On the grounds that it was getting the DAC into
                        operations?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: That's right. On the grounds that it was getting the DAC into operations
                    on the one hand, and the other thing is that the OECD of course, was considered
                    a club of developed countries.</p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>Now we had this group of developing countries, poorer African countries, that
                    were going to at least have their big toe under the tent of this developed
                    country club. The German government didn't like the idea at all, but they
                    decided not to oppose it. Under the OECD rules, if a country reserves on
                    something then you don't go ahead if you don't have an absolute consensus. The
                    Club was set up under some informal rules of the DAC. It's interesting that till
                    this day, the Club operates on the basis of a sufficient consensus whereas the
                    rest of the OECD has to suffer by operating on an absolute consensus, and
                    there's a big difference. An absolute consensus means that often your work is
                    the lowest common denominator on what the thirty countries can agree on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We'll come back to that. Who was the driving force or
                        forces that brought this into being despite the rather unusual
                        situation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: I think the driving forces were a few key Africans, people like Buli
                    Mamunga and Ali Sissai who was the Malian executive secretary of CILSS. Sam
                    Adams and Jean Audibert were very convincing with some of their other colleagues
                    in the DAC. Ultimately the Club was formed but only after the Sahelians had
                    officially voted on it. I think to his credit, Maury Williams made sure that we
                    had a high level of participation at the first meeting of the Club du Sahel,
                    which was held in Dakar in 1976. He organized a Tidewater meeting in Dakar at
                    the same time. I don't know if you recall that the Tidewater meetings were
                    informal off the record meetings that all of the heads of development agencies
                    had once a year. The name comes from the first meeting, which was held in
                    Tidewater, Maryland. Heretofore all the Tidewater meetings had been held in some
                    DAC member country, either Germany, Japan, France or the U.S. This was the first
                    time that it was held in a developing country. The German minister refused to
                    come, because he saw exactly what Mr. Williams was doing. What he was doing was
                    making sure that we had the first meeting of the Club du Sahel was at
                    ministerial level. The U.S. was represented by Dan Parker of Parker Pens. He was
                    the AID Administrator in those days. We had people at that level for the first
                    meeting of the Club. What was interesting is that the mandate of the Club du
                    Sahel that was agreed upon at that meeting was on one page (as a matter of fact
                    it was on a half a page), and for twenty years the Club du Sahel existed on that
                    half page mandate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did it say? Do you remember?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: It laid out in very general terms, what the objective was, what it
                    intended to do, what were the areas of focus. It was a very, very general
                    mandate having virtually no legal basis.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who wrote it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>STACEY: It was written by myself and David Shear, late in the night the first day
                    of the meeting along with Ann De Lattre who was my French colleague on the
                    French side. We showed it to Maury Williams and the people who were leading the
                    Sahelian side and it was basically adopted. The point is that sometimes
                    something that is very brief and very general and informal is very workable. I'm
                    convinced that when the history of development is written, we're going to find a
                    graveyard of declarations, resolutions, conventions, all kinds of formal
                    documents that were negotiated as a result of meetings that resulted in nothing.
                    In the case of this Club meeting we had this very informal mandate, we had an
                    informal structure, it was all voluntary, it was inclusive, there were no formal
                    qualifications for membership. If you engaged in the work, committed to the
                    Sahel, the door was open. The Club secretariat operated on a year-to-year basis.
                    We had to secure voluntary funding year by year. The staff was there on year by
                    year contracts. It was the difference between an institution and a fora - an
                    informal forum.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There was a structure that was agreed to at that time.
                        What was it? How did it work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: There was a structure that was agreed to at that time which was more one
                    of convenience. We established an overall working group - north/south. These
                    were the early days of so called north-south dialogue. We felt in the Club that
                    we'd gone beyond that. We had the first north-south action group. We had gone
                    beyond dialogue and had something we were agreeing to work on. We set up a
                    working group that had Sahelians, Americans, French, Dutch, Canadians - and this
                    working group had a series of sub-working groups with security and
                    anti-desertification being the central themes. We had working groups organized
                    around irrigated farming, dry land farming, fisheries and the opening of new
                    lands. Very much of a production focus. Then we had transversal working groups
                    working on human resources, environment. Later on the number of working groups
                    became unmanageable. The irrigated working group for instance was dropped,
                    because it became clear that for a considerable period of time the way we were
                    going to get the most increases in food production was going to come from
                    improved dry land farming. The capital costs implied in irrigated farming were
                    astronomical relative to the market and the return you could get from that kind
                    of investment. So the irrigated working group fell aside and ultimately
                    fisheries did as well. We began to get more focused groups.</p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>One of the things that I do remember is the question of big monopolies in
                    marketing was considered a big impediment. The state marketing boards were
                    considered major impediments to freeing up some of the creative energies of
                    Sahelian farmers and even of people who operated in the marketing of foods. The
                    countries were enormously suspicious of the private sector. There had been too
                    many examples in the past of private traders in food - hoarding food, so this
                    was a very difficult dialogue. Long before structural adjustment came along, in
                    the context of the Club, we had this enormously frank series of meetings and
                    exchanges on food and cereals pricing. A lot of the analytical work was led by
                    Elliot Berg, from our side, and Dirk Striker, who is up at the Fletcher School
                    now. It resulted in some changes in policy on cereals marketing that were so
                    important for the region. I think one of the early successes of the club was the
                    changes in...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: To follow that line, how did it come about if there was
                        such resistance to this kind of change?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>How did you bring it about?</p>
                <p>STACEY: I think through the kinds of dialogue we had, and the kinds of exchanges
                    and papers. This stretched out over two years, maybe more - three years. The
                    countries became convinced that in terms of the objectives they had set for
                    themselves in food production, and improving the food security of their people,
                    that this was a step they had to take. The risk, in terms of private traders
                    exploiting the people and so on were such that they could be taken. There were
                    ways to deal with these issues. But my point was that the Club was a place, long
                    before structural adjustment came along, where some major policy issues were not
                    only discussed, but where policy reform took place as a result of those
                    discussions. Our agenda on policy reform was very specific. We weren't looking
                    at an exchange rate policy, or at fiscal policy, or at tax and customs. But much
                    at food pricing and state monopolies in food, and serious marketing that wasn't
                    working.</p>
                <p>Matter of fact, we had a great example in Burkina Faso one year when we were
                    working down there. The government had set a price of thirty-eight or forty
                    francs CFA a kilo that they would pay for sorghum, which was considered an
                    incentive price. The marketing board had set that. The farmers planted and it
                    rained that year, so they had a big harvest. When it came time for the marketing
                    board to begin to purchase, they didn't have any money. They hadn't received the
                    necessary authorities from the Ministry of Finance to purchase at the prices
                    they said they could purchase. So they had all this sorghum sitting in the
                    markets there ready to buy, while the trucks came in from Ghana, and from Ivory
                    Coast and from Togo. According to the data we had, they bought sorghum between
                    four and eight CFA a kilo. So the next year the government said “Okay, we're
                    offering forty-five CFA a kilo, and everyone said we don't believe you” and they
                    didn't plant enough to have surpluses. So you can see there is the capacity
                    there to produce surpluses, but what to do with them was always a problem. We
                    began to understand that the farmers could produce. This wasn't the problem. It
                    was the marketing and pricing.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who were the key players in bringing about this change?
                        You mentioned Elliot Berg, but on the Sahelian side I gather there was
                        considerable opposition to these arguments.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: Oh, there was considerable opposition. There were a series of ministers
                    who were very important, because ultimately this debate got into the CILSS
                    Council of Ministers, and these were all the Ministers of Agriculture. But some
                    of the key players I remember are the former Minister of Agriculture in Mali who
                    is now retired, Engola Traore, was a key member. Unfortunately I can't remember
                    all the names of the Sahelians, but for me it was an indication that there's a
                    lot of formality about our business. The way we negotiate agreements, the way
                    the World Bank negotiates loans, etc. There is an indication to me that
                    sometimes one of the best ways to do policy dialogue and to get policy change is
                    through informality as well. We were also dealing with regional issues. These
                    markets were very porous. You couldn't get your pricing right in one country and
                    have it wrong in the other country. In a sense, these were things the countries
                    had to move forward together on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there other policy issues that you were
                        addressing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: This was the major one that I recall during the time when I was there.
                    There was a lot of discussions, of course, of environment, of land tenure, and
                    the question of natural resource management. That didn't bear fruit until about
                    1984 when the Sahelians announced a regional strategy on desertification, which
                    preceded by fifteen years the national convention on desertification. So some of
                    their early experience on anti desertification measures was very useful in terms
                    of illuminating...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the basic elements of their strategy? What was
                        the understanding of the desertification situation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: Not that the strategy was comprehensive or necessarily designed to be
                    successful. There were technical measures in terms of better water retention,
                    various ways to better retain moisture. There was getting information to farmers
                    via rural radio in terms of planting, but also there was a whole element of
                    forestry, and planting of trees, especially the reforestation. There was an
                    element of more rational grazing, because traditionally the pastoralists have
                    used natural forests to graze in, so there was going to be improved access and
                    more rational rotation of grazing land in national forests. There was an element
                    of supplemental feeding of animals, growing better fodder crops. There was an
                    element of restraint on water points, because the location of wells that had
                    been drilled during the sixties actually resulted in excessive concentrations of
                    animals in areas where you didn't have adequate holding capacity. All of this
                    was put together in a comprehensive study.</p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the understanding, because at the time wasn't
                        there a discussion that the desert just was creeping on and on? What was the
                        understanding then about the desert creep?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: There wasn't a lot of understanding. I'd go so far as to say there still
                    isn't among a lot of people. Actually, if you look at the maps of the Sahel and
                    the rainfall patterns over a hundred year period, you see that the desert
                    advances and retreats during various times. During the fifties you had a period
                    of rather abundant rainfall, and people were actually cultivating further north
                    than they had done in many, many decades. When the drought came in 1973-74,
                    there was a sharp reversal of a longtime trend. You could almost see the
                    movement of where they could cultivate and where they could graze about two
                    hundred kilometers further southward. No one knew if this drought was going to
                    be a new long dry period and then there was going to be a new wet period. I
                    think what we managed to accomplish through the discussions was acknowledgment
                    that desertification was largely a human induced condition. This was not
                    primarily weather related. They had, by that time, sufficient examples about
                    what happened with over-grazing, over-stocking of animals, inappropriate siting
                    of water points, inappropriate agricultural practices, which just mine the soils
                    and take out the nutrients. A lot of the soils out there are phosphate
                    deficient. There's enough information now that people could acknowledge that
                    desertification was largely human causes, and it wasn't so much the desert
                    advancing southward, as it was spots of desertification that were occurring
                    where you had excessive concentrations of animals.</p>
                <p>Population growth - we tried to create the first demographic dialogue in the
                    Sahel. One of the projects we supported in this period was the beginning of the
                    Sahel Institute, which is based in Bamako. We financed a demographic unit called
                    Demographics in Development, because we could clearly see that the Sahel was
                    headed for some of the highest population growth rates in the world. The only
                    thing that kept them down below three percent in those days was the high infant
                    mortality rates and the disease, especially malaria. As infant mortality rates
                    began to fall in the eighties, the Sahel now has some of the highest population
                    growth in the world.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk about some of the programs. Livestock, as you
                        mentioned, was a major issue. What were we trying to do with livestock
                        programs?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>STACEY: I'm not sure we knew what we were trying to do with the livestock
                    programs. I mean obviously livestock was a source of food, and source of
                    survival for a lot of people, especially the pastoralists, so our initial
                    efforts in livestock were to improve pasturage, better ability for them to graze
                    in some of the traditional areas, improved animal health through vaccines and so
                    on, and an attempt to improve marketing possibilities in the coastal states,
                    which have traditionally been their markets. Unfortunately we, as development
                    experts, didn't have our handles on all of the leaders, because it was about
                    that time that other countries started dumping meat into coastal West Africa..
                    New Zealand, Australia and then later on the European community, so that little
                    by little the availability of cheap meat from other parts of the world began to
                    undercut the Sahelian market. We were just working on the Sahelian supply side
                    of the equation. They began actually in the eighties to lose their market share
                    in livestock. That's changed now with the devaluation of CFA franc, and the fact
                    that at least Europe's mountain of meat surplus is somewhat diminished. We
                    pulled out of livestock eventually. We had a lot of programs in livestock, but
                    those programs were almost universally evaluated negatively.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the main, aside from the market problems,
                        problems with them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: The main problem was essentially the market problem, but also ways of
                    delivering assistance. We didn't have a lot of experience working with really
                    nomadic peoples. So the kinds of problems we were working on which had to do
                    with mixed farming and trying to get people into more sedentarized modes of
                    production. There has been more sedentarization now in a lot of people even in
                    Mauritania have abandoned herding. What you find now is that the herds are owned
                    by big landowners, or people who live in the cities and they hire people out to
                    graze them. Earlier this was all small herders.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did we try to do any range land management?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: We were doing range land management and were trying to improve some of
                    the grazing areas and get more rational grazing patterns. That's where we got
                    into problems with local politics and local land tenure issues. I guess I have
                    difficulty remembering all the reasons, but it was generally considered that
                    livestock wasn't working as a sector.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What do you think were some of the more successful
                        pursuits of the Club du Sahel during this time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>STACEY: The most important thing we did at this point was to put together an
                    international partnership around a group of northern countries and a group of
                    southern countries. This had never really been done before. Even the word
                    partnership, which everyone is over using today, is really nothing new. We used
                    the word back when the Club was first started. I think that the real success
                    here was developing the framework for real informal off the record honest
                    dialogue. It was amazing how many meetings you could get into that had “wooden
                    language”, a lot of speech making, position taking, rhetorical, but no real
                    exchange of issues. The Club established this basis for that kind of dialogue.
                    It was a place where people could really say what they thought, and there
                    weren't necessarily going to be any consequences for speaking honestly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you bring that about? Have lots of large Club
                        meetings each year?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: We had large club meetings, but I think it was some of the principals who
                    were directing the Club at time. Both on the Sahelian side and in the OECD, they
                    were insisting that we had to have this kind of dialogue that this had to be the
                    place for this kind of frank and honest exchange. Where we failed was in our
                    definition of partnership. We really had some of these strategies laid out in
                    desertification and food security, we succeeded in mobilizing a lot more aid
                    money. The aid levels of the Sahel practically tripled in just a few years after
                    1974. Where it failed was the partnership basis was undermined because the
                    Sahelian countries were not able to put up the recurrent costs. They were not
                    able to put up the local counterparts in many instances. Rather than waiting and
                    insisting on that, the donors began to waive the local cost requirements. They
                    began to waive the recurrent cost requirements. We got into the period of the
                    early eighties where gap filling was so important. We had structural adjustment.
                    There were gaps that had to be filled. There was a certain through put of money
                    that had to go through each national budget, otherwise they couldn't pay their
                    multilateral debt. We basically began to waive all those requirements, and pick
                    up even one hundred percent local cost financing on these projects. We basically
                    undermined our own partnership agreement. It seemed like the right thing to do
                    at the time, because these countries were so poor, they had just gone through
                    this terrible drought and so on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why would this undermine the partnership?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: Because the very things that we were seeking in the partnership agreement
                    of their taking the lead, their taking primary responsibility, creating
                    capacity, assuming ownership - all of the things that we talk about today were
                    premised on these programs becoming their priorities, and these priorities being
                    manifest in their own budgets. But we wouldn't wait around on that. And maybe
                    the countries knew that if they waited long enough, we'd say that we'd pay all
                    of it.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mean we were more concerned about the situation than
                        they were?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: Yes, perhaps.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you respond to that? We'll come back to the
                        general subject later but there's always the concern about doing something
                        in a crisis or emergency. How long do you sit and wait until the other
                        partner finally comes around to understanding it or prepared to put up the
                        resources?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: I'm not sure there's an easy answer to that. I think we probably
                    shouldn't have started down this partnership track saying that this is the way
                    it's going to work We can do this if you do your share. We basically should have
                    come in and said this is not workable right now. I mean, after we started this
                    idea, we didn't call it the new partnership, as they're talking about now. We
                    called it a more mature partnership. This was in 1976, so in seeking a more
                    mature partnership, we defined what it ideally would entail, but it was
                    unrealistic because the countries either couldn't or wouldn't meet their
                    responsibilities.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At that time there was concern about financing recurrent

                </p>
                <p>STACEY: There was a major recurrent cost study.</p>

                </p>
                <p>STACEY: What triggered that was the conclusion that the countries couldn't do
                    this and they weren't doing it, and the basis of the study was to see what
                    should be done. I wasn't there when the study was done, so I can't tell you what
                    the conclusions were.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the African members of the Club du Sahel.
                        Obviously the name Sahel defines it but not all of them were strictly Sahel
                        countries. How was this territory defined?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: Initially the Sahel was defined by the nine countries - in those days it
                    was eight countries - that were members of CILSS. The CILSS was a formal
                    institution in contrast to the Club, which was informal. The CILSS was created
                    by the countries and the heads of state would meet every three years. There was
                    a convention, which grants all of the people working for CILSS immunity when
                    they cross borders and go into other countries to do their work. They had tax
                    privileges and things like that.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's an international organization.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: That's right. It's an international, intergovernmental organization, but
                    it has formal statutes and it has a convention, which covers all of the people
                    who work at the agri-met center at the CILSS and at the Sahel Institute. The
                    Club, on the other hand, was not an institute; it was just a forum. Initially
                    the work was limited to those eight countries. It's only been in recent years
                    that the Club has begun to work outside of the Sahel, probably in the last ten
                    years. It's because the Sahelians also know that their long-term future is tied
                    in with West Africa. As a development unit, the Sahel makes no sense. But in a
                    longer-term context, it's their economic and other relationships with the
                    coastal countries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We'll come back to that. In that period, the CILSS grew
                        out of the drought. Why would they come together? Why didn't we just deal
                        with each country separately? Why have a CILSS at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: Because there were a series of common problems that required common
                    solutions. In many cases, some of the work that needed to be done, whether it
                    was research on more drought resistant crops, or information and so on, there
                    were economies of scale in working on all of these countries together. They saw
                    this themselves. They also felt that in the longer term, in terms of their
                    relations with the coastal states, especially the big ones like Ivory Coast and
                    Nigeria, that they had a better chance if they would hang together. They wanted
                    to institutionalize the word Sahel. They wanted it to mean something. This was a
                    special part of West Africa that had special issues, special needs, special
                    challenges. If you look for instance at the makeup of The Economic Community of
                    West Africa, the Sahelian states make up half of the sixteen members. Chad is
                    not a member. The other eight makeup half, and they don't feel like they have
                    half the weight. So one of the aspects of CILSS now is to coordinate Sahelian
                    positions in the context of their evolving situation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I could see that originally it was the drought and the
                        famine and being able to make an appeal, but now what is the glue that holds
                        them together? Countries tend to fly apart with internal problems and go
                        down their own track.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: Believe it or not, there really is common identity here among Sahelian
                    people. I mean, Malian people think of themselves as Sahelian. So do people in
                    Senegal. I was rather surprised at the depth of this identity. Beyond that it is
                    the drought, this common threat of drought, desertification, the common
                    environment they live in that really holds them together. In many ways, it's
                    more solid than other regional groupings, because of what they've gone through
                    and the common experience.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I see. On the donor side, how many donors were there? Do
                        you remember?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>STACEY: Originally there were five who came into the Club after the U.S. and
                    France started it. There was Canada, Netherlands, and Italy. Today there are
                    thirteen donors, so little by little there has been an expansion of the
                    countries that are contributing. Initially the U.S. was putting up sixty percent
                    of the budget, then it came down to about forty percent, then down to thirty
                    five percent, and the U.S. pays now seventeen percent of the Club budget.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mean the total program?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: Yes, the program for the Secretariat of the Club. In terms of a donor in
                    the region, the U.S. has always been somewhere between four and five percent,
                    and they may even be down to three percent now.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What scale of resources are we talking about? Initially
                        what did you start out with?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: We're talking about...initially the total flows into the eight country
                    region were probably a little over eight hundred million dollars a year.
                    Eventually that got up to nearly three billion a year from all sources. It's not
                    that now, but at the high water mark it was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you know where most of that money went? Was it in
                        agriculture or livestock?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: A lot of it went into agriculture, but a lot of it went into transport.
                    This region was so transport deficient, which became one of the major costs in
                    terms of moving food around during the drought. So some of the big donors,
                    especially the European Community, began to put resources into infrastructure
                    and roads and even improving some of the railways.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Regional?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: Regional transport. There's been a phenomenal improvement in rural roads
                    and other transport in the Sahel over the last twenty years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the World Bank join the group?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: Yes, the World Bank joined the group.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I thought originally it wasn't very interested.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>STACEY: Yes, originally they weren't. They'd never really done much regional
                    lending, and I think the donors who had the most difficulty in working
                    regionally in the Club were the World Bank and the Africa Development Bank since
                    they don't do regional loans. The EC was always a difficult partner as well,
                    because they have their very particular programming procedures that tie in with
                    Lome Convention. And the way that Lome provided for the programming of regional
                    funds was not consistent with the way that we were trying to work with the
                    Sahelians. The EC funds could be committed if two ministers from a country made
                    the request. It really didn't have to be a regional project that had a
                    regionalized scope to it anyway.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the donors talk among themselves in terms of improving
                        their level of effort, their procedures, their approach?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: Not in the early days, no. In the early days, it was more one of trying
                    to agree on some common strategies, some common approaches, understanding the
                    region better, having this dialogue with the Sahelians. It's only been in the
                    past few years that I've seen the donors working more on the aid delivery and
                    how to improve their aid instruments. There may have been some talk about that
                    early on, but I wouldn't say it was a serious effort.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Anything else about the early period? We'll come back to
                        the later period, but is there anything in the early period we haven't
                        touched on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: As we come back to this later period in the Club—because I did come back
                    to the Club later on in my career—the next period that covers Southern Africa
                    and Zimbabwe and then a return to the Sahel you might want discuss.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Rather to shifting to Southern Africa at this point, let's
                        continue with the Sahel Development Program. You left the program in what
                        year in the earlier stage?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: I left in 1978, at very short notice, request of Golda Butcher, who was
                    the Assistant Administrator for Africa, to take on a study of Southern Africa
                    that the Congress had mandated to AID of development needs in Southern Africa —
                    a region that we didn't know a great deal about. I left in '78 and had an
                    opportunity to come back to the Sahel after my retirement from AID in 1992. It
                    was very interesting to come back some twenty years plus to the scene of one's
                    earlier crimes, and to try to do an assessment of what had happened.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That gives an opportunity for an interesting perspective,
                        a twenty-year gap in a regional program and how it evolved. What was the
                        situation in the Sahel in 1992 when you went back?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>STACEY: The situation in the Sahel was an under-appreciated food security
                    success, if I can call it that. And let me qualify that a bit. Many of the
                    studies of the Sahel in the '70's including the MIT study that the U.S.
                    government spent a million dollars on, predicted a series of recurring
                    emergencies, recurring droughts, expensive relief operations. Organizations like
                    FAO were calling for pre-positioning of large stacks of emergency food, etc. The
                    happy result is that for the last fourteen years, food aid to the Sahel has gone
                    down continuously. There was another drought in 1984, one that was even more
                    severe than 1974, and, at that time, the food was over-programmed. In 1985 they
                    had a good harvest and, of course, a lot of the food aid arrived late and they
                    had more food aid than they needed. Prices fell, and at that time they had a
                    consensus by both the Sahelians and the donors that something had to be done to
                    discipline food aid.</p>
                <p>There was a Food Aid Charter negotiated between 1984 and 1990, which lays out all
                    of the do's and don'ts of food aid. It gives priority to local purchase of food
                    grains, rather than importation from the U.S. or Europe. It was the first
                    example that I know of where a group of poor developing countries and donors
                    negotiated an instrument to try to reduced dependency on something. There was a
                    feeling that countries had become far too dependent on food aid in many ways,
                    that food aid was becoming inappropriately requested in some cases and
                    inappropriately programmed in other cases. This Food Aid Charter seems to have
                    worked, because as I said food aid has declined for the past twelve years.
                    Eighteen out of the last twenty years in the Sahel, rainfall has been below
                    average. Last year they had a overall harvest across the nine countries of
                    eleven million tons, which was a new record. There's been a diversification of
                    food production - lot of different kinds of crops are produced. Much more
                    pari-urban production. It's been a food security success because the regional
                    market worked. You had food going across borders through normal commercial
                    channels. If you contrast that with the horn of Africa, that's a very
                    significant factor. So that's what I found in '90 in general.</p>
                <p>I could say a second success that was really unnoticed about the Sahel, was how
                    well they had managed conflict and vulnerability. There had been conflict in the
                    north of Mali and Niger, between certain cultivator groups. There had been
                    conflict in the Senegal Basin, between Mauritania and Senegal. There had been
                    conflict in the Casamance, but in contrast to Southern Africa the conflict never
                    really got out of hand and never got to the point of really becoming terribly
                    explosive. The Sahelians have a long history of managing conflict situations so
                    that I found what I thought what was a very successful Sahelian effort.</p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>On the other hand, I found a Club, which was in some crisis. The reason the Club
                    du Sahel was in crisis was that the counterpart organization that we worked
                    with, the CILSS, was in crisis. What had happened was that the CILSS had misused
                    some funds during a period - EC and other donor funds which were used not for
                    the intentions they were given- not that the money was stolen, but they were
                    funds that legitimately could have been requested back by the donors. The CILSS
                    itself was bankrupt. They didn't even have the funds from their own governments
                    too close the organization or let go the staff they had and pay them what they
                    would be due. So we had a major crisis. There was an audit and a program to
                    restructure the organization. We had to close the books on the old organization.
                    All the staff had to be let go, paid their severance pay and then a new CILSS
                    had to be created. I arrived just at the time that was happening. It was an
                    awkward role for the Club, because the Club, the Secretariat in Paris, was
                    supposed to be a neutral interlocutor. Instead they had become a hammer for the
                    donors to reshape this organization.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's go back a little before you get into that. What were
                        the factors that contributed to the decline of the CILSS? Was it losing
                        interest, or success causing people to go their own way? What was the
                        original impetus behind the CILSS decline?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: I think the CILSS had an excessively large role in implementing regional
                    projects rather than coordinating their implementation, perhaps by the national
                    states. In taking on this role, this came at a time when a lot of donors,
                    especially the EC, had a lot of regional money to place. Frankly the CILSS was
                    among the better performing regional organizations in Africa. There were over
                    two hundred different inter- governmental organizations in Africa, and most of
                    them don't perform very well. Since the CILSS were one of the better performing
                    ones, there was a temptation to put more and more project money in it. That
                    created the condition where there was a certain lack of capacity in the
                    financial management and so on, and they got themselves in trouble. You could
                    combine that with the fact that in terms of the local payments that the States
                    were supposed to make for the organization, which weren't very heavy, they were
                    heavily in arrears, so that the CILSS was about ninety-nine percent dependent on
                    external financing. Those two factors came together and really created a crisis
                    where the donors basically said that they were willing to bail the CILSS out.
                    They felt that the States had to be willing to do something also. What they
                    demanded was that the core central unit of the CILSS, which is about twenty-five
                    staff members, that all of the salaries and recurrent costs of that part of the
                    organization would be paid for by the States. That line wouldn't be crossed. The
                    arrears were mostly paid up, with the exception of Niger, which still had a
                    large chunk of arrears, but with Cape Verde taking the lead and Mali as well,
                    began to get the States to pay up.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you think some of the motivation that started the CILSS
                        had waned because of the change of political and economic
                        circumstances?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>STACEY: There was a certain perception that the CILSS had done it's job, the food
                    security had been improved, they had some success on anti-desertification and
                    natural resource management. There was a feeling that they didn't have a role to
                    play in regional integration. That was a misreading of the importance of the
                    organization. If you look at the three most important regional organizations in
                    West Africa, UEMOA, which is basically the CFA zone, which really focuses on
                    monetary policy, ECOWAS, which is a bigger organization of sixteen countries.
                    But that is basically an integration of trade organizations. The CILSS has
                    really evolved into a center of excellence on issues like agro-meteorology,
                    population—the demographic in the Sahel Institute is excellent, it's world
                    class. It's got a lot of expertise in areas of natural resource management that
                    could be of use to the Horn of Africa for instance. So there is a center of
                    excellence that has a certain role to play, and it has a role to play beyond the
                    Sahel. Some of the long-term projections of some of the Dutch institutes show
                    that as a result of global warming we're going to get a drying trend in all of
                    West Africa. Some of the northern tier of countries of Ghana, Ivory Coast and so
                    on, are projected to suffer an increasing drying trend. I suspect a lot of the
                    knowledge that CILSS has would be of use to the coastal countries in the future.
                    So I would argue it's a very valuable institution and the fact that we were able
                    to restructure it, close it down and reopen it - it's still excessively
                    dependent on donor financing.</p>
                <p>The answer to that, which is something I've started in motion just recently, is
                    to create a foundation endowing an intergovernmental organization. I don't think
                    it's been done. But the way we put together the endowment plan is the States
                    would take the first fifty-one percent of the endowment. This would mean advance
                    contributions on their annual payments. The other forty-nine percent would be
                    raised privately. It would not be a fund that would be looking for donor
                    financing. That plan is before the Ministers of Finance now. During my return to
                    the Club, the important thing was to get the Club Secretariat back into a more
                    neutral role.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the characteristics of the restructuring of the
                        CILSS?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>STACEY: They created a central unit of twenty-three positions, I believe it was,
                    which was going to be entirely supported by the States. The entire group of
                    projects was then grouped into six major programs. Two were based in Niamey at
                    the Agrimet Center. Those were the major programs in research and in technical
                    training, because they have a major training program there in integrated pest
                    management. Then there were two programs in Bamako, at the Sahel Institute. One
                    is the demographics population program, and the second is the environmental
                    education program. They have an excellent program introducing environmental
                    curricula into the school system. The two major programs that were policy
                    oriented, that were Food Security and Natural Resource Management, were to be
                    based in Ouagadougou. The Executive Secretary was to have four counselors,
                    senior staff: one for Food Security, one for Natural Resource Management, one
                    for Administration and one for Communications. The new structuring was put
                    together so that the major programs in the other countries did not operate under
                    the vertical top down management from the Executive Secretary. The Executive
                    Secretary's power was in information, and getting that information presented
                    upward to the Heads of State and to the Council of Ministers. In terms of
                    managing the technical aspects of the project, that was really left up to the
                    project managers and their two Director Generals, one for the Agrimet Center,
                    and one for the Sahel Institute. So it was to decentralize management, and then
                    there were management centers in each of the three capitals. There was an
                    Internal Auditor position that was established that reported not to the
                    Executive Secretary, but to the Council of Ministers, and annually did his own
                    audits and a separate report.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the prime leader in this reform?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: The donors. It ultimately came down to a situation where they said if the
                    States aren't able to do this, because there was a major audit that was done by
                    Coopers and Lybrand, and after the Heads of State agreed to the recommendations
                    of the audit, it really became clear that CILSS was going to lose a enormous
                    amount of funding if these reforms weren't undertaken. It had to be the States
                    who took the lead on it. I'm not sure of any one person who was...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No leading person in the Sahelian group?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: The Minister from Cape Verde. As a country Cape Verde really took the
                    lead. During the period of 1991-1994, the President of Cape Verde was the
                    president of the CILSS. He took personal leave, including traveling around to
                    the other countries to get them to pay up their arrears and to really get behind
                    this reform program. So I would say that the mover and shaker was little Cape
                    Verde.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why do you think Cape Verde was so fired up about
                        this?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>STACEY: First of all it was their turn to have this rotating presidency. But Cape
                    Verdeans have always played a very creative leadership role in the CILSS and in
                    the Sahel. In some ways though, the most Sahelian of all the countries, in a
                    good year they only produce ten percent of all their food requirements, and yet
                    they've done a remarkable job of trying to reforest some areas to prevent
                    erosion, building roads from stones all over the islands. They really see
                    themselves as a country that benefits from the expertise in CILSS. The last two
                    directors from Agromet have come from Cape Verde, and some of the people they
                    have put into regional organizations have been world class.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Their future very much depended on linking into some sort
                        of regional complex for trade and development issues.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: On the donor side, during this time, we had a tough situation in that the
                    Sahara already had very high levels of aid. In a sense the Club had done it's
                    job in increasing donor flows to the Sahel and as a result we had a group of
                    countries who still ranked among the poorest in the world, who, a lot of people
                    would say, were not developing - in other words, managing vulnerability,
                    managing crisis, is not a development success. It certainly doesn't show up in
                    the data. There was an improvement in infant mortality rates, which of course
                    increased the population growth rate. The donors felt that one, there was a lot
                    of aid going in there; two, that it wasn't having an impact and wasn't
                    succeeding because look at the aid flows and look at the per capita GDP, the
                    literacy rates, the number of kids that aren't in school. At that time donors
                    began “picking winners and losers” as I call it. Coming up with various criteria
                    for trying to concentrate their aid on countries that were going to progress
                    more rapidly or countries that had a better approach to democracy or human
                    rights, countries who had gone through these kinds of democratic
                    transitions.</p>
                <p>In the process of trying to pick these winners or losers, it was difficult. For
                    instance, I had come to the Club as officially nominated by the U.S. government.
                    My nomination had to go through the White House even. Then immediately AID
                    starts closing down. It closed down in Cape Verde, closed down in Chad, later
                    closed down in Niger and Gambia, because of coup d'etat. It also closed down in
                    Burkina Faso. Now the World Bank thinks Burkina Faso, Chad and Gambia are all
                    good performers, but we didn't reopen. So it was a difficult time. A lot of
                    donors were willing to consider their regional programs with CILSS, but they
                    were closing down bilaterally. You could see the double standard setting in.
                    Even if Kenya perhaps had a worse record on corruption, human rights and
                    democracy, we weren't going to close down in Kenya. Even if Egypt has issues
                    with human rights and democracy, we weren't going to close down in Egypt. This
                    double standard was not lost on the Sahelians. In a sense, we had to change the
                    debate.</p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>Elliot Berg was instrumental in working with us on this, because the Sahelians
                    had to begin to see that the high level of aid dependency that had resulted the
                    last twenty years was not a healthy situation. It worked against capacity
                    building. It tended to maybe de-responsibilize their officials. We all had a
                    mutual interest in financing a sustainable development from things other than
                    aid as we've known it-ODA. How do we make that shift to finance development from
                    trade and investment over time, and not just this aid dependency conundrum that
                    we had gotten into. We have had a very healthy dialogue with the Sahelians
                    during the last five years on this. And I think that it's not an easy answer,
                    because there are all sorts of impediments other than policies which prevent the
                    kind of private investment coming in that you would like to see. We like to
                    think that it's as simplistic as policy, but there's human capital,
                    infrastructure and being land locked, and these are major factors.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All the things that make them dependent on outside
                        expertise that we're saying they should be relieved of in some respect. How
                        do you balance this dependency on one hand, and a requirement for external
                        support and expertise and so on, on the other hand?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: We did a major exercise; we actually had two exercises that ran in
                    parallel after we got through the CILSS restructuring. One was called Sahel
                    Twenty-One, where we had set up structures in all of the countries that brought
                    in civil society, farmer's groups, women's groups, herder's groups,
                    municipalities, private sectors, into a dialogue about where did they see their
                    country in its region, going in the next twenty to thirty years. What were the
                    priorities and issues. We wanted them to focus on a regional vision but with
                    their locality very much in mind. All of this eventually came together after
                    about eighteen months in Sahel Twenty-One, which is a statement of their
                    regional vision and is very interesting, which we can come back to. What we did
                    is Cooperation Twenty-One, in which we looked at this last thirty years of aid
                    flows to the Sahel - magnitude, impact, imprint, if we couldn't measure impact,
                    what worked well, what didn't work well, what were the problems with the view of
                    ultimately to getting a consensus on the need for an exit strategy from this aid
                    dependence. These two exercises ran parallel but touched at various times
                    because one of the conclusions we had was that the instruments of aid that we
                    used were, in many cases, a part of the problem. That inadvertently issues of
                    ownership, participation, and sustainability were undermined by the very
                    instruments that we used. So through this Cooperation Twenty-One exercise, we
                    were able to make some recommendations. The first word that came out of the
                    recommendations was restraint. So much is driven by the need to obligate and
                    disperse and fill gaps.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: “Results” is the word today.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: And results. It is particularly disturbing to me that people want to show
                    results within a year or you don't get the next budget tranche. Anyway we can
                    come back to that later on.</p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What happened to the Club as a group? Is it still
                        functioning?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: Yes, the Club is functioning more than ever because we also did a
                    multi-donor evaluation of the Club. Five donors joined together and did an
                    evaluation- Germany, Canada, the United States, the Netherlands and France.
                    There was an evaluation, which basically said this mandate that we had from 1976
                    which was on one page of paper was really no longer adequate. The Sahel had
                    changed and there was a greater capacity within the Sahelian institutions and we
                    had to look again at the mandate. What we did was we used these twin exercises
                    of Sahel Twenty-One and Cooperation Twenty-One to draft up a new mandate for the
                    Club, which was called the Second Generation Contract which was approved in
                    Banjul in 1997. It's called the Banjul memorandum. It's about four pages
                    long.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You drafted this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: Yes, I drafted it along with my French colleagues, and it went through
                    several innovations as the donors and the Sahelians studied it. It was approved
                    by the Heads of State and the Donor Ministers. We got most of the ministers and
                    we got some non-ministers. It's a great new mandate for the Club.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Does it change the orientation or basic mission?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>STACEY: Oh, yes. There had been a confusion about what the Club was. A lot of
                    people thought the Club du Sahel was the Secretariat sitting at the OECD in
                    Paris. That was not the Club du Sahel. The Club du Sahel was the forum where all
                    of us came together, and the Sahelians were as much a part of the Club as OECD
                    members. One of my objectives was to make the Club even more inclusive and we
                    brought the municipalities in. There is an association of municipalities in West
                    Africa now that's very well represented with some very dynamic people.
                    Development is more decentralized now at the local levels. We brought in the
                    private sector in the form of the West Africa Enterprise Network, which is a
                    network of African entrepreneurs covering thirteen countries. We brought in NGOs
                    - both Sahelian and some northern NGOs. That's the Club; the Secretariat that
                    had been in Paris, probably due to some very dynamic people who had been there
                    in the past, had frankly become a bit too dominant. The Sahelians had complained
                    to me that one, the Club was too pushy, and two, that every time they'd just get
                    on board something that the Club had been working on, then the Club would jump
                    off to something else. We were probably joining a bit of the donor fadism that
                    comes along - these fads that we all fall victim to. It became clear that the
                    most important thing in my job description was to be a good listener. I had to
                    listen to the Sahelians first and foremost, then listen to the donors. It had to
                    be emphasized that the Club was just a forum that could disappear tomorrow. It
                    was not an institution. It also had to be Sahelian led. They had to see this as
                    an instrument of their regional strategy— their window to the world, their
                    mechanism to coordinate the donors. A regional roundtable, if you will. During
                    the last five years we've made some real progress on that. Only time will tell,
                    but the Club had to be restructured as well. It wasn't adequate to just
                    restructure the CILSS.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The membership in the Club is quite a large group, if you
                        have all the members there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: It's enlarged. What started off as basically five countries supporting
                    the Club is now thirteen. We have strong support from Switzerland, Austria;
                    Denmark has now joined and I think Sweden is about to join. Also the UK recently
                    joined as well as Portugal. It's interesting that the UK joined, because they
                    now have a much better working relation with the French than they did before,
                    since the Labor Government was elected in England and the Socialist Government
                    was elected in France. They think that the Anglo-Franco divide in West Africa,
                    this language divide, really has to be breached. You really have to get past
                    that. They're actively working on that together. So the British felt it was in
                    their interest to join the Club du Sahel.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Anyone on the Sahelian side? They were members of the
                        Club, I presume?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: Oh, yes. They're members of the Club. The rotating presidency has now
                    passed to Gambia. As you know, Gambia is now being...</p>
                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>The president of the Club is always a donor. This is something new I created as
                    well because I felt the Director of the Club du Sahel had to be a much more of a
                    quiet broker and he couldn't be out there representing the donor viewpoint. So
                    we created a rotating president of the Club du Sahel that rotates among the
                    donors. During the time I was there, Canada, France, and Germany had it and now
                    Switzerland has it. I think it'll pass to the Dutch next. They're the ones who
                    write the tough letters saying “This is what the donors feel.” Before it was the
                    Club Director that was doing that, and I felt it was inappropriate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But the Sahelians participate but they're sort of
                        second.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: No, they're not second. Every three years we have a meeting with the
                    heads of state, and once a year we have a meeting with the Ministers. They
                    basically determine the agendas of those meetings. We work with them very
                    closely on the papers and things like that but quite honestly, how much
                    leadership they provide in the Club depends frequently on the head of state. The
                    Cape Verde President took a very active role and he saw the Club as an important
                    instrument. The Gambian president who is currently there is a young former
                    military officer who came to power in the coup. He's thirty years old. He's gone
                    through an election which a lot of people had questions with. He certainly has
                    cleaned up the corruption in Gambia but he doesn't operate in the same way as
                    the Cape Verde president does. Next year the presidency passes to Mali. I expect
                    something very interesting to happen during the time that Mali has it. This is
                    the first time in the twenty-five year history of CILSS that Mali has had the
                    rotating presidency.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How is the program different than it was twenty years
                        ago?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: The Club program or the CILSS program?</p>

                        The Club program of what the donors are doing. Are they doing the same thing
                        that they were doing twenty years ago?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: They're doing a lot of the same things they were doing twenty years ago
                    in the regional programs, because there's been a continuity of support for some
                    of these institutions, as the institutions have upgraded their capabilities.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're talking about the Agrimet Center?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>STACEY: The Agrimet Center, the Sahelian Institute. In terms of bilateral
                    programs, these have largely moved away from what we were seeing in the early
                    eighties in terms of integrated rural development projects, much more to a form
                    of sector programs. A lot more of the donor aid has come in the form of program
                    aid in order to try to support some of the adjustment efforts. You have strong
                    proliferation of NGO activities that we didn't have in the early days. Both
                    local NGOs and international NGOs. There seems to be a kind of dichotomy that's
                    developing where the government aid might go through sector adjustment programs
                    or investment programs. On the other hand, people-to-people activities through
                    NGOs with the idea that they are going to have more of an impact on poverty. One
                    of the conclusions of our Cooperation Twenty-One exercise was that many of the
                    problems of donor instruments, which undermine local participation and ownership
                    - these same problems occur in the NGO programs as well. They don't fess up to
                    these problems but it's true.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There hasn't been a major shift in the sector emphasis of
                        the donor program?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: There's been some difficulty because in some cases the Sahelian
                    governments are having difficulty meeting some of the requirements for the
                    sector programs. Those countries that have undertaken adjustment programs have
                    had some more general budget support, but the six sector investment programs are
                    really just getting started. There's a great interest in helping education
                    because the Sahel is so much further behind in education, yet so many of the
                    reforms that are being undertaken are politically very difficult for the
                    countries. We have some of the most overpaid teachers in the world in this
                    region.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Are they French or are they local?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: Local teachers but through the years, because of the strength of the
                    unions especially in the French system, they have pretty nice salaries in
                    relative terms. So frequently, your education budgets in these
                    countries—sometimes ninety-five percent of the budget—will be eaten up by
                    teacher's salaries and there's nothing left over to do anything else. So you
                    have a very high cost, low quality, low output education system.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is the education system still the narrow structure of a
                        few going all the way up rather than broad based?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>STACEY: That's right. One of the things I've found at the Club is that education
                    was really missing from our work program and yet I recognized that this is a
                    very crowded area of activity. We had a view that there were some very dynamic
                    things happening in community-based education in local languages. We wanted to
                    find out more about what was going on, so we did a series of case studies.
                    Forty-eight communities were covered, where some sort of local literacy program
                    had taken root and had really developed in the sense that it had been
                    capitalized in various ways. The literacy had been capitalized on socially,
                    through health programs, or it had been capitalized on financially by setting up
                    some sort of an export cooperative. Some cases had been capitalized in different
                    ways, technically as well. We wanted to find out how this came about. What we
                    found was that communities are able to unleash a lot of capacity from local
                    communities to do things: to really wrestle with daily development problems
                    simply by literacy in local languages. It's an enormously powerful thing in
                    building or unleashing local capacity.</p>
                <p>The second thing we found is that the formal education systems are operating in
                    ways almost like silos that are divorced from the daily development problems
                    that people are dealing with. Much more attention needs to be put into
                    non-formal education, but the World Bank and some of the donors are concerned
                    about that because they don't want to emphasize non-formal education too much.
                    It might be that you are suggesting that non-formal education is an acceptable
                    substitute for a good formal education and I don't want to do that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You spoke earlier about one of your interests in building
                        the local associations, municipalities, other groups and so on. What were
                        those and what was your objective in that area.?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: All of the countries in the region had listed as part of their
                    democratization programs decentralization. There are various moves going on
                    right now to decentralize authorities. As you know, the old French systems were
                    highly centralized. There's also a kind of “bottom up” decentralization going
                    on, just as I described it a few minutes ago, through local communities gaining
                    capacity and moving into the vacuum of development activities that the state has
                    vacated or never filled. So you have these two things happening at once and they
                    meet at the municipality level. Mali, I think this year, will elect 710 mayors
                    in 710 towns. Every one of those guys has got an idea about what he wants to do.
                    Donors are lining up now to try to assist the decentralization process by trying
                    to assist certain municipalities. This will invariably get them into competing
                    for municipalities.</p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>What we tried to do is set up a program. It's a UNDP program run out of Cotonou,
                    which assists municipalities, and is run by a man named Jean Pierre Along Basse.
                    We set up a program with Jean Pierre to develop a way of analyzing local
                    economies so that the mayor or city council of a town can use this as an
                    instrument to find out exactly what their local economy is. Where is the dynamic
                    part of their local economy? What's growing? What's stagnant? Where is their tax
                    base? What should they be investing in in the future, in terms of accelerating
                    overall growth and expanding their revenue base? Pretty simple models and tools.
                    These programs, which we call Ecolock, we did a series of case studies of about
                    six towns so far, and we conducted a series of training programs with the mayors
                    and municipalities not in capital cities but in secondary towns.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You also talked about forming a new association too?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: Yes. The Club du Sahel had a major conference in Cape Verde the second
                    year I was there, on land tenure and decentralization. That conference was
                    conducted in six languages: French, English and four local languages. We had a
                    large number of herders and farmers groups that had been chosen. Each country
                    had chosen their farmer and herder representatives to come to this meeting. As a
                    result of this meeting with these groups, which came together for the first time
                    from the nine countries, they decided that they wanted to form what they called
                    “Platform Payson,” which is an organization of national associations of farmers
                    and herders into a regional platform that would represent their regional
                    interests as well. It was this platform that was the moving group for the Sahel
                    Twenty-One, which helped paint their vision of the region. What's interesting
                    about these groups is that when they come together, they seem to recognize that
                    as countries in this rapidly changing world that has small land locked
                    countries, that the solution to their national vulnerabilities and national
                    weaknesses are regional solutions. It is in the context of working well with
                    their neighbors that their development prospects are enhanced and their
                    participation in the global economy is enhanced.</p>

                <p>STACEY: This was a vision of local farming communities.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And they got this larger picture?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: They have a much larger picture and it's very interesting, that's why
                    this Sahel Twenty-One statement is... They really think that just left to their
                    own national borders and own national governments and economies they're pretty
                    much doomed to long term poverty.</p>

                </p>
                <p>STACEY: There was the Women's Platform, which had not yet become as dynamic as
                    the farmer's. And then just as I was leaving there was a Youth Platform trying
                    to get formed, but there was always the danger of these groups forming not
                    because they want to do a serious work program, but because there's always
                    meetings to go to and per diem's to be had, and you have to be careful that
                    they're forming around serious intentions and not just to benefit from
                    opportunistic money that always seems to be available.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You alluded to the larger concept of the region, the
                        coastal area: I understand that one of your interests at this time was how
                        the Sahelian countries and the coastal countries might need to join
                        together. What was your understanding of the situation and what were you
                        thinking about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: The training arrangement we had with CILSS had always limited the Club's
                    ability to break out of that geographic constraint. Just before I arrived at the
                    Club, an exercise was started with a project called Synergy, which was put in
                    the African Development Bank at Abidjan funded by the Club. It was a small group
                    of Sahelians who were charged, along with the Club Secretariat in Paris, to
                    complete a West African long-term perspective study which was a study of
                    eighteen countries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was your initiative?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: It was initiative taken before I arrived. I completed it and we published
                    it. The idea was to put the Sahel at the center and to cover a broader region of
                    eighteen countries, and to look at this region not through a short-term series
                    of still photographs, but a real moving picture that really covered from 1960
                    with projections to the year 2020. So we really covered a whole period of sixty
                    years. The hypothesis being that you see a very different picture than you see -
                    for instance there are nearly eight million Sahelians who have left the Sahel.
                    Don't forget the Sahelian rural population would be fifty percent larger today
                    than it is if you hadn't had this spatial redistribution of population. The
                    World Bank has a projection that the population of Niger will stabilize at
                    seventy-one million people in the year 2020. Everyone knows that the population
                    of Niger will never reach seventy-one million. These people will become
                    dispersed They have become very good at doing that.</p>
                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>The long-term study also was premised on two mega trends that this region was
                    going through of dramatic change due to two major factors: one was the exposure
                    of the region to competition. It was unavoidable, it was happening, and even
                    through they weren't well placed to participate in global economy or their
                    membership in the World Trade Organization, nonetheless this region was really
                    being exposed to external competition. Secondly, the population dynamics, and
                    not just the population growth but the movement of farmers from rural areas to
                    cities, the movement of farmers from rural areas closer to markets, the fact
                    that farmers were more and more in touch with markets going back to some of the
                    old theories on the importance of the density of markets. We found a lot of
                    dynamic changes going on, so we published this study. There was some concern
                    that the Club was becoming a Club of West Africa. There was a bit of tension
                    with our Sahelian colleagues over the publication of the study, because it was
                    not done with them, it was done more with the African Development Bank. The
                    CILSS opted out on this one. After we published it, they decided they wanted to
                    do Sahel Twenty-One, because they wanted to develop their own vision of the
                    Sahel within the context of West Africa. So I think the positive side of
                    publishing the Wolpe study, we called it, was that it stimulated the Sahel
                    Twenty-One exercise. The UNDP had taken on the task of doing national long-term
                    perspective studies after the World Bank had published their famous Long Term
                    Perspective on Africa in 1989. We felt by just doing a series of national
                    long-term perspective studies, they were really missing something. So we wanted
                    to complement that with the West Africa study.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the UNDP involved in that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: No, they weren't. Unfortunately the man who was running the Africa
                    Futures Program out of Abidjan was very much locked into his own trajectory and
                    didn't want to be involved.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What's your understanding then of the relationships of the
                        Sahel to the rest of West Africa in economic and political terms?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>STACEY: The high degree of interdependence had always been acknowledged. The
                    question isn't whether the Sahelians see their relationship with the coastal
                    states, it's whether the coastal states see the importance of making sure that
                    the Sahel develops at the same time. You have had higher growth in Ivory Coast
                    and Ghana, and under a normal set of circumstances you would have had that in
                    Nigeria as well, than you would have in Niger or Chad. Everything that happens
                    in Nigeria is fundamental for Niger. The comparative advantages that the Sahel
                    might have are very limited - livestock and human capital. It's interesting that
                    a lot of the Sahelians that did locate down the coast, many of them are not just
                    working as house servants or people in the informal economy there, they're
                    business men and women, they're in the professions. So the coastal countries,
                    when they were importing a lot of this meat from the EC and from other parts of
                    New Zealand and Australia (what really was dumping) were not really working to
                    the advantage of the Sahel. I think that much more intensive dialogue is needed
                    on issues of livestock and regional meat production. You see some of the coastal
                    states now investing in their own meat production, which really doesn't make a
                    lot of sense. The Agrimet Center in Niamey has the capacity to cover all of West
                    Africa, yet you see some of the other countries on the coast investing in their
                    own agro-meteorological services when they could buy those services. This could
                    be a way to get the Agromet Center to reduce it's aid dependence, if it could
                    sell it's services to the coastal states. So there area whole series of things
                    which require important dialogue between the CILSS and Sahelian countries and
                    the coastal countries.</p>
                <p>One of the challenges for the Club now is to set up some of the informal
                    structures that have been the hallmark of the Club to do that. For instance, if
                    they want to do anything serious about the river basins, and I'm not talking
                    about dams and irrigation, but about watershed management, desertification, and
                    protecting the watershed. You can't do that without bringing Guinea into the
                    picture, because the Fruta General in Guinea is the key to the whole watershed.
                    So the CILSS, as they begin a program on this, which they hope to do because
                    there's a regional program called for under the International Convention of
                    Desertification, then they would bring Guinea into a variable geometry working
                    relationship on that. That's the way the CILSS and the Club are evolving
                    now.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you see anybody on the African side that has a vision
                        of this sort of thing? Is there any impetus there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: There's one person I have some real hopes for there. It may be premature,
                    but I did have the occasion when I was working on the Global Coalition for
                    Africa a few years ago, to spend a bit of time with General Obasanjo, who was in
                    a period of retirement then. Now that he's assumed the Presidency of Nigeria, I
                    know that he's very sensitive to the kind of regional leadership and vision that
                    Nigeria should have for West Africa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And on the donor side?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>STACEY: On the donor side, I think that's more of a mixed bag. The French, in
                    recent years, have begun to diversify their interests. You find very significant
                    French programs in Mozambique, in South Africa, in Angola. The old Ministry of
                    Cooperation is no more. That part of the French government had a special
                    relationship with the former colonies. Instead, everything is now being put
                    under the CFD (the Caisse Francaise de Developpement) which means that the
                    programs for Mozambique and Latin America and former colonies will all be run
                    out of the same offices, and supposedly subjected to the same criteria. The
                    Dutch are still in many ways, the most progressive in terms of aid instruments,
                    but they too are going through a retrenchment in the number of bilateral
                    programs. My biggest worry is that as people reduce for whatever reasons, either
                    they want more performing countries, or they have administrative cost problems
                    or whatever, they reduce the number of bilateral missions that they can
                    undertake worldwide.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the U.S.?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: Including the U.S. Invariably those cuts fall on the small and
                    politically insignificant countries, meaning Chad and Gambia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the vision for the West Africa area. Is there
                        any thinking on that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: For five years now there have been two attempts to write a new West
                    Africa regional strategy and all of these efforts have been stillborn. It's not
                    just AID's problem. I would say the donors in general are having trouble
                    articulating a broader West Africa strategy because they have some serious and
                    legitimate concerns about the regional organizations that they would have to
                    work with. ECOWAS, for all of its promise, frankly has become more of a military
                    and peacekeeping organization in the last few years. As the former senior
                    African representative at the IMF, Mambo Butori, told me one day “You don't need
                    regional bureaucrats to get goods and services moving across borders more
                    efficiently.” So you have this difficult situation where the EC, because they
                    have large amounts of regional money and other donors have put significant
                    resources into the ECOWAS Secretariat, quite honestly I would say you have a
                    problem there of some poorly articulated projects, lack of political will among
                    the countries to implement them, and a lot of this money just goes into paying
                    the salaries of regional bureaucrats which are really not needed. So the problem
                    is how do you articulate a regional strategy when you've got that kind of
                    impediment.</p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>The only answer I have is that you find ways to help the real actors who are
                    integrating the region. These are economic actors. They are small businessmen,
                    like the West African Enterprise Network; they're these groups like the
                    municipalities. One of the things that's missing from our arsenal are things
                    that are both regional and local. We don't have aid instruments that are
                    simultaneously regional and decentralized at the same time. How do we work with
                    a group of municipalities, for instance?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's go back for a minute to what started this interest
                        in the Sahel, which was the desertification situation. What is the
                        understanding of that phenomenon which started the Sahel program?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: You've got a contradictory situation now. Don't forget that the Sahel in
                    1960 was only thirteen percent urbanized. It is now forty-five percent
                    urbanized. That means it's not that you had a reduction of population in rural
                    areas, because the population growth rate has assured that, but you have had a
                    lot of farmers and rural producers that have moved closer to markets. So what
                    you see is an intensification of pari-urban agriculture that has come about. The
                    farmers are using more sustainable techniques. Kano, Nigeria is our most
                    interesting example, although it's not officially in the Sahel. It's a city of
                    over two million people and you have about six hundred and twenty-five
                    millimeters of rain annually, and yet the city is virtually self-sufficient in a
                    broad range of agricultural and dairy products, poultry products-eggs, cheese
                    cereals and vegetables. This comes not from any aid programs. Farmers are
                    re-capitalizing their soils with a combination of compost, green manure, urban
                    waste and some chemical fertilizers. That's what Sahelian agriculture in a sense
                    is going to look like in the future. You're getting a different kind of
                    intensified production around Bamako, around Ouagadougou, whereas around the
                    more remote Sahelian areas they're still practicing non-sustainable agriculture.
                    You still have people trying to rotate their lands, they're still mining the
                    soils and it's still highly vulnerable. Those people have learned different
                    techniques. But the most significant thing that has happened is that if you look
                    at the source of family income, in 1974 rural families in the Sahel were maybe
                    eighty percent dependent on either farming or herding for their income. Today
                    that's about forty percent, according to some of the estimates we have.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where does the rest come from?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>STACEY: The rest comes from family members who have migrated out of the Sahel and
                    those who are in the city; it comes from more diversified activities such as
                    handicrafts and selling various products. They diversified their family
                    strategies in interesting ways. Where the farmers have moved closer to markets,
                    and again going back to the fact that there was only thirteen percent urbanized,
                    we also see in the cities now a rather dramatic drop in family size. Especially
                    where women have had opportunities for education or where the families have
                    become urbanized, family size seems to drop very rapidly even in one generation.
                    We would conclude that urbanization has been a good thing for the Sahel. It has
                    helped intensify production; it has helped give a greater density to the market
                    for agricultural producers; and it seems to give greater opportunity for
                    delivering both education and family services to Sahelians.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Any change in the livestock situation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: The biggest change in the livestock situation was as a result of the 1992
                    devaluation. Between 1984 and 1992, we didn't have the data but herd size was
                    really going up I'm sure, because the traditional markets on the coast were very
                    difficult with all this surplus meat being dumped there. Lower quality meat cuts
                    that weren't even consumable in Europe, and they were selling them for
                    practically nothing down in the coastal countries. But after the 1992
                    devaluation, we had a tremendous increase in exports out of the Sahel. In some
                    cases, countries doubled their exports of livestock in one year. Every
                    indication is that has continued. They may not exactly have the same competitive
                    edge they had right after the devaluation, but on the whole the devaluation has
                    very much helped agricultural exports and livestock. What you have now is a
                    situation...when I was in Abidjan you'd go in the supermarket and you'd find so
                    much imported food because the overvalued exchange rate subsidized those imports
                    basically. What you have to know is that African farmers in West Africa are
                    beginning to capture their own regional markets, maybe even more than beginning.
                    That's why I say that the key to the Sahelian food security has been that this
                    regional market functions. The Sahel is producing surpluses. Mali exported six
                    hundred thousand tons of rice last year. No one imagined that Mali could do
                    that. Niger exported three million tons of sorghum and millet last year. No one
                    imagined that they could grow that much.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's shift now closer to home. Given that long- term
                        perspective, what do you think is the core of the contribution of the U.S.
                        assistance program?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: Overall? To the Sahel?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. Has it been significant or not effective?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>STACEY: I think the areas of greatest significance - some are not obvious yet-
                    but clearly the projects that have had a durable impact were those that
                    involved, in many cases, improved water supply, improved healthcare, improvement
                    in infant mortality. So programs in health were considered highly successful,
                    and you can see that data to prove that. Roads and infrastructure have had a
                    stimulating effect on rural production.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was that a major area of US assistance?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: Not for US assistance, but it was a major area of assistance for some
                    donors, although the U.S. did some in the early days. Where the U.S. has made a
                    contribution, and it's very difficult to attribute, is in Ag research and Ag
                    extension, many of the programs we tried in the seventies. Don't forget, there's
                    probably been a spillover of technology from Northern Nigeria as well, because
                    you're in the same climatic zone, and the U.S. had invested heavily in the
                    agricultural faculties at Ahmadu Bello University in Northern Nigeria. I have no
                    doubt there's been a spillover from those excellent programs, which were in the
                    sixties. What happened is that as the density of market changed, as the policy
                    reforms began to have an effect, and especially after the devaluation, where we
                    see this intensification of production in the pari-urban agricultural zone, I'm
                    absolutely convinced that US efforts in research and extension are a part of
                    that. Improved seed, integrated pest management, all of these things are a part
                    of that. These are areas we had invested heavily in.</p>
                <p>The area of greatest disappointment, and this is for all donors including the
                    U.S., would be in institution building and capacity building. A lot of the
                    efforts in this, bringing in very expensive technical assistance, training
                    people and so on, the difficult budgetary and financial situation of the country
                    really undermined a lot of the institutional development projects. They couldn't
                    pay the costs. Donors weren't willing to continue.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was not much of a priority in the rush to do
                        things?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: It was a priority, but in many cases, at least for the countries - you
                    see it in the universities for instance, in higher education where the
                    universities have suffered - some of the institutions we invested in like the
                    Niger River Commission...we had a big documentation center we were supporting,
                    building up a data base on the Niger River...well, the countries never supported
                    this and they've completely fallen into disuse. So in general our review of aid
                    over the past twenty years shows that the least successful area was institution
                    and capacity building.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Within individual countries you say that's the problem? We
                        haven't helped create within Mali and Niger institutions and

                <p>STACEY: The efforts we made, not that they were improperly designed or misguided,
                    but the people that we trained, the people that were the key people that we were
                    supposed to work with they didn't continue much beyond the projects after we
                    phased out simply because the governments were either unwilling or unable to pay
                    the local costs. All of the things we put into agreements on that didn't
                    work.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The governments didn't have institutional development as a
                        priority?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: Again, some of these governments went through crises, coup d'etats, but
                    I'm trying to think of specific institutions. There were a few that got
                    privatized like the veterinary lab in Mali which survived. A lot of the other
                    research centers and things like that, which we supported ...some of them may be
                    still limping along.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>STACEY: It's not a question of the point of view. It's only in the last two or
                    three years that there's been any real positive growth in these economies and
                    there's only one or two of them. Gambia, for instance, has expanded its revenue
                    collection. Until the countries can get some sort of a tax base and a revenue
                    collection that they can expand, they cannot begin to pick up these kinds of
                    continuing costs...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What you're saying in effect is that building up and
                        sustaining institutional growth in these countries is mainly and economic
                        and financial issue?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: It's a policy issue as well. The governments in some cases, haven't put
                    the right people in or supported the institutions. It's not just financial
                    obviously; it is policy. Certainly the areas of most success were that the
                    donors provided for the Sahel a kind of psychological sense of confidence. They
                    knew that they had enough support there that they weren't going to starve to
                    death, and that they really could work on the food security issues. There was an
                    element of confidence building, that they weren't condemned to these recurring
                    droughts and emergencies and a lot of confidence that I think the donors helped
                    instill, that the Sahel was still a productive place.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's turn now to your work in Southern Africa and
                        Zimbabwe. When did you get started in that? Of course, you were in Southern
                        Africa earlier; we talked about that. When did you return?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                <p>STACEY: During the period that I had been working in the Sahel, there had been
                    some movement on the Southern Africa front. The Rhodesian War was quite intense
                    during this period. During the period of 1979-1980, Henry Kissinger was
                    increasingly involving himself in looking for a Rhodesia settlement. There were
                    all kinds of talk of significant amounts of money to be set aside to buy out the
                    white farmers of Rhodesia to try to bring this war to a settlement. There were
                    some pretty ideas floating around; and it was in that context that certain
                    members of the Senate staff, people like Pauline Baker, who is now with the
                    Aspen Institute but at that time was on the Hill; Frank Balance who was working
                    for Senator Jacob Javits; Dick McCall, who was also working as a Senate
                    staffer... This group of people was able to get into the legislation a mandate
                    for AID to conduct a comprehensive needs analysis of development in Southern
                    Africa. As an agency, we realized at that time how little we knew of the overall
                    region, particularly some of the former Portuguese colonies where language and
                    data were difficult. For Rhodesia, where we had virtually nobody on the ground,
                    reporting was difficult. I was brought in to do this study on rather short
                    notice, after the previous director of the study and Mrs. Butcher were unable to
                    agree on some of the aspects of the study.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There was a previous study, but it had political problems
                        or do you remember?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: An earlier study?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: On Southern Africa, before you got there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: Gosh, you know I don't know what the problems were. It was
                    unacceptable.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the scope of what you were asked to take on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: The scope was to get much more of an African input into the study. They
                    did want us to get out into the region and get some of the Southern Africans
                    involved. There were a number of US scholars, African-Americans, that people
                    wanted involved. It was a very difficult kind of a political equation in terms
                    of dealing with various people who insisted on having a role. The contract had
                    already been lent to a minority firm here to work on this study, and there were
                    some problems with the management of that company. Although the individuals
                    working on the study were competent, in terms of the management of that company,
                    there were some concerns about making sure that the finances of the company were
                    properly managed. We established a joint working group with the State
                    Department, at least in name. State wanted to keep an oversight in this and what
                    AID was doing. We were in frequent contact with the Hill and we began to quietly
                    put together some outside contributors to the study, not just Southern Africans
                    who would work with us but also good contact with Europeans who had more
                    experience with Southern Africa than we did.</p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>At the time the countries in the region, the so-called Front Line states, some of
                    the leadership there had realized that it was not just sufficient to be against
                    apartheid, they had to be for something also. The whole dimension of the
                    so-called Front Line states had been drawn up to oppose apartheid, and in
                    looking beyond apartheid, really thinking about Southern Africa in a
                    post-apartheid era, what was it that they were for? What kind of economic
                    cooperation and integration? The study that we were doing we thought, if handled
                    properly, that some of these ideas could help the states, who were wrestling
                    with this idea of what was it they wanted to do economically and developmentally
                    with their region after apartheid met it's end. One of the significant things I
                    remember about this period was that it put me personally in touch with a group
                    of Europeans who were working very quietly on the preliminary ideas for SADCC.
                    This group included David Hood, who was the Africa person at the Carnegie
                    Foundation; Maurice Foley who was the head of the Development Directorate of
                    Southern Africa, the EC, a former British labor member of Parliament; and David
                    Anderson, who was British and was the Deputy Secretary General of the
                    Commonwealth Secretariat. To my pleasant surprise, they invited me into their
                    discussion group on one condition only. The condition was that I couldn't come
                    with anyone else from the U.S. government, so whenever I went to Brussels to see
                    them, I had to figure some way to ditch the embassy representative or they
                    wouldn't let me into the meetings.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because they wanted to keep it quiet?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: They wanted to keep it very quiet. The focus here was developmental, it
                    was economic; they didn't want political reporting on what they were trying to
                    do. What they were trying to do was to formulate a series of sound ideas but to
                    work with two of the Southern Africa Heads of State, in order to set down the
                    first precepts of SADCC, as the post-apartheid manifestation of the so called
                    Front Line states. That enabled me to attend a series of meetings, most of them
                    in Brussels; one of them was in New York. It enabled me through this group to
                    have contact with quite a number of knowledgeable people on Rhodesia, Mozambique
                    and Angola that normally would not have worked with us, because there was a lot
                    of suspicions about the U.S. government. We were seen as supporters of South
                    Africa. The political tensions were such that we had to be almost as invisible
                    as possible in order to have access to the people who could help us inform and
                    enlighten this study so that we were not just limited to the official and known
                    sources of information on the region.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the scope of the study?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>STACEY: The scope of the study covered all of Southern Africa, including Angola,
                    Zambia, Malawi, Mozambique, Zimbabwe, the BLS countries and Namibia. To define
                    those needs, of course, very heterogeneous, the needs in Mozambique were very
                    different from those in South Africa or Zambia. There was sufficient
                    heterogeneity among the countries that we had to do individual country studies
                    as well as an overall regional study.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These were functional studies, weren't they?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: These were functional studies.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Such as?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: Fisheries, agriculture, transportation, human resources as I recall. So
                    we had functional studies, country studies, and then an overall summary. One of
                    the more difficult aspects of this was getting State clearance on some of the
                    language we wanted to use in the study. We had a sense that this was an
                    opportunity, with the Congress, to present a needs analysis that would create a
                    favorable climate for appropriations for what we wanted to do in the future as
                    an agency. So we had AID self-interest here, which in some ways was different
                    from State.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How long did the study take?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: The study took just about a year. We had a very short time frame because
                    of when the Congress wanted it. We were handicapped in that we couldn't travel
                    to some of these countries. We couldn't travel to Rhodesia or Namibia. We did
                    travel to Mozambique, but even that was difficult in this time period. I recall
                    going on one mission to Mozambique where we lived in the ambassador's residence
                    because the U.S. Ambassador had long ago left. Since the currency was absolutely
                    worthless in Mozambique, you couldn't go down to the store and buy any kind of
                    food. So we had to bring our own food stored in our suitcases, and bring tin
                    goods in and we lived in and worked out of the ambassador's residence and ate
                    canned food while we did our Mozambique mission.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you remember the overall cost of the study?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0060" n="Page0060"/>
                <p>STACEY: The cost as I recall was a million dollars. A healthy part of this went
                    to the consulting firm called Pacific Associates. A young economist named Gary
                    Walker was very able on this study, as well as some other people. There were a
                    couple specific things that I do recall of the study that were notable. One was
                    that one of the major resources - fisheries- off the Angola and Namibia coast,
                    there had been a major study done by the UN Council on the Namibia and what was
                    happening to these fishery resources, which was a real catastrophe in the
                    making. We could never get that report out the UN Council on the Namibia largely
                    due to the Soviet Union, whose fishing fleets were the ones really over
                    exploiting these waters in the most horrendous way. So access to
                    information...it was really amazing how little reliable data there was on
                    Southern Africa, even in '78-'79. A lot of the official data that was being put
                    out, both by the South African government and the Rhodesian government, was
                    deliberately manipulated to make things either look better or worse than they
                    were, depending on the sectors.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there real substantive or process issues in preparing
                        this report?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: There were certainly a lot of process issues. Again I'm trying to recall.
                    There was an important element here of being able to bring in some of the U.S.
                    academic community who had some strong views on Southern Africa, and to bring in
                    views of Southern Africans. We were able to organize a major conference to
                    review some of these drafts that had been pulled together by the various
                    consultants, and so the substantive studies, the country studies, we had a good
                    two or three day discussion as I recall. Like many of those kinds of meetings,
                    they're not satisfactory. In other words, we got some political statements, we
                    got some specific criticisms, we got a bit of praise. We were able to do some
                    further work on the draft as a result of this meeting. But you never get the
                    real kind of political validation that you would like to get from these groups
                    that have their own agenda. I do recall that there were a number of African
                    American academics. The people recall are Elliot Skinner, Walter Johnson, people
                    who had some very strong views on how some of these issues should be presented.
                    We were trying to steer away from some of the unproductive rhetoric of
                    anti-colonialism and so on that were not going to be helpful in terms of the
                    Congress. Since this study had been mandated by the Congress, as much as we
                    wanted our audience to be the Southern Africans, clearly the primary audience
                    was the Congress.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were they trying to steer it in some way?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: Yes, they were trying to steer it. I was fortunate to have a couple of
                    good AID people, Mike Feldstein and Charlie Blankstein.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: My question was: did the Congress try to manipulate or
                        steer what you were coming out with, in the substance or direction of the

                </p>
                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>STACEY: I don't recall that Congress tried to steer it too much. There were a
                    handful of staff people up there who had their own ideas about what they wanted
                    to see, and they were willing to work with us quietly and have discussions with
                    us. They wanted to clearly set rationale for a much stronger US involvement in
                    the future development of Southern Africa. They saw this as much as anything not
                    a study that would come up with definitive paradigms for the future, but a study
                    that was going to help educate parts of the Congress, parts of the Executive
                    Branch, about this region which a lot of people knew very little about.</p>

                        this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: The issues with the State Department were what we were proposing to do in
                    Mozambique and Angola, where there were certain kinds of both policy and
                    legislative restrictions. There were issues with the State Department about
                    South Africa, and the contact with certain groups or individuals they didn't
                    want us to have contact with. The same went for Rhodesia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the results of the report? What happened to
                        it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: The report was finally sent to the Senate. As I recall they had maybe one
                    subcommittee hearing on the report. In general, it seemed to be well received.
                    There was a certain level of disbelief within the State Department that this was
                    going to result in anything, and that we would get any useful legislative
                    authorities as a result of the study. Of course, the study preceded by a year or
                    so the successful negotiations at Lancaster House. So in my view the study was
                    useful in that it helped prepare various people in the government for the
                    eventual opening of programs in both Zimbabwe and SADCC as well, after we made a
                    significant pledge of assistance at Lancaster House. I do recall that, for
                    instance, on the Zimbabwe section of the report, we were able to dig into the
                    land issue, which was and still is the most volatile political economic issue in
                    Zimbabwe. It prepared the ground for a very practical approach to this, because
                    after doing this study we understood better that it would be catastrophic for
                    the country if there was an extensive flight of white farmers, managers and
                    technical people who were in the government, and that given other factors, you
                    weren't going to solve the land problem by redistributing productive assets to
                    small farmers. This was something that had to be very carefully considered. When
                    the eventual break came at Lancaster House, and the U.S. pledged seventy-five
                    million dollars a year for three years to support implementation of the program,
                    the Southern Africa Needs Study gave us a lot of useful information in terms of
                    some of those early programs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you have a sense of how it was received in Southern
                        Africa?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                <p>STACEY: It was received in Southern Africa with kind of a mixed audience. Those
                    people that wanted to see greater US involvement and engagement in Southern
                    Africa welcomed the study. But there was another group who felt that the study
                    represented the cutting edge of an international corporate conspiracy to come
                    and exploit Southern Africa's mineral resources, and that they had to be
                    cautious of real US intentions. It wasn't until later in the 1980's that the
                    Reagan Administration made the unfortunate decision to really up the ante by
                    assisting Savimbi, but I think there were already indications that the U.S. was
                    beginning to support some groups within Angola and Mozambique for another
                    agenda. That was not well received by the other Southern African countries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you remember anything about the state of the program
                        that we had?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: During the time of the study, we had our small programs in the BLS
                    countries. We had a program in Malawi and were trying to have a program in
                    Zambia, although the Zambians made it very difficult by constantly creating
                    policy conditions where it was tough to do anything. But we had nothing
                    virtually except for humanitarian programs in Angola and Mozambique, and nothing
                    in South Africa. During the time that this study was underway, or it might have
                    been a little bit later, yes, when the funds were voted for Zimbabwe, there was
                    a relief bill voted. There was an earmark put in that relief bill that we had to
                    spend at least five million dollars for relief inside Rhodesia, which would have
                    been a violation of US sanctions, or at least many people considered it so. I
                    remember that during this period we had a difficult issue with Senator Helms'
                    staff, who didn't want us assisting countries on the periphery of Rhodesia
                    without doing something for Rhodesia itself.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You finished up the study?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: We finished up the study in 1979 and at that time I was asked to take
                    over the Office of Development Planning in Washington in AID. I did that for
                    about a year and a half. It was not the most rewarding assignment for me. I much
                    preferred being in the field. The Development and Planning Office involved an
                    awful lot of budget work. We were constantly working out budget allocations,
                    program allocations, not only with the different missions, but negotiating these
                    with State, within the Bureau, within PPC, within other parts of AID. Then, of
                    course, the Congressional Presentations and all of the notices that had to be
                    made to Congress all went through this office.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No strategic initiatives that you were working on?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                <p>STACEY: We tried to work on a few strategic initiatives. The one that I do recall
                    at the time was one that there was a great deal of concern about the changing
                    situation in agricultural production and the possibility of a neo-Malthusian
                    rising population, declining food productivity and declining environmental
                    capacity on lands. We did put together a major presentation for the Congress and
                    other parts of the administration to really try to demonstrate that Africa
                    really wasn't feeding itself. Imports were increasing and we were always
                    influenced by fads and changing modes in this business of development. When I
                    started with AID, the focus was on institutional development. Not too many years
                    later it became basic human needs, after the ILO had published its famous study
                    on basic human needs. Then, of course, it became structural adjustment, and
                    every time we were in some mode that was perceived as trickle down, people would
                    want something different, so after structural adjustment became sustainable,
                    development came and so on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During this time though, or it was in the later phases, we
                        were in the New Directions mode. Do you know anything about that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: It was the end of the basic human needs period but it was the New
                    Directions mode. You better refresh my memory. It seemed like we always had new
                    directions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was a congressional initiative, after the Vietnam
                        affair in the mid 1970's, when support for foreign assistance waned. It
                        shifted the focus to direct assistance to the poor and the poor majority.
                        You were part of that effort to direct programs along that line.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: Yes, I do recall that. In a sense that grew out of the basic human needs
                    approach, but I agree with you. In a sense, this was all of the antibodies that
                    had built up to what people thought was trickle down.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We can come back to that. So you were there not too long
                        and then you moved on to Zimbabwe I believe?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                <p>STACEY: I had a short stint as Office Director of Southern Africa. I had the
                    opportunity to look at how to implement some of the things we had done in the
                    Southern Africa study a couple of years earlier. I had only been the Office
                    Director of Southern Africa for a relatively short period of time when the first
                    AID Director to Zimbabwe, Chuck Grader, decided to leave and accept an offer in
                    the private sector. I had been scheduled to go to Tunisia as a Director, but at
                    the last moment I was offered the opportunity to go to Zimbabwe. This was an
                    opportunity I certainly didn't want to pass up. From 1981-1986 I was in Harare,
                    as the Director of both the bilateral program which was committed by the U.S. at
                    Lancaster House, when the Rhodesian settlement was negotiated, and also the
                    initial program for SADCC (the Southern Africa Development Coordination
                    Conference).</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just a tangent here, do you think your study and the
                        reports that you did had any relationship to the formation of SADCC?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: Oh, yes; it contributed. I think SADCC would have been formed regardless
                    of whether the study was done or not. But because of the working relationship I
                    had established with the contact group, involving David Hood, the EC and the
                    Commonwealth Secretariat, we were able to get some of our ideas into the
                    briefing materials for the two presidents who really pushed SADCC.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We can come back to that in a minute. What month in the
                        year of 1981 was this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: You know, I really can't remember. I think it was early in 1981 and I was
                    there until 1986.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation in Zimbabwe when you arrived
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                <p>STACEY: The situation was really quite hopeful in that there were so many things
                    to work with in Zimbabwe. There was still a technically competent civil service;
                    you had a local currency that had some value that you could do things with. You
                    had a private sector that was functioning and an economy that was making
                    hundreds of small-scale industrial products. You had a sophisticated
                    agricultural sector, which had grown up around commercial farming that
                    technologically had something to offer the small farmers, this new set of
                    clients that were coming on strength. So there were a lot of positive things to
                    work with. There was a sense of can-do that came out of the Lancaster House
                    conference. The Zimbabweans organized a major meeting called ZIMCORD, which was
                    their first major meeting of coordination of donors. There was a lot of good
                    will towards Zimbabwe, to help them recover from the war, help them rebuild and
                    get their agriculture going again. Everyone was reasonably confident of success
                    except for one thing. Nobody knew how Socialist or Marxist the policies of these
                    former guerillas really were, because when they were in the bush fighting they
                    said some pretty strong things along Socialist lines. I do recall Chedzaro, at
                    the first ZIMCORD conference saying something that has...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was the Minister?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: Yes, he was the Minister of Economy and Finance and had spent most of the
                    war outside of the country. He was the Deputy Secretary General of UNCTAD, so he
                    a pretty good indoctrination into Western thinking and nobody thought that he
                    was a Marxist like some of the other leaders of ZANU and ZAPU. I remember him at
                    the ZIMCORD conference saying something that I remembered a long time. He said
                    “Growth without equity is unacceptable, but equity without growth is disaster.”
                    It was his way of trying to reassure the donors that the country was not going
                    to pursue a policy of redistributing productive assets. If anything, in terms of
                    the politics of redistribution, what the government focused on was trying to
                    redistribute opportunity.</p>
                <p>They did that through massive expansion of education, a modest program of land
                    resettlement based on purchase of land on a “willing seller-willing buyer”
                    basis. They changed some of the labor laws to try to give people a more
                    stability in their employment. It certainly, aside from the modest land purchase
                    program, it wasn't a redistribution kind of strategy at all.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So what was your task?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: I was the Director. We had seventy-five million dollars a year, which had
                    been promised at Lancaster House.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And a pledge at the ZIMCORD meeting, I believe.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                <p>STACEY: And a pledge at the ZIMCORD meeting. Fortunately, because we were in a
                    reconstruction period, we had very flexible authorities on how we could use
                    these funds. There was an interest in terms of the senior management of AID, to
                    really implement this program with a very small mission. The idea, which I
                    completely agreed with, was to see what we could do with a very small bilateral
                    mission, which was running the regional program as well. We had seven
                    direct-hire staff total, including for the SADCC Program. We got the necessary
                    support from Washington with the kind of authorities we needed to approve
                    projects in the field. One of the chief elements of the strategy at that time
                    was to give support to the Zimbabwe private sector, which was really starved for
                    foreign exchange. They had been living under very difficult import restrictions
                    for a long time. They were awash in liquidity of local currency. The idea was to
                    use our dollars to sop up the excess foreign currency of the private sector,
                    letting them have access to foreign exchange. We, in turn, then would use the
                    local currency for reconstruction, seed packs, rebuilding schools and bridges.
                    We did the first land mine clearance program that I know of, that AID ever did
                    in Zimbabwe in 1982-83. We had to do it in a rather...it took a little bit of
                    creative styling of this project to do it legally.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the main sectors or concerns?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: Aside from this significant commodity import program, because the country
                    had been starved for many years for any imports, the farmers needed tractors,
                    all kinds of industry needed raw materials. Aside from that, the major areas
                    that we focused in and where I think we really made some contributions, was a
                    major population program. There was a significant demand and a very strong group
                    of women who were able to get through a major program. As a result, I think
                    Zimbabwe's contraceptive prevalence rate has now gone over fifty percent. It's
                    considered the outstanding family planning program in Africa now.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you trying to do with the program then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: The program had been largely run by private hands. It didn't have a lot
                    of legitimacy in the new political leadership. What we had to do is to get the
                    political blessings of the new leadership and basically transform it to
                    one—because that was the best we were going to get from a private family
                    planning organization— that had the right kind of support and hands-off
                    philosophy from government. It was fortuitous timing that one of the women who
                    was a key actor in this organization was the twin sister of Mrs. Mugabe. Both of
                    them were from Ghana originally and they had a background in this field. So
                    between Mrs. Mugabe and her sister, we got the political support we needed. The
                    program was difficult because we were under in the period of the AID
                    administration in 1981,when we were being pushed very hard to use only natural
                    family planning methods by the then USAID/Africa Bureau Assistant Administrator
                    at the time - Mr. Frank Ruddy.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Assistant administrator.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: Assistant administrator for Africa. The Zimbabweans wanted a full range
                    of services, including Depo-Provera, which was an injectable at that time, which
                    had not been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, but it had been
                    approved by the WHO. It had been used in Zimbabwe and had many social advantages
                    for women. They wanted to continue with Depo-Provera and at that time it was
                    against U.S. policy to finance the use of it, and even to finance organizations
                    that were using it. So we had some difficult and awkward political issues with
                    the headquarters on this program before we finally got it approved but it
                    certainly is pulled off.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We were the primary supporter of the program?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: Yes, we were the primary supporter of the program, and later on the World
                    Bank and other donors came in, but this was clearly a program that we took the
                    lead on and took a lot on heat on early on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you have any information on how it got started? How the
                        interest in family planning began?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: There were various people who claimed credit for getting this interest. I
                    decided that many of the women in Zimbabwe had become quite empowered during the
                    war. They played an enormously important role in the fighting. They had
                    political access after the war and this was right at the top of the women's
                    agenda. It wasn't small business products or agricultural farm implements. It
                    wasn't a change in the gender laws. It was family planning. They wanted to
                    reduce family size and better education for their kids. That was the number one
                    priority.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the other sectors?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: Another major sector that was enormously challenging was education. Since
                    the government's policy was to expand educational opportunity, they went from
                    eight hundred thousand children in school, to over two million, in less than two
                    years. They more than doubled the number of kids in school.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was our role?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0068" n="Page0068"/>
                <p>STACEY: Our role was to try to keep them from collapsing under this influence. We
                    had a major educational planning model that we had been creating in the Ministry
                    of Education, with US technical assistance, through the AED - Academy for
                    Educational Development. So we helped with a lot of the planning, and perhaps
                    one of the most significant things we did was we built a teacher training
                    college, entirely out of local currency. This project was exceptionally
                    interesting, in that since it was funded with local currency, we didn't have the
                    same review and approval process to go through, had we been constructing this
                    institution with US dollar funds. So a lot of the contractor selection,
                    architectural work and building were done by the Zimbabweans, which we signed
                    off on. To make a long story short, they built this college on an old airstrip
                    that had been used before as part of their sanctions busting effort during the
                    Rhodesian war. We transformed this old airfield into a fully functioning teacher
                    college in fourteen months.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did the staff come from?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: The staff had been trained and put in place at another institution,
                    during the time that the college was being built. So that when the physical
                    construction was finished, they could transfer the staff right over from this
                    other institution.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These were all Zimbabwean staff?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: Mostly Zimbabwean, some were white Zimbabweans. It was a teacher training
                    institute where all of the teachers who were going out to teach had to be able
                    to teach not only science, English and math, but also they had to be able to
                    teach one of three technical skills - either carpentry, electricity or
                    agriculture. So they had a whole practical dimension to the curriculum.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the curriculum developed by our people?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0069" n="Page0069"/>
                <p>STACEY: We had some input into the curriculum through the contract with AED.
                    Later we helped them on distance learning. But our strategy was generally built
                    around employment. We said: “Look, we have to reduce the number of new entrants
                    coming into the labor force. We have to improve the quality of those entrants
                    coming into the labor force, in terms of the education they're getting. We have
                    to get greater productivity out of the agricultural sector, so that more off
                    firm employment could be created in the rural areas.” In that regard, we
                    invested in a series of marketing depots, again using local currency. Every
                    farmer in the country had a marketing depot within fifty kilometers of his farm.
                    At these marketing depots, they could bring in cotton, maize, a variety of
                    produce, have it weighed, purchased and he could receive his check when he went
                    out the door. He could also buy new seeds, fertilizers and other farm implements
                    at the same time. So it was kind of a one-stop shop, in these farming depots,
                    but the Agricultural Marketing Authority made sure that the farmers received
                    their check on the spot. One of the keys to the small amount of agricultural
                    success we saw after independence was not just that they had the technology of
                    improved seeds and other things that had been developed by commercial farmers,
                    but they had these marketing depots and they knew they were going to get paid
                    immediately. When they got paid immediately, their incentive to produce was
                    nailed down and they got a fair price.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We also had a major role in the agricultural sector,
                        didn't we, in this program?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: We had a major role in helping reintroduce seed packs and farm implements
                    and imports that were absolutely essential to get agriculture reborn again.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We had a local currency program there too?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: Yes, we had a large local currency program there for the ag center. We
                    also financed three cotton gins. Cotton was the fastest growing crop among small
                    holders, a cash crop. They grew the cotton in rotation with maize and it would
                    be a major impediment if they couldn't get new ginning capacity. There was a
                    very strong preference for American gins, so we had to make the case that the
                    Zimbabwean cotton didn't compete with American cotton, in order to finance these
                    cotton gins under the Commodity Import Program. This resulted in a significant
                    expansion of cotton production.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we involved in any of the overall planning and
                        strategy for the agricultural sector?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0070" n="Page0070"/>
                <p>STACEY: Yes, we worked with the Ministry, but we could only go so far with really
                    influencing their strategies. We worked very closely with the British. We did
                    help them with studies which tried to show them that land resettlement was not
                    the answer for the population pressure in the so called “communal lands” — lands
                    that had been occupied more by the traditional African farmers. They had thought
                    prior to independence that by redistributing the land they could solve this
                    problem, but it was impossible.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did we have any agricultural institutions that we were
                        supporting?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: Yes, the agricultural faculty at the university was a major program. We
                    not only reinforced their Bachelors Degree program, we helped them create a
                    Masters program in agriculture - probably the best Masters program on the
                    continent in agriculture. That was done through a contract with Michigan State
                    University. We had Carl Eicher there as one of the leaders in the program. We
                    bought a farm for the University. This farm supports itself, or the sale of the
                    produce supports the farm. It was very close to the University, so the students
                    could come out on the weekend to have practical classes in irrigation, poultry,
                    beekeeping, dairy production, because it was a completely integrated farm.
                    Again, we bought that out of local currency, with the government's
                    concurrence.</p>
                <p>We did some innovative food triangulars there as well. There were some serious
                    maize deficits in both Malawi and Mozambique, largely as a result of the war
                    that was continuing to wage over there. Large numbers of refugees were moving
                    into Malawi. Zimbabwe had maize surpluses, so we were able to convince the USDA
                    to ship wheat to Zimbabwe, which they normally imported, and Zimbabwe then
                    shipped their surplus maize to Malawi and Mozambique. This was good in the sense
                    that it helped facilitate regional commercial trade in food grants. It also
                    recognized the fact that we were not competitive in exporting maize to this
                    region, but since these countries couldn't produce adequate wheat, we were
                    competitive.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the transport sector? Were you working on that
                        as well?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0071" n="Page0071"/>
                <p>STACEY: Through the Commodity Import Program, eighty percent of the commodity
                    imports was reserved for the private sector, and twenty percent was reserved for
                    the public sector. Through the public sector parts of it, we did support
                    transport. We financed GE locomotives for the railroads. That was at the top end
                    of the spectrum. At the lower end of the spectrum, we were using local currency
                    to repair bridges, repair roads, things that were damaged during the war. We
                    also imported some D8 caterpillars for the Ministry of Rural Roads, for rural
                    road repair and maintenance, but that was a bit of a subterfuge because the
                    government had a very difficult land mine clearance program ahead of it. The
                    kinds of mines that had been planted in Zimbabwe were these plastic
                    anti-personnel mines, which often didn't kill people as much as maim them for
                    life. What they wanted was D8 caterpillars with three inch steel reinforcing at
                    the bottom, and then they would just run over the mines and blow them up. So we
                    put that kind of specification into the procurement documents for the D8
                    caterpillars, and then we just didn't notice when the Ministry for Rural Roads
                    lent the caterpillars to the Ministry of Defense for land mine clearance. And
                    when we did notice, we asked them to return them and they did, but it was a few
                    years later, after a lot of mines had been cleared.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Not a loss of our tractors in the process?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: Not a one.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I had the impression that in all of these programs you're
                        talking about that you were having a fairly innovative program strategy,
                        programming arrangement and so on. What were you doing there that was so
                        different from the typical AID program?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: AID had allowed us to do sector programs before sector programs really
                    existed, as we know sector investment programs now. They had given us
                    considerable authority to approve these projects in the field and considerable
                    authority in the programming of the local currencies and the approval of local
                    currency projects in the field. Some of this authority was concurrent with REDSO
                    in Nairobi, helping us out, because we were committed to keeping a small mission
                    so there were certain specialties that REDSO had: contracting officer, engineer,
                    and so on. The fact that they would let us...for example, for an ag sector
                    program, finance a lot of those activities with a commodity import program. So
                    we were doing an ag sector program with a commodity import program element that
                    went beyond the agriculture sector, but we were applying the local currency to
                    agriculture. What we were trying to do on one hand was keep the private sector
                    alive in Zimbabwe until more stable times prevailed, but make sure that this
                    local currency, which we could do a lot of things with, was being applied in a
                    strategic way to priorities we agreed on with the Zimbabwe government. Since
                    most of these local currencies were country-owned, we had to work very carefully
                    with them.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0072" n="Page0072"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find working with the Zimbabwean
                        government?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: There were some terrific people we worked with in the government who were
                    highly trained, very clear thinking. People like Bernard Chedzaro, who was the
                    Minister of Finance and Economic Development; Dennis Norman, who was the
                    Minister of Agriculture, a white Zimbabwean; Robbie Buwuzi, who was the
                    permanent secretary to the Minister of Agriculture. They were really excellent
                    to work with. We had very frank sometimes a little bit fractious relationships.
                    There was always a great deal of resentment on the part of the Prime Minister,
                    President Mugabe, whenever there were conditions on any kind of aid. As far as
                    he was concerned there were no conditions that were put up at Lancaster House
                    when the seventy-five million dollars was promised.</p>
                <p>There was a time when some of his military, the so-called Fifth Brigade, were
                    really abusing civilians in Matabeleland. A lot of human rights organizations
                    including Amnesty International, were quite concerned about these human rights
                    violations, so we did suspend the program at one time. At least the ag sector
                    program, until some of these practices stopped. That created a rather tense
                    period with the Zimbabweans. This was in 1984. One program I forgot to mention
                    that we did which was quite successful was a housing program as well - Housing
                    Investment Guarantee (HIG). You had sufficient number of people in urban areas
                    with salaried employment that HIG could pay for itself. There was a large unmet
                    demand for low cost housing. The building societies, which did lend for housing
                    did not lend to that low-income strata. Thus, they would lend to medium income
                    people for housing. What we did was we used our HIG in a way that got the
                    building societies to lower their thresholds for lending, something in the range
                    of two to three thousand dollars, so that they were reaching a different end of
                    the market—lower income people. We started several housing programs there. The
                    properties were bought and the loan repayments were quite good. As far as I
                    know, these programs have succeeded.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: On this question of working with the Zimbabweans in this
                        capacity, how do you compare that capacity with the Sahelian countries and
                        whether this was a factor in what you were able to do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: There was no comparison. The kinds of people you had in various
                    government offices in 1981-82 were very high.</p>

                    suspect that there's less capacity now than there was in '81-'82. You've had a
                    lot of people who have left government and some of the people that they
                    attracted back to government from overseas after the was ended; they didn't stay
                    too long. They found that working in government was in some cases difficult. In
                    other cases, they weren't paid as well as they could be in the private sector.
                    Even the university, where we had really built up an excellent ag faculty after
                    South Africa became independent, they began recruiting black professors from
                    neighboring countries and quite a number of Zimbabweans went down to South
                    Africa. So they were lost to Zimbabwe.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But you did see some brain drain into South Africa at some
                        point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: Oh, yes. Out of Zambia and Malawi as well. Out of all of the English
                    speaking countries there's been a brain drain. Not a brain drain to the region,
                    but it's been a brain drain from Zimbabwe. Again, the salaries and conditions
                    that they were working under were not ideal. The government, in some cases, put
                    a lot of restrictions on university professors as to what they could do and say
                    and so on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about your relationship with the embassy? Were they
                        trying to steer you in various directions?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: We had a good relationship with the embassy. We had a series of
                    ambassadors who were well informed. They saw AID as a strategic part of what we
                    were trying to do there, and yet they had enough good sense to let us get on
                    with the job and do what we were doing. Ambassador Bob Keeley, was the first
                    ambassador. He was later succeeded by David Miller, who had come up from
                    Tanzania. The staff always appreciated Ambassador Miller. He would come over
                    once a week to the AID office, have coffee with us, kick off his shoes and sort
                    of ask us what was going on, what was it he needed to know, what kind of
                    problems were we having that he could help us with. So we always appreciated the
                    weekly visit from the ambassador.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Anything else on the Zimbabwe program?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0074" n="Page0074"/>
                <p>STACEY: We also had a rather novel situation in that I was not only the Director
                    for the Zimbabwe Bilateral Program, but for SADCC as well. We set the initial
                    parameters in that period for the U.S. regional program with SADCC. We began
                    getting into Mozambique and into transportation in the SADCC program. During the
                    period of the seventies, we had been very much in the New Directions mode of
                    basic human needs, and we were not doing very much with infrastructure. I had
                    the rather unusual situation in Zimbabwe where all of the seventy-five million
                    dollars was Economic Support Funds (ESF), so I didn't have the same earmarks and
                    restrictions that we had on the AID account. I was doing everything from
                    railroads to population with ESF money. We always had to convince the State
                    people that this was a good strategic use of ESF money, and that under this set
                    of circumstances you didn't just want to write the government a check. In fact,
                    we were spending the money twice: the first time through the private sector, and
                    the second time through the local currency accounts. The fact that we could
                    really get back into transport again with Zimbabwe being land locked, Botswana
                    being land locked. Some of your potentially higher performing countries there
                    were highly dependent on either Mozambique or South Africa for their egress. I
                    think we really broke the ice there of getting back into major
                    infrastructure.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your mission was to get involved in the infrastructure
                        transport area with SADCC?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: When SADCC was formed, different countries were charged with taking the
                    lead on a particular sector, and Mozambique was the lead country for
                    transportation planning in all of Southern Africa. It was so important to the
                    future of the region - to agriculture, to exports, to growth, to poverty
                    strategies, to employment creation - you just couldn't walk away from transport.
                    Because it had been severely disrupted during the war, these countries had a lot
                    of things they needed to import, they had things they could export, but you had
                    to work with Mozambique. The problem we had in those days was that the
                    government of Mozambique was not very pro-American. We were still working out
                    our relationships with the government, which a lot of people in Washington
                    considered to be Marxist. It was really in the mid-eighties that we began to
                    work that out. That's where the SADCC programming in Mozambique really helped to
                    pave the way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you involved with the initiative for transport under
                        SADCC?</hi>

                <pb facs="0075" n="Page0075"/>
                <p>STACEY: I was very much involved with the planning of the Beira corridor. There
                    was a lot of opposition in Congress to getting involved in the Beira corridor
                    because Zimbabwe had troops down there. The only pipeline, which provided fuel
                    to Zimbabwe came up through the Beira Corridor, and it had been blown up a few
                    times by some guerillas, so Zimbabwe sent their troops across the border which
                    they thought was in their own self interest. A lot of members of Congress didn't
                    like that and they didn't particularly want us getting into Beira corridor
                    transport project, which was aimed at rehabilitating the Port of Beira and the
                    railway going down there when in fact Zimbabwe had a military operation
                    underway. So we had to work through those issues.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you work with SADCC as an institution? What was that
                        phenomena?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: We worked with SADCC as an institution. SADCC had it's Regional Executive
                    Secretary in Botswana. Our program with them wasn't just transport. We also, for
                    instance, got into a major ag research program with them in sorghum and millet
                    with ICRISAT as the implementing agency. We also began working with them on
                    livestock possibilities, since two countries down there had EC quotas for fresh
                    meat exports. It was thought that perhaps other countries could participate in
                    that.</p>
                <p>The SADCC program was hurt by two things at the end of my stay in Zimbabwe that
                    probably should be noted. On the SADCC side, the decision was made by the Reagan
                    Administration to increase the assistance to Savimbi. It was ironic that Savimbi
                    was visiting the White House on the very day that SADCC was having its
                    ministerial meeting in Harare. The lead minister for SADCC, who happened to be
                    the Vice President of Botswana, Peter Mmusi, got up and read a resolution from
                    the ministers condemning the U.S. regretting that on this day they were meeting
                    that Mr. Savimbi had been invited into the White House, and been given
                    assistance that they thought was counterproductive to the interests of the
                    region. When this motion was read out from the floor of the meeting, the head of
                    the U.S. delegation, who was the Assistant Administrator for Africa, Mark
                    Edelman, instructed all of us to get up and walk out in protest, including the
                    Zimbabwe Director. We all did, and that created a rather difficult working
                    environment with SADCC for some time afterwards, as long as the U.S. was
                    involved with Savimbi.</p>
                <pb facs="0076" n="Page0076"/>
                <p>The thing that happened on the bilateral side, which came with terrible timing,
                    was that Zimbabwe was elected in 1985 to the Security Council for the UN as one
                    of the three Africa seats. I think it was in '85 or '84, I can't remember. It
                    was just before the South Korean airliner was shot down by the Russians as it
                    crossed over near Japan. As you'll recall, there were a series of efforts to
                    condemn the Soviet Union, including a resolution in the Security Council.
                    Despite all kinds of lobbying efforts by the United States, including George
                    Schultz personally, the Zimbabweans decided to abstain rather than to vote in
                    favor of the U.S. resolution. That abstention was taken as a real slap in the
                    face to US interests. Our seventy-five million dollar per year program was
                    dramatically cut right after that. We were in the last year of our commitment to
                    the Lancaster House. We received a very substantial cut in our obligation
                    authority as a result of that one abstention. A vote history will little
                    remember nor long record.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And this was long before President Carter fiasco, which
                        cut off the aid all together later on.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: That's right. Later on was when President Carter had to walk out of a
                    meeting and that was the end of it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you meet with President Mugabe?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: Yes, I met with him a few times. He was a very insular type of man. You
                    always got the impression that he was not listening very carefully. I do recall
                    one discussion with him on the merits of capitalism versus socialism. He said
                    that for him, he recognized the ability of capitalism to create wealth, no
                    question about it. But for him the danger of capitalism was individualism: that
                    the kind of individualism that our capitalist system spawned created a predatory
                    individual. This was a threat to the family and society, this kind of
                    individualism. So he said he wasn't afraid of capitalism, he was afraid of
                    individualism. I do remember another discussion with him. This goes back to
                    earlier days in the late seventies when Henry Kissinger discovered Rhodesia, and
                    was going around the world making speeches about mobilizing billions of dollars
                    to settle the Rhodesia question. During the time that I was there, Henry
                    Kissinger came through, this time as a private citizen. There was a meeting with
                    Mr. Mugabe and the American ambassador. At the meeting, Mugabe asked Mr.
                    Kissinger where all these billions were that he had been talking about.
                    Kissinger answered with almost a straight face. He said” Oh, Mr. President, the
                    billions are out there. All you have to do is borrow them. Nobody will make you
                    pay them back.” That said a lot about the view of third world debt that Mr.
                    Kissinger held.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Anything more on SADCC and the Zimbabwe experience?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0077" n="Page0077"/>
                <p>STACEY: That is perhaps the highlights of the time. I do know that while we were
                    convinced we were doing good projects and that many of these projects would
                    stand up to the test of time, and from what I know many of them have, such as
                    the Teacher Training College, and the agricultural faculty at the university,
                    and the Marketing Depots. They're all still functioning. But we had a little
                    impact on overall policy. We had an impact on population policy; we had an
                    impact on housing policy. We had a limited impact on agricultural pricing
                    policy. But overall in terms of the macro policies, I think we were in a
                    situation where there was a risk. We see it today with the declining value of
                    the Zimbabwe currency, rising budget deficits, the fact that there was never a
                    peace dividend. In other words, the ending of the Rhodesian War never resulted
                    in any reduction in military spending. The government still kept increasing its
                    military spending. All of these factors meant that the optimum results possible
                    from the kind of AID investment program we were making, we weren't getting; that
                    was the real dilemma. We really were doing some good projects, but we weren't
                    sure they would stand the test of time, because of the macro-economic policy and
                    because in those days they really didn't want to have a great deal to do with
                    the World Bank, either. We had a situation where we and the British were doing
                    as well as anyone anywhere with policy dialogue with the Zimbabweans, because
                    they were rather impervious to outside policy advice in those days.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's move on to your next assignment. You were finishing
                        up in Zimbabwe and what happened then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: Since I'd had my entire career in Africa, and since I had an interest in
                    Asia as well - I'd started back in India - I basically decided that maybe I
                    should look for my next tour somewhere outside of Africa. About that time I got
                    a call from Assistant Secretary of State Chester Crocker, who was quite tied up
                    in those days with very difficult situations in Angola and South Africa, who
                    wanted a senior AID person as one of his deputies, to handle all of the economic
                    and AID matters. I got a call from him and he asked if I would be interested,
                    provided that he could get my nomination past the White House, because they
                    didn't like too many liberals coming into the administration.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was during the Reagan administration?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: This was during the Reagan administration. I'd always been an independent
                    voter, but my leanings had always been left of center. I don't think I'd voted
                    for Mr. Reagan. So I got a call back about a month or so later. I got the
                    support of the ambassador there who was a political appointee, David Miller. I
                    got a call back saying there were no liberal odors, which was the term that the
                    assistant secretary used. So I took the job and came back to Washington in 1986,
                    which was right in the middle of the Reagan administration.</p>

                </p>
                <p>STACEY: There were three deputies: one that handled political affairs, one that
                    handled military affairs, all in coordination with the Pentagon and the
                    intelligence agencies, and one which handled all economic and aid matters. I was
                    one of the deputies.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were Deputy Assistant Secretary? That was your

                </p>
                <p>STACEY: Yes, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State in the Africa Region. It was a
                    very good assignment. We had early morning political briefings at about seven
                    thirty, with the Assistant Secretary. Following the Intelligence Briefings, we
                    would have a small staff meeting of all the deputies with the Assistant
                    Secretary. We'd go over major issues for the day, what needed to be brought to
                    the Secretary's attention. I always did the briefings on anything that had to do
                    with aid, with our relations with AID, budget allocations; country levels; any
                    kind of political issues; anything dealing with the World Bank or any kinds of
                    major programs that were going off track in terms of the IMF or the World Bank;
                    severe debt problems in terms of countries that would no longer be eligible.
                    There was a whole range of things that I had to cover in this position.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have staff?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: My direct staff was just a secretary, but I basically supervised the EPS
                    office, which was the Economic Policy Office of the Africa Region. I also
                    supervised the regional office, so I had about twenty evaluations to write of
                    State officers, many of them who had already served as ambassadors. It was kind
                    of difficult.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A fairly senior group then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: A fairly senior group, and they didn't like AID people coming over into
                    such senior positions. They didn't think we had necessarily earned our stripes.
                    We hadn't passed the same tests. I think I was at least on the personal side,
                    very rewarded, because I seemed to have very good relations with all of the
                    State people. I really never felt like a second class citizen or anything like
                    that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the issues that you were concerned with. Let's
                        take them one by one, the things you were trying to do and the issues you
                        had to face.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0079" n="Page0079"/>
                <p>STACEY: One of the more difficult issues at the time, and you will recall this
                    because you were involved as well, is that we were really beginning an AID
                    program in apartheid South Africa. The issues of how apartheid would end and in
                    what role was still not clear at all. There was enormous pressure from the
                    Congress and interest groups for sanctions on South Africa, something the White
                    House and the administration were resisting. And yet it was expected that the
                    aid program there would, without violating everyone's desire to put pressures
                    and sanctions on the government, help build linkages with the majority community
                    and future leaders. This was an extremely delicate political issue. It was
                    expected that I would provide a lot of oversight on what AID was doing and not
                    doing. The embassy in South Africa, the ambassador then was Herb Nichol, wanted
                    to keep the AID program on a very short leash and restrict their activities
                    quite severely. On the other hand, in order to be effective in what they were
                    supposed to do, the AID people needed this kind of liberty to go out and build
                    relationships and bridges with these future leaders. Some of the people that
                    were assigned to the South Africa program in those days, the AID people, were
                    really doing that, but there was a constant amount of objections coming back
                    from the embassy wanting us to really get tough with the AID people. All of that
                    fell on my desk.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a lot of staff then, in South Africa?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: There was a small staff in South Africa. I can't remember if Tim Bork was
                    heading up the office at that time. Carlos Pascal, who's now with the National
                    Security Council was out there at that time, as an AID officer, with his wife. I
                    think it was a small staff, two or three people, but most of the program was
                    being managed by locals, by South Africans, because there were some very capable
                    people down there. I don't remember the exact content of the program that well
                    at this time, but I know that for instance we were very involved with financing
                    the defense of the Delmas Six, which were a group of accused South African
                    terrorists who...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was a human rights program?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: This was part of a human rights program, and the Delmas Six were a very
                    well known group of ANC people who had been apparently caught planning
                    activities or undertaking activities. They deserved a fair trial and we helped
                    support that. They were eventually found not guilty and were freed. I think two
                    of them are ministers today for the South African government, which shows you
                    the kinds of people that AID was working with.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We were financing their defense?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0080" n="Page0080"/>
                <p>STACEY: We were financing their defense plus a lot of support of their families,
                    because these peoples families were almost destitute, and in some cases they
                    were having difficulty keeping a roof over their head and keeping from becoming
                    homeless, so AID was doing some really very important work and yet it was a very
                    sensitive time. To some groups we were breaking sanctions or working against
                    sanctions. To other groups we weren't doing enough. We should have been
                    supporting something more revolutionary. Despite all the difficulties, I think
                    that was one of AID's finer hours, because they really did do some goods
                    things.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there other projects that you remember getting
                        involved in? Others were not so controversial.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0081" n="Page0081"/>
                <p>STACEY: There were a couple that were particularly important. You'll recall at
                    the time that the Congress was in the process of passing a sanction on South
                    Africa. Very strong lobbying from groups like Trans Africa and other
                    African-American groups. The administration's policy was “constructive
                    engagement”, a term we hear once again now in 1998. But it was a term that
                    really got people rather inflamed, even in Southern Africa. Many groups, even in
                    the countries I had previously worked with, in Zimbabwe and Mozambique, felt
                    that there should be no engagement with this regime. At the same time, they were
                    all trading with South Africa out of economic survival. Anyway, there was
                    concern that we had to do something other than just stave off sanctions. I was
                    able to convince Crocker, and he was able to convince Secretary of State
                    Schultz, that doing something much more positive and more visible for the
                    countries on South Africa's periphery who were suffering because of sanctions
                    and were likely to suffer more if sanctions were added. So they asked me to work
                    on a major program of five hundred million dollars over three years. Some people
                    wanted to stretch it out over five years, but we conceived it as a three-year
                    program. It focused on transportation, and a number of other key areas: air
                    transport, rail transport and road transport, to permit the periphery countries
                    of South Africa to continue to get their exports out, their imports in during
                    what could have been a protracted period of sanctions against South Africa,
                    because all of the European countries were increasing their sanctions as well.
                    One of the focal points of this program as well was the “Beira Corridor” which
                    was the key to the Zimbabwe's survival. The Beira Corridor contained their oil
                    and fuel pipeline from Beira up to Zimbabwe to the capital Harare. It also was
                    one of the key lines for importing the various things that they needed and
                    getting their tobacco out, which was the prime foreign exchange area. This whole
                    line at the time was under a guerilla attack from a group known an RENAMO, which
                    was a rather shadowy group, at least in 1985, that people knew very little
                    about. It had its origins from some of South Africa's activities in helping
                    organize such groups against the governments who were providing assistance to
                    ANC or the PAC. In this case RENAMO was severely disrupting the Beira Corridor.
                    Zimbabwe had sent troops into Mozambique to protect their interests. There was
                    really kind of a mess. As we conceived this program for the Beira Corridor, we
                    had to undertake certain consultations with members of Congress. There was a lot
                    of opposition at the time from some key Republicans. This was difficult because
                    I was working in a Republican administration. Key members really felt that we
                    should be supporting RENAMO and that the government of Mozambique...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Senator Helms and that group?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: Yes, it was Senator Helms, Congressman Burton, Senator Mitch McConnell -
                    especially McConnell from Kentucky. Some of them really felt that we should be
                    working against the government in Mozambique. You'll recall at the time there
                    was something called the Reagan Doctrine, which had underpinned, at least
                    philosophically, the support for the Contras in Latin America, for the
                    Mujaheddin in Afghanistan. Some of the members on the right on the Hill felt
                    that the same should support RENAMO in Mozambique—these were anti-Communist
                    fighters and that we should be assisting them.</p>
                <pb facs="0082" n="Page0082"/>
                <p>This became a major issue for Crocker. He was absolutely convinced, as was
                    Secretary Schultz, that RENAMO could not be compared to Savimbi. They had
                    incidentally opposed the aid to Savimbi, but had lost that battle. They felt
                    that it was going to come back to haunt us as we now know in 1998, because we
                    see that Savimbi is not a Democrat. But at least in terms of RENAMO, they felt
                    that this group had no political program. Their tactics were, from what we knew
                    of them, abhorrent. They were practicing very severe violations of human rights.
                    So there was a strong resistance. We would not even see their representatives,
                    although they had representatives here in Washington who had set up their
                    offices in the Heritage Foundation. So the difficulty with this program,
                    although it made a lot of economic sense, is that there were people on the Hill
                    who were opposed to it. The program never really saw the light of day, because
                    after the Senate and the Congress, as a whole, had passed the sanctions
                    legislation, President Reagan decided to veto it. This was not the
                    recommendation of Secretary Schultz and Assistant Secretary Crocker. What had
                    been recommended to President Reagan was a series of executive orders sanctions
                    that would have ratcheted up the pressure on South Africa and the announcement
                    of this positive program for the periphery countries to help strengthen their
                    resolve and actually helped them survive in what we thought was going to be a
                    period of protracted ratcheting up of sanctions, both from ourselves and the
                    European Union, as well as other countries. This program never saw the light of
                    day because the President decided to veto it. He gave a speech, which was really
                    inflammatory to all of the anti-apartheid groups. The speech, we found out
                    later, had been written by Patrick Buchanan, who was then in the White House in
                    the Communications Office. He is a current Presidential candidate now as we
                    speak in 1999. That speech really assured that the veto was overridden. What we
                    had happen was that the sanctions legislation came into effect, and this
                    positive program we had dreamt up for the periphery died. There was some
                    increase later on for SADCC activities, but the program as we had actually
                    worked it out, was just whipped into the archives.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were talking about this five hundred million dollar
                        program but that may have been an extension of what had been started when
                        you were in Zimbabwe?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: That's right. In 1982-'83 approximately, there had been a program, which
                    AID was supporting for SADCC, and I recall we had asked for about a hundred
                    million dollars. I don't know if that was over two years or three years, but it
                    was primarily on transport and for locomotives, which they needed. There was
                    also a program for agriculture. What we did later in 1986 was in many ways an
                    extension of that, but they wanted to give it more of a political spin. We were
                    going to hit South Africa with this stick with some sanctions, but we had all
                    these carrots for all the countries on the periphery. They wanted to package
                    this in a political way. I do recall that Peter McPherson, who was then the AID
                    administrator, and I traveled rather quietly through Southern Africa consulting
                    with the countries. So I think that the program with SADCC, although State when
                    I was there, we tried to put some political packaging on it. It was AID's
                    determination that the program went ahead later.</p>
                <pb facs="0083" n="Page0083"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Anything else on that particular program that Reagan shot
                        down?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: No, not on that. At the time the White House also decided that they
                    wanted to undertake some African initiatives. It seems like every White House
                    that comes along wants to undertake Africa initiatives. The first that the
                    Reagan White House wanted to do was on African debt. It wasn't so much that they
                    wanted to forgive it, as they wanted to understand the problem better. So they
                    formed an interdepartmental group on African debt, in which I was the State
                    representative. We were able, at that time, to improve some of the terms that
                    were being offered at the Paris Club. This group really did begin the debate
                    that you really had to do something about the stock of debt. That just doing
                    things on terms of debt was not going to get you anywhere. We were just rolling
                    a larger and larger snowball uphill.</p>
                <p>In addition, the White House said that the President also wanted to do something
                    on African hunger. I think the origins of this was a call from one of his old
                    actor friends, a woman in Hollywood, who had seen something on television and
                    called him up and said “Ron, we really have to do something about African
                    hunger.” So a task force was put together. We spent quite a bit of time, all the
                    various people on this task force from the White House, people from AID, people
                    from State, to create an initiative that would show that Africa mattered. Of
                    course, nobody today can remember this initiative or what happened to it, but
                    there was a ceremony to announce this and there were slick little publications
                    put out on what the U.S. was going to do about African hunger. I fear that when
                    the history of development is written, it's going to be a cemetery of
                    initiatives of this kind that each administration comes along and wants to take.
                    So that was the Africa food initiative.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the content of it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: The content of it was largely to increase funding for agricultural
                    research, a lot of that through US universities. To support, more
                    comprehensively, the CGIAR system, more PL480, Food for Peace, especially soft
                    term loans for US surpluses - not necessarily the best developmental tool, but
                    to feed people. There was also some other kind of lending that was going to be
                    available for fertilizers and other kinds of agricultural inputs. Most of this
                    program had been dreamt up in the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and I must say
                    the AID people didn't have much of an impact on the program. Had they, it would
                    have been more interesting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, what other initiatives were you occupied with?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0084" n="Page0084"/>
                <p>STACEY: I also chaired an interdepartmental group on refugees, emergency and food
                    aid. We had ongoing emergencies in quite a number of countries, especially in
                    Ethiopia in the North where there was a war raging. Groups inside those
                    countries that we couldn't reach any other way, except to bring food aid into
                    Sudan, which was a very sensitive issue, because we didn't have the approval of
                    the Sudanese government to do that. So we had managed very quietly and almost
                    secretively, this trans border food aid program. The key groups that we were
                    working with were NGOs that were set up by the Tigr� and the Ethiopians. We were
                    not supposed to assist these groups. We did not recognize them. The official
                    position was they were as Marxist as was the government in Ethiopia. The idea
                    was how to work very quietly with their relief organizations to try to make sure
                    that this food was not supporting the war effort or going to their guerilla
                    fighters. That it really was getting to the people who needed it. We had
                    confirmation of the need. But this became a difficult program to manage, and
                    eventually it was abandoned because it didn't have the kinds of controls on the
                    food distribution that one would normally have to have.</p>
                <p>The other thing that I managed which was also very difficult politically was this
                    task force that I chaired, which also had responsibilities for refugees. There
                    was an extraordinary outflow of refugees from Mozambique at this time, into
                    Malawi, into Zimbabwe, into Zambia, into Tanzania, into Swaziland and into South
                    Africa.</p>
                <pb facs="0085" n="Page0085"/>
                <p>The most serious refugee flow was into Malawi. People wanted to know why these
                    people were coming out in such numbers. It almost reminded one of Kosovo today.
                    What was the cause of this extraordinary flight? We were asked to undertake an
                    evaluation of this, and we hired Robert Gersony, someone who was well known in
                    the international community because he had helped to uncover the killing fields
                    of Cambodia earlier. Bob Gersony went out and he spent weeks traveling all over
                    to refugee camps. He interviewed over four hundred refugees on an average of
                    three to four hours for each refugee. He took extensive notes on what the
                    refugees were saying, because he was really trying to find out a great deal of
                    information and he had a very well developed questionnaire. All of his notes and
                    his questionnaires he kept secret. No one has ever really seen these except I
                    did. He showed them to me at one point. What he discovered was an extraordinary
                    pattern, because the refugees that were in Tanzania, Malawi and Zimbabwe etc.
                    were all talking about a very similar pattern of what had happened to them. So
                    Bob Gersony's report, when he wrote it up in draft, was politically very
                    explosive. It showed RENAMO had a very organized pattern of slave labor camps,
                    of terrible atrocities in the way that they recruited young people to their
                    ranks; of how they would kill their own parents before their very eyes. This was
                    all systematic and it was coming at a time when RENAMO was trying to get
                    political recognition in Washington. They had ambitions to have the Reagan
                    Doctrine apply to them and to receive assistance as Mr. Savimbi had. So when the
                    report, which I had to manage through the bureaucracy... it was a real political
                    hot potato. The first briefing we did was of US Secretary Schultz, who gave us a
                    full hour as I recall. He listened intently to the briefing and at the end of it
                    said, “This report should be published.” There were parts of the U.S.
                    establishment, especially some of the U.S. intelligence agencies, who had
                    concluded that RENAMO was going to win this conflict, and that we ought to
                    support the winner. And as I indicated earlier, other right wing groups who felt
                    RENAMO as an anti-Marxist, ought to be supported. There was great concern that
                    we would not be able to publish the report unless we had some support of other
                    key actors, and so Secretary Schultz called the then Secretary of Defense,
                    Robert Carlucci, and said, “I want you to meet privately with a couple of
                    people.” So we went over to the Pentagon and we met with Mr. Carlucci. The only
                    other person present at the meeting was the Deputy Secretary of Defense Taft,
                    the husband of Julia Taft, who had been with AID. We presented what was
                    happening and both of them again gave us a great listen and literally heard what
                    we said, and they said, “This report should be published.” So it was published.
                    It was very well received in Southern Africa.</p>

                <p>STACEY: Publicly available. The Gersony Report of Refugees - I forget the exact
                    title, but my name doesn't appear on it. Appropriately, Mr. Gersony's does
                    because he really worked hard under very difficult conditions, where he was
                    sleeping at night, out there to get all of these refugee interviews. It killed
                    RENAMO politically in Washington. They basically shut up their office and a
                    number of their political supporters in the Congress came out with statements
                    saying that they would no longer support them. We really never heard anything
                    further from other proponents about assisting RENAMO. Later on, Ambassador
                    Melissa Wells, who was Ambassador in Mozambique, helped get the government and
                    RENAMO talking. Ultimately there was a negotiated settlement. She said that had
                    the Gersony report not been published, she probably couldn't have established
                    the U.S. or herself as a neutral broker. In other words, it was the publishing
                    of this report that gave her the credibility with the government that the U.S.
                    was a neutral broker. The government was very convinced that the U.S. was either
                    planning to or already assisting RENAMO. So this report was very important, she
                    said. That was my small contribution to policy at that time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: From then on in it was more into the peace negotiation
                        between RENAMO and the government, but you were not involved in that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: No, I was not involved in that because in 1988 when I had fifty years of
                    service with my Air Force time...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Didn't you go to Mozambique at some point during
                        that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: Yes, I went to Mozambique for a major conference on the food crisis,
                    because the U.S. was providing a great deal of food aid at that time, there was
                    so many people to feed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Food crisis in Mozambique or in the region?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: Both, because we had internal refugees as well as people outside the
                    country. So there was a major meeting of donors there on food aid, but we had
                    published the Gersony Report a couple of weeks before hand. So at the speech I
                    made at the conference, we called a lot of attention to this report. It was the
                    only time in all of my public service that when I made a statement in a donor
                    meeting, I got a standing ovation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you say?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0087" n="Page0087"/>
                <p>STACEY: We pointed out the results of this survey, and really condemned the
                    terrible practices of RENAMO. While there were some human rights violations on
                    the part of Frelimo on the other side, the preponderance of the evidence was
                    that these refugees were fleeing in great numbers because of a terribly
                    organized and systematic exploitation and enslavement of these people. I called
                    it the worst holocaust against ordinary human beings since World War II, in the
                    speech. It was something that was widely appreciated by the Southern African
                    countries, by the donors, because they really thought the U.S. had come down in
                    the right way and done the right thing. We did get calls. I got a call from the
                    Assistant Secretary right after the speech saying that he had been receiving
                    some calls from various groups saying why did I have to use the word holocaust?
                    From the perspective from where I was sitting, and certainly from the
                    perspective of the villagers who were living under this terrible system, that's
                    exactly what it was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any other operations you were involved in? You
                        had to testify on the Hill I assume from time to time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: Yes, I had to testify a number of times on the Hill, and I'm glad you
                    asked me about that. Chet Crocker was, I think, one of the most interesting
                    people I ever worked with. He's the only Assistant Secretary that I can remember
                    during my career in Africa that really saw development as an integral part of
                    our foreign policy. He was very positive about AID and development. What he
                    wasn't positive about was the U.S. Congress. He considered many members of the
                    U.S. Congress not worth wasting his time with.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was a hard position to be in.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: It was a hard position to be in, and so his idea of his job was to really
                    be in the field as much as he could, working with the key actors. Of course, he
                    was trying to get the Cubans out of Angola and find a settlement to the Libya
                    problem, which many people credit him with. We solved the Libya program but
                    certainly created a new one in Angola, or certainly fueled it and perpetuated
                    it. Nonetheless, he didn't want to go out and testify. He would much rather go
                    out and negotiate. So he was always sending his deputies out to testify. I got
                    quite a bit of Congressional testimony.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your experience with Congress? Was it essentially
                        hostile?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0088" n="Page0088"/>
                <p>STACEY: A lot of the testimony was before the Africa Subcommittee of the House,
                    which at that time was chaired by Howard Wolpe, as I recall. He had on his
                    committee some rather flamboyant people. On the right I remember you had
                    Congressman Burton, but you also had Congressman Bob Dornan from California -
                    the one they always called B-1 Bob, because he was always supporting the B-1
                    bomber. They were particularly hostile to just about everything that was
                    development or anything we were doing in Africa. I do recall testifying several
                    times before the Leland subcommittee. Mickey Leland had a subcommittee on food
                    and hunger.</p>
                <p>One particular testimony with Mickey Leland I remember was when he really started
                    raising the land mine issue. This was in 1987, long before people like Princess
                    Diana and other politicians had discovered what land mines were doing. But
                    Congressman Leland was particularly incensed and concerned that we might be
                    providing land mines, which was denied by the administration, but that we
                    weren't speaking out on this issue - that children were losing limbs and it was
                    a terrible, terrible thing. It was innocent people who were suffering by land
                    mines. Since we had been involved in the land mine clearance in Zimbabwe, rather
                    quietly as I had mentioned, it was something I could really relate to with the
                    Congressman, so after a testimony he invited me back to his office and we had a
                    long talk about the land mine issue. He said he had a feeling that I didn't
                    share the administration's positions on land mines, since I had to state what
                    the position of the administration was, which was these were very much needed in
                    defense of the country and so on. I always thought that had Mickey Leland not
                    died in that terrible plane crash in Ethiopia, that this issue of land mines and
                    what it is doing to populations of Africa and other parts of the world would
                    have been on the international agenda much earlier.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about on the Senate side?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: I don't think the Senate had an Africa subcommittee in those years. I'm
                    trying to remember if I did do any Senate testimony. As I recall, most of the
                    testimony was on the House, and there were a couple of times before the
                    appropriation committees, on the AID budget. I would go up jointly with one of
                    the AID deputy assistant administrators.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about your relations with AID? You were an AID person
                        in State or a State person in AID. How did you find that worked?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: I found that curiously I was more accepted by the State people than I was
                    by the AID people. I think a lot of the AID people saw me as a little bit of the
                    enemy at that point. We had to really fight AID on some of the country
                    allocations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: On aid levels?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0089" n="Page0089"/>
                <p>STACEY: On aid levels, and as much as I wanted to cut some of these programs like
                    Kenya and so on, State had it's politics. I was the point person on this. The
                    Assistant Secretary told me that he didn't want to have to resolve the budget
                    issues with Administrator McPherson or anyone else. He said: I want you guys to
                    solve this. That's your job.” So we felt it was our job to solve these country
                    allocation budget issues.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find these aid levels politically
                        significant?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: What we found is that we were always fighting a bit of a losing battle.
                    As I recall, the year before I came into the Deputy Assistant Secretary job, we
                    had lost sixty-five million dollars of our obligation authority from that year
                    to Latin America. So the big problem was how to even protect the Africa levels
                    that you would start off with. It was difficult enough to arrive at levels, but
                    then during the course of the year, we were being asked to take these hits, like
                    “we need ten million of your budget.” Where we would take those from became very
                    painful and also acrimonious in negotiations with the AID people. We realized
                    that somehow we had to get an Africa earmark. As much as people didn't like the
                    word “earmark” and nobody wanted to hear about it, that was when we started
                    working on the Africa Development Fund, in 1986. We had to have some way to
                    protect the African money and stop these other regions from raiding it. In the
                    politics of things, Africa was always second fiddle.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you involved in the origins of the Development Fund
                        for Africa?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: Yes, we worked very closely with AID people and people in State, so I do
                    recall that as something we were involved in.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you remember anything about what the strategy and
                        concept was behind it, apart from protecting money?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: Yes, I do recall the areas of emphasis and so on. I think it was
                    something where everyone who worked on that deserved a lot of credit. It was one
                    of those things that had a hundred fathers. It later enlightened the rest of the
                    AID budget. The current legislation then had a lot of its basis in the Africa
                    Development Fund.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about working with the embassies in Africa and working
                        with the ambassadors? You must have been involved in some of these AID
                        issues with them?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0090" n="Page0090"/>
                <p>STACEY: Yes, they were always difficult. In general, I would say that the State
                    Department people did not understand what AID was doing and why we were doing
                    it, and how we were doing it. There were always problems with communication. It
                    was pretty tiresome to hear the AID people kind of denigrated, which
                    occasionally happened from these visiting ambassadors. There were some who were
                    really deeply appreciative of the program. We had a number of AID directors who
                    got on the wrong side of their ambassadors and were asked to leave the country.
                    So I always met with new AID mission directors before they were going overseas
                    and we'd talk about AID/State relationships. I'd always tell them, “Look, some
                    of these guys are a real pain in the backside, but you have to work with them
                    and make them happy. You have to keep them informed and if you get at cross
                    purposes with them, it's a no win situation.”</p>

                </p>
                <p>STACEY: Yes, there were a couple of regional meetings with...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Any particular issues you recall?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: You know, I really can't... This is one of the things that you remember
                    something and I don't! What I really do remember about the ambassadors is that
                    they had such a short term. I had my fifty years, given my Air Force, and I had
                    some family issues I had to deal with. I also felt that Foreign Service was a
                    younger person's job. I really felt one of the important things about Foreign
                    Service was to get the old fuddy-duddy's out and get the younger people in.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You weren't really much of a fuddy-duddy at fifty.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: I felt like if I was going to do other things, it's better to start them
                    at fifty rather than waiting around till sixty.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: I retired for about a year, and after that I had the opportunity to come
                    back to the World Bank and do some work with Kim Jaycox, who was then the Vice
                    President of the Africa Region at the World Bank, and who wanted to start an
                    Africa capacity building initiative. He began to put together a group to think
                    about how to address some capacity issues, and so I worked with him as a Senior
                    Advisor for about a year and a half and helped to start the Africa Capacity
                    Building Foundation which is now in Harare and Zimbabwe.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0091" n="Page0091"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the concept behind the foundation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: The concept behind the foundation is that Africa had been in structural
                    adjustment now for approximately seven years. One of the criticisms, and
                    rightfully so, was that so many of the macro economic and fiscal policy issues
                    were really being managed by the Bank and by various managers who were being put
                    in place, either through the project units that were being put into the field,
                    or through the supervision teams that were going out. This was a dead end
                    street. Africans had to find ways to build capacities for Africa, to manage
                    their own economies. There were a number of foundations, including Rockefeller
                    and Carnegie, who agreed to participate in the working group on these issues.
                    There was also this council of African economic advisors that the Bank had put
                    together, which was some twenty eminent Africans, many of them former ministers,
                    and so on. So they were also a source of discussion and ideas. There was a great
                    deal of discussion in these groups about how to approach this. Some people
                    wanted a broader capacity building initiative. You might be building capacity in
                    environment, or in taking on the university issue, because there had been a
                    decline in African universities in capacity. But Mr. Jaycox was very vigorous in
                    saying “No, this has to be focused on economic policy management capacity.”
                    Ultimately this led to the creation with a hundred million dollars that it was
                    put together. The Bank put fifteen million into it and other donors put more
                    into it. The Africa Capacity Building Foundation is based in Harare, with a
                    board provided from the international donors who contributed. I think the first
                    American board member on the ACBF was Elliot Berg, who has just left the board.
                    There's a second person now who has joined the board. They have been financing
                    projects, but at this point I can't really evaluate whether this foundation is
                    going to be successful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You haven't had any word on what kind of projects they've
                        been financing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: They've been financing various in-service or on the job training programs
                    for central banks, for ministries of finance. Not long term scholarships but
                    things that are very much improvement of internal systems and modernization of
                    how they deal with data. The focus has been largely on training and research. In
                    talking to Elliot Berg, he has questioned the quality of projects that have been
                    approved. It really seems like a drop in the ocean in terms of capacity needs.
                    Given the capacity that's needed at all levels - local levels in all kinds of
                    sectors- whether it's population, environment, the very narrow focus of this
                    needs to be complemented by other capacity building initiatives. I hope that
                    foundations of this kind catch on in Africa, because there are a lot of wealthy
                    African entrepreneurs. I recall John D. Rockefeller saying that the best
                    investment he ever made was in the Rockefeller Foundation. I hope that Africa
                    can begin to build up its own foundations and some of these wealthy and
                    successful African businessmen will look back and think that these foundations
                    that they might have supported were some of the best investments that they could
                    have made. We're kind of on the threshold of that possibility right now.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Interesting. Well, you did that for a year and a half.
                        What did you do after that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: The World Bank published in 1989 the famous long term perspective study
                    on Africa. When I say famous I mean that it generated a lot of interest and
                    stirred up a lot of activity. One of the conclusions of that report was that
                    Africa needed to be much better known to the external world. It needed to really
                    begin to build a coalition of international support for Africa, but, at the same
                    time, it needed a place where Africans could talk much more frankly with the
                    outside world. There was no consensus on many of the issues, and we needed a
                    place where we could talk about this consensus in much more honest ways. What
                    was proposed was the Global Coalition for Africa. The Dutch in 1989 hosted a
                    ministerial level meeting; there were a lot of Heads of State there as well to
                    examine this study of the bank. One of the outcomes of that meeting was the
                    proposal to establish the Global Coalition for Africa. The three co-chairmen,
                    Jan Pronk, who was the Dutch minister of development in the Ministry of Foreign
                    Affairs; Robert McNamara, the former US Secretary of Defense and President of
                    the World Bank; and Quett Masire, who is the President of Botswana. They had
                    agreed to be the three co-Presidents of this Global Coalition for Africa. So
                    here was something that the whole world had agreed on. We had three
                    co-presidents and we had no operating instructions, no program of work or
                    structure. Kim Jaycox asked me if I would work with the African who was going to
                    be the first Executive Secretary. There was an agreement that there would be a
                    secretary attached to the World Bank but not part of the World Bank. So Kim
                    Jaycox asked me if I would be willing to go over and help get this started. At
                    the time he wanted me to help manage the SPA Program, the Special Program for
                    Africa, which was funding the support for Africa's structural adjustment. In the
                    meantime, since the person who was managing that, Phil Birnbaum, one of our
                    former colleagues, was not yet ready to retire but was getting close. The idea
                    was that I would go over and work on getting the Global Coalition started and
                    then come back over to SPA. So I worked with the first Executive Secretary of
                    the GCA. He had come there from ECOWAS, where he had been the Executive
                    Secretary of ECOWAS in Lagos. He and I were a two person secretariat and we sat
                    down and started working on how this would operate. We wanted something
                    informal. A lot of the operational process that the GCA now utilizes was drawn
                    from the Club du Sahel, because everyone wanted something informal and that's
                    the way the Club had been, so we agreed to use that as a bit of a case study.
                    Finally we had our first political meeting of the GCA, which was held in France,
                    hosted by the French and the Ministry of Development. We presented all of the
                    operational documents and the first year's work program and so on. It was
                    approved and everyone pledged enough money to get the Secretariat going.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who attended this meeting?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: It was attended by all of the major donors in Africa. As I said, most of
                    them were heads of agencies or ministers. I'm trying to recall who came from
                    AID.</p>
                <pb facs="0093" n="Page0093"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: On the African side?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: There were a number of African ministers and a few heads of state;
                    President Masire chaired the meeting. Everyone wanted a GCA that would be
                    African led. That's why they had an African head of the Executive Secretary.
                    There were some who were not happy about the attachment to the World Bank. They
                    felt that maybe the GCA Secretariat should be somewhere in Africa. The counter
                    argument was, “That's politically correct, but that's not necessarily the place
                    where the Secretariat can be most effective, in terms of lobbying for Africa,
                    access to information, in terms of being present in the major places where you
                    want the Secretariat present. Either France or Washington was the best place. By
                    having an attachment to the Bank, this group could also keep an eye on the Bank.
                    They could be Africa's insight into the Bank if the African's would use it
                    properly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the main function of this group?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: The main function of this group as I said, was to first of all admit that
                    there were all kinds of areas, in terms of Africa's development and economic
                    issues where we did not have a consensus.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Such as?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0094" n="Page0094"/>
                <p>STACEY: Such as the issue of what we call the nexus between population growth,
                    agriculture and environment. Many people were approaching these as single
                    issues. Some people thought Africa was doing okay on agriculture. Others thought
                    it was an environmental disaster. A lot of people felt their population growth
                    was much too high. There were others who felt Africa didn't have enough
                    population density to stimulate its markets. So despite the fact that we were
                    all doing projects and programs, because that's what you had to do to get the
                    money, there wasn't a consensus on the real policy issues, especially how they
                    interacted across sectors. So the idea was to admit that, and then have the
                    kinds of exchanges on these issues as we could. The GCA started off with three
                    subcommittees in which we assembled people, again using some of the contacts
                    that the three co-Presidents had, to really bring people in at policy level. The
                    three subcommittees were one on economic policy, one on democracy governance and
                    human rights, and one on regional integration. The one on economic policy was
                    chaired by Kwesi Botchway, who was then the Minister of Finance and Economy in
                    Ghana. The one on governance and human rights was co-chaired by President Soglo
                    of Benin and President Masire of Botswana. The one on regional integration was
                    to be chaired by the President of Senegal. Unfortunately we started off badly on
                    the third subcommittee. The first meeting we had was with all these regional
                    organizations - the SADCC, ECOWAS, etc. The agenda, which had been written up,
                    because we wanted to plunge right into the issue, was Rationalizing Africa's
                    Regional Institutions. All those regional secretariats arrived thinking they
                    were fully rational. How dare we, as a group of outsiders, come in and suggest
                    that all this was an irrational pattern of institutions. Eventually this
                    subcommittee was abandoned. We then began to operate with just the two
                    committees, and began to deal with regional integration under the Economic
                    Policy committee. The other chairmen were active.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you do with population and demographics? What was
                        the process?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: The process was not to launch programs, but to try to move from the
                    absence of consensus to some general consensus on how to proceed, and then to
                    bring into the room all of these people from their respective countries and
                    agencies, you talk honestly about the issues; you try to agree on how you should
                    proceed. For instance on population, that we not take too narrow a focus. This
                    is not just about reducing the growth rates. We took a much more comprehensive
                    view of this. Then you assume that everyone is going to go back to his
                    respective countries or agencies and put these recommendations into practice.
                    Six months or a year later you have a meeting and just basically say, “Are you
                    people doing it this way?” In other words, you were trying to validate
                    politically specific approaches, but then the assumption was that people would
                    go back and carry these out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did it work?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0095" n="Page0095"/>
                <p>STACEY: I think it's too early to tell. It's only been a few years now. The GCA
                    is pretty strongly supported by the people who go to their meetings, and if
                    nothing else there's an appreciation for the ability to...because in GCA
                    meetings you're not allowed to make speeches. If you come with a pre-prepared
                    speech from your capital, they ask you to submit it for the record. The meetings
                    are organized in such a way as to force ministers and heads of state to abandon
                    their briefing notes and talk from what they really feel inside. Because donors
                    and even the African ministers go to so many places where everything is so
                    formal, they appreciate the candor of these kinds of meetings. Now a critic
                    would say that it's only a talk shop and you're not really changing policy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But you did reach a consensus?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: Yes, there was a consensus that was reached on how to approach some of
                    these issues, but again, you reach a consensus for instance on the idea that we
                    have far too many projects. So therefore, we have to move to programs. Everyone
                    can agree on that, but you can't agree on how to change some of their own
                    funding procedures and in some cases, things that are legislated.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did they deal with donor procedures and things of that
                        sort?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: We dealt with donor procedures in the context of how do donors more
                    effectively finance their interests in democracy and governance. How do donors
                    more effectively support adjustment and policy change? You don't do it by having
                    two hundred and thirty-seven conditions in a loan. These issues of
                    conditionality and so on were discussed very thoroughly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you think these had any impact on the donors and the
                        Bank?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: In a sense, the Bank became a good listener in these meetings and
                    committed itself to improve the nature of the support programs for adjustment.
                    Some of the evolution was towards the sector investment programs now have come
                    from some of these discussions. On the other hand, the Africans realize more now
                    the importance of spending on social sectors. I've never seen such frank
                    discussions on military spending, for instance, and what the appropriate level
                    of military spending is for a country. These are the kinds of things that the
                    Bank really couldn't discuss too heatedly with the governments, because they're
                    member governments of the Bank. But under the GCA umbrella, things like the
                    level of military spending could be brought up. The GCA gave the bank a little
                    bit of an umbrella to talk about things that they couldn't talk about in their
                    normal lending capacity.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were any UN agencies involved in this?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0096" n="Page0096"/>
                <p>STACEY: Yes, the UNDP Administrator was always there, and we had a very active
                    participation from the head of UNFPA - I forget her name, a Pakistani woman. The
                    head of UNICEF was there also.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were these reports published?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: Yes, they published reports. We also instituted an annual report on
                    Africa, which took about thirty-five key indicators which we tried to focus on.
                    This annual report now is a great source of a very authentic view of what Africa
                    is all about. We hope that the GCA report will begin to have the same kind of
                    audience that the UN Human Development Report does. It's much briefer and much
                    more readable, in that it only focuses on about thirty-five key indicators.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Have they changed the agenda of subjects or are they still
                        just economic and population based?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: It's economic and then democracy and human rights, so that the population
                    issues, agriculture issues and regional integration issues are all subsumed
                    under the economic committee.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Right.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: It's a kind of entity that works if everybody gets engaged in it. In
                    other words, if the Africans invest their leadership in it; if the donors invest
                    their time in it, and a little bit of money, it can be useful for Africa. But if
                    they don't and just expect that the Secretariat is going to deliver some sort of
                    revolution for Africa, then it won't work. The only thing that the GCA is, and
                    this is very much like the Club du Sahel, it's a gathering place where people
                    come together. If they come together and really put their shoulders to the wheel
                    because they want to do some things and they want to learn from each other, you
                    can accomplish something.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did it have any promotional dissemination where they took
                        the issues and consensus and then tried to spread the word through sub group
                        meetings within the African and donor communities?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: Yes, they organized for instance with the Japanese. They have two major
                    conferences in Japan on African Development and these were jointly organized
                    with the GCA Secretariat and the Japanese. You could see that there was a good
                    opportunity to provide information and insight to Japan and some of the Asian
                    countries.</p>

                <p>STACEY: Within Africa, less so. We did have a couple of major meetings in Uganda
                    and South Africa and also in Benin, but if you asked the African on the street,
                    “ What's the Global Coalition to you and what's it done for you?” they wouldn't
                    know. It's very much something that would be more known in Europe or in
                    Washington and New York than in Africa.</p>

                <p>STACEY: That's really about all right now. I was possibly going to stay with the
                    Bank but at that time I was contacted by the Club du Sahel to see if I would
                    consider coming back to direct the Club, which also had to go through a time of
                    restructuring and getting itself re-mandated. We had talked about that
                    earlier.</p>

                    three years, then they asked me to stay for a couple of more.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That pretty well covers it. You'll have an opportunity to
                        flesh out some of those subjects. That's quite a history and great story.
                        Let's turn to some general observations. We can take them one at a time, but
                        if there are any other areas that we haven't touched on that you want to
                        bring out in general, fine. Maybe you'd like to start off with some of your
                        own general observations on your experience. One of my first questions would
                        be: given this tremendous experience you've had over the years in the world
                        of foreign assistance and development, are there any universal lessons that
                        come to mind in the practice of foreign assistance or in it's role in
                        development that would be useful for people to understand what works and
                        what doesn't work? I know that's a big question, but maybe there are two or
                        three or four things that you've already referred to that we might put into
                        a sum up here.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: I have an awful lot of thoughts and I feel I've already touched on many
                    of them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which of them stand out in your mind?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: One of the things that stands out in my mind is how enthusiastic we were.
                    How misunderstood we were in some ways, about what we were doing.</p>
                <pb facs="0098" n="Page0098"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In AID?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: In AID. I must say, whether it was from the Congress or colleagues in
                    State, it always seemed like we were really battling on all sides to try to
                    prove that we really had something to offer. In terms of the best of what this
                    country is about, AID was certainly undervalued and underappreciated in terms of
                    policy. I remember one of my professors saying that foreign policy is basically
                    composed of two elements. There is the moral element, which is our values and
                    how we project those values overseas, and then there's national interest. When
                    the two conflict, it's always the national interests that prevails. I always
                    felt like we had such a difficult row to hoe to present the moral and the best
                    of our values, which is what AID was supposed to be about. Then to complicate
                    things further, we were always the victims of fadism. Rather than building
                    systematically on our experience and our knowledge base, we devaluated ourselves
                    and as we accumulated new knowledge, we were always the victims of these new
                    fads. It seemed like every new administration that came in either had a program
                    of reorganization or a program of new directions. As I look back, we were
                    constantly adjusting to the new directions and new fads, and when you look back
                    you discover that nothing is really new.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel that all these fads were basically any
                        different from the days when you started?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: No, they were nothing new and often they were dangerous because some of
                    these fads were fueled by special interests or by single-issue kinds of
                    people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Like what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: Like population, for instance, was an issue we constantly wrestled with.
                    We know now, for instance, that urbanization is good for reduced family size.
                    Urbanization gives women a more rapid access to education and literacy. But we
                    never promoted urbanization. On the contrary, we were trying to do all kinds of
                    rural development projects to keep people down on the farm. So we weren't
                    looking at these issues in comprehensive and dynamic ways. We wanted to approach
                    population from the standpoint of getting information and birth control methods
                    and so on — meeting this demand that was there for birth control and not really
                    appreciating how important family size was to the survival of many of these
                    people, where the number of units of labor you could put on the family farm in a
                    given year might be whether you make it or you don't make it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What does this reflect though? What's lacking? Why do we
                        have this dilemma?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0099" n="Page0099"/>
                <p>STACEY: As I said, we were always the agency of the U.S. government that was, in
                    the eyes of everyone, that needed to be changed. Foreign aid was always
                    unpopular. So to say we were going to go in and reorganize foreign aid on the
                    basis of how we run businesses, as was said during a Republican administration,
                    suddenly we had these things that just had to be terribly efficient. No project
                    could run more than five years. That's not the way development works in these
                    countries. Many of the results that we were going to get, we knew, from our
                    experience. We knew this was going to come twenty or thirty years down the road
                    but we couldn't fight the fadism. All of this contributed to a less than
                    successful portfolio that we should have had, if we were able to build on the
                    experience and the learning we did as an agency. Rather than being able to
                    provide value-added to this accumulation of experience and learning, we were
                    constantly wrestling with the new fads that came in with each new
                    administration.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You talked about this experience and learning. Was there
                        anything that came to your mind as a key lesson of that experience that we
                        should be building on or have built on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: For instance, for me I think that it was demonstrated in a number of
                    instances in Southern Africa in 1971, 1973. It was demonstrated in the early
                    phases of the Sahel Program and then later in Zimbabwe that we could run very
                    substantial aid programs with very small overseas missions, and yet we didn't do
                    that. We allowed mission size to grow. A lot of this was driven by Washington's
                    need for more information, more planning, more evaluation. In other words, the
                    amount of information, processed-type information, missions were being required
                    to provide accounting and financial management. A lot of this was fueled by
                    Congress or the Inspector General's Office; they constantly wanted to tighten
                    down the financial management. So some of the flexible ways that allowed us to
                    run these programs with small missions were taken away from us. We never really
                    built on that experience that we had in the seventies. We never built on the
                    experience of working very closely with the embassies; in other words, having
                    one or two AID officers in the missions. There was an insistence on having
                    separate missions. Frankly, I think it was an error.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about what we learned about designing and developing
                        projects in African countries?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: We've learned that despite all our great ideas and despite all of our
                    very knowledgeable people in the project design and technical specialties, that
                    we had to be much better listeners to what our African partners were talking
                    about; what their problems really were. It's not so easy to do that, because
                    when these kinds of important finances are involved, you get a lot of mixed
                    signals. What I learned about designing projects is that in many cases we should
                    have taken a much smaller role to begin with, with a longer perspective without
                    putting too much money up front on some of these projects. Even saying what the
                    budget should be was a mistake. It distorted the possibilities for local
                    ownership right from the beginning.</p>
                <pb facs="0100" n="Page0100"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the whole area that's been a theme throughout
                        all of your work and others - the building of the African capacity. What
                        have we learned in that area?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: It's not that we don't know how to do capacity building because I've
                    watched what AID has done with universities and research institutions and so on
                    over the years. Capacity building in one country is very easily lost to a
                    neighboring country or somewhere else, as we saw when events changed in South
                    Africa. We've been far too forgiving of the technical assistance establishment
                    over the years. The demands that certain kinds of technical assistance or
                    management or support offices had to be in place because you just didn't have
                    the local people who could do this were exaggerated. We fell into the trap of
                    financing what really is a kind of industry - the industry of development. It's
                    probably a necessary industry. There are a lot of very good people out there.
                    But we put far more lip service into using African consultants for instance, and
                    really looking for competent Africans who could work on these projects than we
                    should have. We gave, in some cases, less credit to local capacity than we
                    should have. I always thought we should speak more of capacity enhancement than
                    capacity building, because there's enormous local knowledge out there that isn't
                    capitalized on. You don't have the value-added in many ways. I know that in the
                    Sahel, for instance, these people have the capacity to survive and extract a
                    living out of a very, very difficult ecology that I don't have the capacity to
                    do, even with all my degrees.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's interesting. Let's go back. You mentioned earlier
                        the two interests - the moral and the national interest conflict. Given that
                        you worked both in AID and in the State Department, do you find these
                        interests mutually supportive, or does one undermine the other? What has
                        been your experience? How do these two get along with each other?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: In a sense, it was always a false distinction. Some of the programs we
                    did in Zimbabwe with ESF funds — the seventy-five million dollars we had a year
                    with ESF funds—we used that to support everything from population, agriculture
                    and seed packs, all kinds of rural development. We funded the teacher education
                    college. These were being funded with so called security funds.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But why was it ESF?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: Because the seventy-five million dollars a year had been basically
                    justified as a political contribution to the Lancaster House Agreement, so
                    rather than take that kind of a hit into the money that was pledged on the DA
                    budget, they said it would be funded out of ESF. This was a time when it was
                    easier, frankly, to get ESF than it was Development Assistance. But what we used
                    it for was developmental. It had nothing to do with security.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you found the two quite compatible in that sense. Was
                        that always the case?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: That was not always the case, no.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there other instances where the political pressure
                        from the Ambassador or State Department undermined your development
                        effort?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: There were instances where ambassadors wanted to do different things with
                    the funds, but I can't remember, at least in my field missions, that ever
                    happening. What I found was that there was a lack of appreciation about why
                    development should be an integral part of our foreign policy and not something
                    that was apart, or something that was just our moralistic, do-good conscious
                    saving. No. It should be an integral part of our interest. What I find is today
                    there is more appreciation of that than there was twenty years ago. I've watched
                    how some of the most effective donors in the world operate, some of the Nordic
                    countries and the Dutch. Their aid establishment now is an integral part of
                    their Foreign Ministry. And yet they somehow seem to avoid having the short-term
                    political pressures of ambassadors. They seem to be able to operate with very
                    small overseas staff and I don't hear complaints for instance, from the NGO
                    communities in Europe that the presence of the aid function in the Foreign
                    Ministry is really compromising people development. The NGOs are still very
                    active. They get broad support from the Dutch ministry. They have a good working
                    relationship, but the Dutch aid establishment is part of the Foreign Ministry.
                    Despite all AID has done for me, I really think that by integrating the best of
                    the AID people in State, we really could bring about an integration of our
                    foreign policy and development interests in a much more coherent way. Let me
                    give you an example.</p>
                <p>Most of our ambassadors in the field have no brief whatsoever on the things that
                    they take up with the president of a country or the head of that country. No
                    brief whatsoever of a regional nature. It's almost all bilateral. So in terms of
                    Africa's regional integration, the development of markets, a lot of what we
                    would want to happen regionally by these countries doesn't necessarily need a
                    program or projects. You need to have a coherent plan that all of the
                    ambassadors in the West Africa region saying the same things. By bringing AID
                    into State, we could have a much more effective coherency in our trade, our
                    investment and our development policies. That's going to be the name of the game
                    in the future. Making sure that our trade policy is...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was going to ask how the development program supports or
                        has supported out national interest? Given that some of these things seem
                        kind of remote. They're good things but how do they serve our national
                        interest?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0102" n="Page0102"/>
                <p>STACEY: What's striking today as we speak in 1999 is the years and years that we
                    have all spent really projecting the best of the U.S., and yet how angry a lot
                    of the world is at us right now. The value of what AID has done over the years
                    is broadly unappreciated. It's so easy to condemn AID as being money wasted or
                    money “down a rat hole” as Senator Helms has said, and I can think of so many
                    instances where, had AID not been there, had the assistance not been provided,
                    we would have had very serious consequences. You can't prove that because the
                    fact that these consequences didn't happen, you don't have the proof of the
                    counterfactual of what would have happened, but I certainly believe that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That leads into my next question, which is this. Looking
                        back over your many years in foreign assistance and your work with AID, do
                        you think it has made a difference in the world?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: Yes, I certainly do. There were programs I never worked with when I first
                    came into the agency - programs with Korea and Taiwan and Turkey, countries that
                    are really developed countries today. Two of them are members of the OECD and
                    the DAC, but they were aid recipients when I came with AID. As I look at the
                    contributions all over Africa, they're visible to me. They're not as visible to
                    other people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What do you see?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: I see an agricultural transformation taking place in many parts of
                    Africa, that is drawing greatly on a lot of US provided technology that came
                    through a variety of research programs, universities, international research
                    institutes — all of that was funded from the AID budget over a long period of
                    time. As markets are changing now, as policy reform has made farming more
                    competitive, as Africans are able to capture their own markets, they're drawing
                    on a great deal of expertise, competence and management capacity that either
                    directly or indirectly has come from international aid and support.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Are there any other areas besides agriculture?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: Education. Not all African countries have progressed as well as some on
                    education, but those that have progressed have accomplished a hundred percent or
                    close to a hundred percent enrollment in terms of their primary and secondary
                    schools. A lot of that came from US support. Look at Botswana, Zimbabwe, Ghana,
                    the universities in Africa. Although they've gone through difficult times, they
                    still have continued to provide an output of people that are very important to
                    building capacity.</p>
                <pb facs="0103" n="Page0103"/>
                <p>If you ask me what was our single greatest contribution to capacity, I would say
                    some of the African universities. They're there all over the continent. As I
                    said, despite the fact that they've fallen on some hard times, many of these
                    faculties are still operating and many of them are improving in the last ten
                    years. So I think that's a second area. In terms of population, although it's
                    always been controversial both on the right and the left, AID has been very
                    courageous in supporting the availability of services because there was a
                    demand. The need was there; the demand was there. Despite being buffeted by all
                    kinds of politics with the population program, AID has been able to help many
                    countries provide services. In places like Zimbabwe where the contraceptive use
                    has gone over fifty percent now and family size is dropping. These programs are
                    probably the only delivery vehicle, albeit ineffective at this point, for
                    HIV/AIDS prevention and dissemination of information on HIV/AIDS. So some of the
                    infrastructure that we helped provide in the '70's and '80's with the beginnings
                    of these family planning programs, have been terribly important now in helping
                    with the delivery of HIV/AIDS related services. Infrastructure, people have
                    forgotten that we did a lot of infrastructure in Africa. We did railways; we did
                    dams and all kinds of primary and secondary roads. We got out of the
                    infrastructure business with some of the fads that came along like basic human
                    needs. It always seemed if you were doing basic human needs and people centered
                    development you shouldn't do transport, and yet the record would show that...
                    For example, the Canadians, who kept doing transport throughout the eighties,
                    really believed that probably the greatest impact they had on agriculture was
                    because they funded roads. I think it's unfortunate that we got out of
                    transportation, but during our career, during the sixties, seventies and early
                    eighties it was part of what we did. I think that in a way it was almost
                    unfortunate that we got into democracy as a major element of the AID business. I
                    know that could be controversial in some quarters.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you more concerned with that in the early days?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0104" n="Page0104"/>
                <p>STACEY: We didn't call it that. We called it “Popular Participation and
                    Development”. As we began to call it “Democracy” we began to excessively look
                    for democracy through the optics of multi-party elections and not all of the
                    other democratic things that were happening. We also understood poorly the
                    traditional elements of African democracy. The “kgotla” where everybody from a
                    district or a village would get out and sit under a tree and talk for days and
                    weeks, if necessary, in what really is a very horizontal discussion. It's not
                    vertical. It's not hierarchical, but very horizontal. Everybody has his say. And
                    eventually there's a consensus that happens. Sometimes people will talk way
                    around the issue. The issue may be a livestock head tax but people are talking
                    about somebody else's goats eating somebody else's grass. So Africans' sometimes
                    have very basic ways of approaching issues that are very democratic. Sometimes
                    we haven't looked for African democracy where it is, because I see it in this
                    explosion of newspapers and journalists, private radio, NGOs, and civil society
                    organizations. And yet multi-party democracies as we know them, are almost
                    always flawed. I've watched some countries, which are in some ways doing very
                    good things developmentally. They're even improving governance but they've taken
                    a couple of steps backward on multi-party elections. So they get bad marks on
                    democracy and we close up and yet they're progressing very positively on
                    improved governance. The way we approached democracy as a kind of litmus test as
                    to whether a country was developing or improving the lot of their people, we
                    have to look for democracy where it is and not just through multi-party
                    elections.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Good. Looking at Africa today, there are a lot of people
                        who are very negative or very skeptical about anything being accomplished
                        through the AID program, what do you say to the people who say, “The African
                        situation is hopeless. What have you done with all this assistance over the
                        years? It doesn't seem to be any better.” How do you respond to people along
                        that line?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0105" n="Page0105"/>
                <p>STACEY: First of all, the amount of assistance we have put in over the last
                    thirty years is a drop in the bucket compared to what others have put in and
                    what the Africans' themselves have put in. People don't realize how much effort
                    Africans' have put into the struggle themselves for their own development. While
                    the people of Africa merited better governments, the fact that they didn't have
                    them didn't prevent the people from struggling in their own ways for their
                    development. We underestimate the challenges that they have in terms of
                    geography, soils, climate and disease. I remember people used to talk about the
                    low productivity of African labor. My productivity would be pretty low too, if I
                    were carrying five diseases around in my body while I was trying to work in the
                    hot sun. Again, we have to better establish the counterfactual. Where would
                    Africa be today if the international community and the U.S. had not done what we
                    had? We did not do enough development. If our budgets had been larger, we might
                    have wasted more money. I don't know. You can't compare, for instance, Africa
                    and India. When India came to independence, the British left this enormous
                    system of schools systems - secondary schools, universities, medical and law
                    schools. They left railways and irrigation systems all over the place. The
                    British didn't leave anything like that in Africa. The French and the Portuguese
                    left even less. So what the Africans were building on was a much more difficult
                    task than say India or Asia, I would argue. The conventional wisdom on Africa is
                    that savings and investment rates are the lowest in the world. I don't believe
                    that. I see, all over Africa, enormous amounts of private savings going into
                    homes and urban businesses and kiosks, and their own children's education. You'd
                    be amazed at how much they put into their children's education from their own
                    savings. All of this doesn't get valued in the official data.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about African leadership? What we hear about Mobutu
                        and some of the others who have led some of these atrocities. How do you
                        measure African leadership?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: Some of the worst of African leaders we helped prolong their existence
                    for reasons of Cold War. That was clearly the case with Mobutu. But he wasn't
                    the only one. Others that we knew were not doing the best things for their
                    country. The new generation of African leadership that one sees now is much more
                    encouraging. You see this in a number of countries. I don't know that the
                    governance issues are all going to be corrected very quickly. The most difficult
                    question to answer is whether a lot of the good things we see on the ground will
                    continue to be really durable in any way if you have leaders who continue to rob
                    the countries and stimulate all sorts of illegal capital flight. I guess I've
                    always been too much of an optimist on Africa to think that's going to continue
                    forever. There are a number of countries where you see capital coming back now,
                    even though they had leadership that robbed the countries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And in the ethnic conflict area?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0106" n="Page0106"/>
                <p>STACEY: Again, I see ethnicity as the reason for African conflict. If you look at
                    the way people live and function, and the intermarriages between family and
                    tribal groups, you see that the conflicts are much more over either boundaries
                    that make no sense, because they were drawn by Europeans, or conflicts over
                    natural resources. As people's livelihoods are broken down, as old systems that
                    used to sustain people have changed — competition for productive land and
                    grazing areas... There was a major conflict in which a hundred people died in
                    Nigeria yesterday between two ethnic groups of herders and cultivators. The
                    conflict issue was land tenure, not ethnicity. Frequently, the international
                    press and others interpret these conflicts as ethnic conflicts. I would argue
                    that the major source of African conflict continues to be scarce resources like
                    water, pasturage, land. Also the borders that make no sense and the competition
                    for power that emanates from them. If people really saw, for instance, that
                    Sierra Leone's future was not as Sierra Leone with all of the trappings of
                    sovereignty and so on, but really as part of the United States of West Africa,
                    then maybe you wouldn't have so many people willing to fight and die over what
                    really are artificial boundaries. You could, in the same sense, look at the
                    future of Montenegro, Bosnia or Kosovo. Their future is part of the European
                    Union, not of Yugoslavia. I think we have to look beyond these manifestations of
                    sovereignty that are really anachronistic for Africa. I'm afraid that our aid
                    programs and all of the bilateral instruments we use in some ways add to that.
                    We've got to look beyond these boundaries and beyond these short-term natural
                    resource conflicts so people can begin to follow opportunities in the ways that
                    they have for centuries. The fact that the people from different ethnic groups
                    move across borders has always been accepted. It's only when we create
                    artificial borders and deify them with too much of all of the accouterments of
                    national sovereignty, that we complicate their lives and our own lives as AID
                    donors and in terms of the diplomacy that we want to play.</p>

                <p>STACEY: I can't think of anything else that I would rather have done. In terms of
                    the career choice that I made, it was wonderful. I always looked forward to
                    going to work in the morning. I was earning a living at what I really wanted to
                    do. I felt very fortunate. I could have been assembling Ford trucks or something
                    like that, but I was working at something I really wanted to do.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find AID as an agency to work for?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0107" n="Page0107"/>
                <p>STACEY: On the whole, I found AID a great agency to work for. I wish it didn't
                    have to go through all the painful deaths and rebirths that it always had to go
                    through. One always wanted to defend the agency because you felt you were under
                    attack from so many quarters. I remember Crocker saying to me, “Listen, when the
                    people on the right and the people on the left and the NGOs are all angry at
                    you, then you know you're on the right track.” So I kept telling myself that AID
                    was on the right track because we were getting hit from all sides. There's an
                    old proverb that says that “people only throw stones at trees that give fruit”
                    so I thought that was a pretty good proverb to bear in mind. This business was
                    something that I wouldn't have wanted to miss in terms of a career, so I'm glad
                    I did it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: With that proverb, which was a good one to close with,
                        this has been an excellent and fascinating interview and I thank you very
                        much.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STACEY: There was another great proverb I used to always bear in mind, especially
                    since we were always dealing with various donor coordination arrangements,
                    bringing people together and trying to find consensus, whether it was a Round
                    Table or a CG. The proverb is “Ten men digging, one man filling, lots of dust,
                    no hole.”</p>
