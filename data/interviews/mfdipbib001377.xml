                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is June 24th, 2003. This is an interview with Max M.
                        Kampelman. This is being done on behalf of the Association for Diplomatic
                        Studies and Training, and I'm Charles Stuart Kennedy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>To begin with, when are where were you born?</p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: I was born in New York on November 7, 1920; so I'm 82 years old.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you were born in the city?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: In the city.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you tell me a bit about your parents, first on your
                        father's side and then on your mother's side?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: Well, both of my parents came from a portion of Europe, which was then
                    considered a part of Romania, although it's gone through different transitions
                    over the years. They met here in the United States. Though they both came from
                    the same community they didn't know each other in Europe, but they met in the
                    United States. They married in New York. I was the only child.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was sort of the background of your family? It was a
                        Jewish family?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: A Jewish family.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is there a family trade or something like that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: I don't know as much as I would like to know and frequently criticize
                    myself for not asking more questions when I was younger. My mother's father was
                    relatively well to do and was involved in agriculture in Romania. I don't know
                    very much at all about my father's father. I knew my father's mother, my
                    grandmother, because she came over with her children to the United States - and
                    with her husband, but her husband died before I was born. She was a grand dame
                    and kept the family together, the brothers, and lived with one of my uncles,
                    always adjacent to us, so we were very close. So I grew up really in a kind of
                    intimate relationship with my father's family. My parents met actually at one of
                    the ethnic groups that were created in New York, where people from the same
                    European community, particularly among the Jews, would form their own burial
                    society.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. The burial society was a very important factor.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: There were not only burial societies, but there were places where one
                    could borrow money without interest and pay it back. It was a cooperative kind
                    of arrangement. And that's where they met.</p>
                <p>It was at the outset, by no means, a financially comfortable arrangement. We
                    lived in the Bronx in an area that was - I wouldn't call it a slum, but a
                    low-income area of the Bronx - and that's where I was born. My father was first
                    in the silk remnant business. This was before my time. When I began growing up,
                    he, for some reason, opened up a butcher shop; so he was a butcher and my mother
                    would work in the shop. Things got better after a while and through one of his
                    associates born in the same area he did some investing in real estate and
                    therefore until the Depression went up a little bit and we moved into better
                    homes - better apartments actually.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These were apartments then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: All apartments.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were they walk-up apartments?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: Walk-up apartments, yes.</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>When things turned bad again he left the butcher business and they decided -
                    because again, one of their friends was in the ladies' hat business, so they
                    opened up a retail establishment selling ladies hats, after the butcher shop
                    closed. My father died when he was fifty-four, a relatively young man, but by
                    then we were living in a relatively comfortable private home. But he left no
                    money really and we ended up living in what I would then call a slum. It was an
                    apartment in which my mother's sister was living. She was a religious person so
                    we had that orientation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was wondering, as a child, when you were growing up,
                        where did your family fall in the Jewish religious spectrum?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: Orthodox, which was the typical reaction. The reform was really mostly
                    German Jews. My parents were not observant, but my mother kept a kosher home. We
                    were not particularly observant, but my parents and I went to High Holiday
                    services in the orthodox synagogue wherever we lived. I guess that's the way it
                    went. I received a rather intensive Jewish education. They felt, even though
                    they were not themselves observant in an orthodox sense, they wanted me to have
                    training in this.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, the only child and a male child, at that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: Yes, a male child. And therefore, beginning with kindergarten I
                    attended Jewish Hebrew schools. They were called yeshivas. That was
                    kindergarten, first grade through eighth grade, and then to a high school with
                    the same orientation. All male, half a day traditional public school classes
                    taught by teachers who were teaching in the public school system; in the
                    afternoons we had them, in the mornings there were Jewish studies. Bible
                    language</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So essentially your schools were not public schools.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: Not public schools.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It sounds like you were in what amounted to a rather
                        constrained enclave in a way.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: Well, I wouldn't call it constrained as much as relatively isolated,
                    were it not for the fact that there were many of us, that we were friends with
                    one another.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about being out on the streets? What did you do for
                        fun?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: Let me give you an example. Beginning with the first grade, our
                    classes would begin at nine o'clock in the morning and ended at five o'clock at
                    night because you had two kinds of classes. And that was my schedule through
                    high school. Nine o'clock in the morning until five o'clock at night, which
                    didn't give you a great deal of time with respect to the streets after school.
                    Public school, for example, the elementary school - we were right across the
                    street from a public school - they were rather rough, threw rocks at us and that
                    kind of thing you'd expect in that kind of a neighborhood. On the other hand,
                    among my fellow students Babe Ruth was a hero; we knew what the Yankees were
                    doing, like ordinary kids.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: At some time I got a job even selling scorecards at Yankee Stadium for
                    a short period during the summers. So that was the schedule then. The exposure
                    to non-Jewish kids of our age was minimal. People working for my parents in the
                    stores were, in all cases I can remember, none Jews. They were friends. Our
                    familiarity with the non-Jewish communities as kids was that they would throw
                    rocks at us.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course this was New York and the Catholic kids were
                        going to Catholic schools and they were probably having rocks thrown at
                        them. They were kind of no-go areas.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: Exactly. That was my growing up. We had very good education, I felt,
                    through high school.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were eight by the time the Depression started to
                        develop and all. Was this sort of a continual presence, the economy, in your
                        family? As a kid, did you realize?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: I was shielded from the pressure. I knew my parents both worked, but
                    they shielded me from the negatives, except where we lived, but where we lived I
                    didn't know any better. I mean this was home.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, home is home. They're all the same digs. Really, as a
                        kid you don't notice this sort of thing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the family regarding politics and all? I mean
                        this is a time of great torment. Particularly in the Jewish community you
                        had the Socialists.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: My father was a democrat, not a socialist. I'm aware of the fact that
                    during that period the vast number of Jewish immigrants working in factories and
                    joining unions was socialists. My father was a Democrat. He somehow had met the
                    boss of the Democratic Party in New York, Flynn.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ah yes, Edward Flynn.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: He may have made a political contribution and was given a golden
                    badge, which he was very proud of, to show he was a democrat. So he was a
                    democrat. I remember as a kid, in the 1928 election of Al Smith, my father was
                    strongly for Al Smith.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As we move up to '32, was Roosevelt sort of a god in the
                        neighborhood, or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: Yes. He had been governor of New York and the people in New York were
                    all very proud of Roosevelt, were very accepting of Roosevelt. He was going to
                    get us out of the Depression. My father, as a democrat, was strong in this.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, to carry this a little farther on the political
                        side, how did La Guardia fit in here? He was a liberal republican.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: I have no recollection of my father's relationship to La Guardia, or
                    impressions of La Guardia. Mine was very favorable because I took a keen
                    interest also in politics as a child. So my impression of La Guardia was a high
                    plus.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And he read the comics too.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: He read the comics. That's right. He heard that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In your school what subjects particularly interested
                        you?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: For me, in the earlier classes it was civics. Public affairs matters.
                    In high school it was also civics and politics and government, American
                    government mostly. I was a good student. I was not the best in the class. As a
                    matter of fact, the best in the class happens to remain a friend. We lunched
                    about a year ago in New York. I've kept in touch with him over the years. His
                    last name began with a K, and mine with a K, so we would sit next to each other
                    frequently. I was a good student. I was not top of the class, but really a very
                    good student. I went through the learning of the Bible, but I would not say that
                    that was as interesting to me as my classes in civics.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about history? Did history interest you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: History interested me very much. The social sciences also did. At the
                    end of high school my mother would've wanted me - my father was then dead - and
                    said so, to continue with the yeshiva college and university in New York, and
                    maybe become a rabbi. But I knew even from the days that I was in elementary
                    school that that was not for me. I got the education and I enjoyed it, but I
                    really, as a child, began to think of myself as somebody who would be a
                    lawyer.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did Zionism raise its head at all at the yeshiva, or
                        not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: Not in a political sense, but very much in a religious and a
                    philanthropic sense. As a child, for example, we had a collection box in our
                    kitchen - even in the slums - where we were all taught to put in pennies; and
                    periodically a man with a beard or a rabbi would come by and collect it. A lot
                    of this was collecting for Israel, an orphan's home or something else. This was
                    of course long before Israel was a state but there was a commitment.</p>

                        much were you all following the news, not just in Germany, but all
                        over?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: Not as closely as my later years taught me I should have. The family
                    and the family's friends that clique knew what was happening, but really did not
                    know the intensity of what was happening and equated it with their own
                    experiences in Europe constantly running into anti-Semitism. This was not new
                    for them. It was kind of an assumption that European non-Jews would be
                    anti-Jews.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you and your family following the news on the radio
                        in those days much?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: I did, but not as seriously as in later years I thought I should
                    have.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, I think most of us felt that way. It was a time I
                        think people weren't distracted by the amusement factors of television and
                        all that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Did you go to movies? Were you allowed to go to movies?</p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: Yes, I was allowed to go to movies and went to movies. As a matter of
                    fact, when the family had the butcher shop, they were not Sabbath observers but
                    they kept a kosher home; and the butcher shop was not a kosher butcher shop. It
                    was just a butcher shop within the area and neighborhood, which was not Jewish
                    primarily. But I would go to the movies every Saturday afternoon because my
                    mother and father were working in the shop; and what could I do? There was a boy
                    named Buster who worked as an errand boy in the butcher shop. They would have
                    him take me to the movies. He'd drop me off and pick me up so I wouldn't have to
                    cross the streets. I also recall the policeman on the corner of the butcher shop
                    - his name was Mr. O'Mara - who became a dear friend of mine, and a hero. It
                    just comes to mind now as I talk to you.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, as one thinks about?These were real
                        neighborhoods.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: It was a real neighborhood.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about your teachers? Were there any teachers that
                        particularly inspired you or maybe disinspired you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: My impression is that I got along well with all the teachers in the
                    elementary school and I recall, as a matter of fact, the name of one lady who
                    taught first grade, Miss Pickelmy. I don't know why I think of her and her name
                    comes to mind. She obviously made a deep impression on me, a favorable
                    impression on me. The Jewish subjects were taught generally by rabbis; and the
                    English subjects and non-Jewish subjects were taught by teachers who were
                    teaching elsewhere. I recall high school teachers much more than I do the
                    elementary school, particularly the French teacher, because you know, you had to
                    study languages. Every high school student in the state of New York had to pass
                    the regents' examination.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And these were tough.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: These were tough and we worked very hard to prepare for those regents
                    examinations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I went to a New England prep school and they made us take
                        the New York regents exams. They were rough.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: They were rough. They were determined to have us do well.</p>
                <p>I remember the high school French teacher. I can't think of his name at the
                    moment, though I have his picture in my head. He began the first week by saying,
                    “I want you to write slowly an essay about Paris,” and we would write the essay
                    about Paris and he would correct it. And the next week the same essay about
                    Paris would be corrected and we'd go on and then we'd translate the simple
                    paragraphs into French from English, and then toward the end in preparation for
                    the regents; he said, “All right, now you're about to perform the regents. Let's
                    assume they ask you to write a paragraph about museums or about the movies. What
                    you say is, 'I saw a movie and it was in Paris. Paris is a beautiful city,' and
                    then go on with your thing.” 'I went to a museum; I saw something French. Paris
                    is a?”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [laughs]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: I remember that technique led us to do well in the exams.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By the time you got to high school where did you feel you
                        were all pointed towards?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: Most of the class felt they were pointed toward the rabbinate. All of
                    the class knew that they were pointing toward college and whatever other careers
                    they might want, teaching or whatnot, because not everybody in class ended up
                    going to the same college, the yeshiva college. But practically all did. I chose
                    not to. As I say, my mother regretted that, but I chose not to. I wanted to be a
                    lawyer and there was a college very near where we were then living, about four
                    or five blocks. So I enrolled in that college at New York University and they
                    called it the University Heights campus. It's now closed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was an extension of New York University?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: It was part of it. It was a campus of New York University, but it was
                    in the Bronx, not downtown. It was the university. It was really, I thought, the
                    Tiffany of the NYU, but nevertheless that's where I went. We had no money.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This would've been '36.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: No. I graduated high school in February of '37. So I enrolled there.
                    As I said, I had no money; I think I received a partial scholarship. But I asked
                    whether I could work and they said I could. And I would say that in the
                    three-and-a-half years that I was on that campus, because with getting out in
                    February I had to make up some courses, I earned more money than I did for a
                    number of years after I left college.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While you were in high school though, did you get involved
                        with the family butcher shop? By this time your father was in the
                        business?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: By that time we were in the ladies millinery business and I was
                    actively involved, particularly on weekends because my classes were nine to
                    five. Sometimes evenings. It was a retail shop. I would either serve as cashier
                    in the shop, and I was cashier in the butcher shop too, even though I was much
                    younger. I would either serve as cashier or, after my father died particularly,
                    my mother would send me downtown. We were in the Bronx not far from the subway;
                    the elevator became a subway. I would buy ladies' hats. The center of the
                    industry was at Thirty-Eighth Street in Manhattan. It was the center of the hat
                    trade.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was Dubinsky's, right?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: That's right. It was the center of the military trade. This was hats,
                    not garments.</p>
                <p>My mother would say, “I need three brown Milan straw.” So I would go to wherever
                    I was supposed to go and I'd say, “I want to buy three Milan straw,” and if I
                    had to make a choice, I made the choice. It was usually a good choice. Or she'd
                    say, “Bring home a dozen mixed,” because we would run out. Or special order; she
                    would call in a special order and I would go and pick it up.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This, of course, was the height of women and hats and New
                        York was the center?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: They all wore hats.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, they all did. There is a wonderful song by Danny Kaye
                        talking about Louis Dache and all of this about women's hats, which he ends
                        in “I hate women.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: My mother had help. There was a saleslady, I remember. Nelly McCarthy.
                    She was a member of the family, virtually.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I assume that in the hat shop there was a certain taste
                        and a certain cost that you fit the shop to your clientele.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: That's right. The clientele was medium; it wasn't impoverished. It was
                    not a slum.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find yourself as a young lad with these women
                        coming up and saying, “How do I look in this hat,” and all that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: Well, that was Nelly McCarthy's job, but I watched all these and would
                    sit watching all of this. I would sometimes sit when it was quiet doing
                    homework. This was every Saturday.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about at New York University; what type of jobs did
                        you have?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: You mean at the university?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: I got a job as a clerk in the bookstore and that lasted for my whole
                    period. I was able to get the concession for the checkroom for the weekly
                    dances. Every Saturday night there was a dance at one of the campus houses and I
                    persuaded the director and I was the check person. I never learned how to dance
                    at that point because I was never dancing, I was checking. But that provided
                    tips. I also had the concession for formal tuxedos at the end of each year for
                    the proms. I had the concession for The New York Times subscription. The New
                    York Times gave me cards and I'd distribute them out and if you want to
                    subscribe to The New York Times, see Max Kampelman at this telephone number;
                    he'll be at the bookstore. And then summers I worked as a busboy in the
                    Catskills, but I also?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What are some of the major ones that one hears about?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: Grossinger's. I never got into the majors, but I got into the good
                    resorts where there were tips.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get to hear the entertainers?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because so much of American humor came out of?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: That area and those people. And I did get to hear the entertainers. I
                    was not very good as a busboy. I confess to that. I was not very good. And I
                    only really did it for one period. I got fired from one place because I didn't
                    know how to make salads - or at least the boss didn't think I knew how to make
                    salads. I was not very good at that. As a result, other summers I worked in the
                    steel factory in Brooklyn, New York, and I sold Fuller brushes in the summer,
                    which was a difficult, hot job. And I remember we'd meet in the morning with the
                    regional director and in order to combat the disappointment of not making as
                    many sales the previous day as you would have liked, he would say, “Just
                    remember, the next person is spending a hundred dollars.” I sold magazines in
                    the summer. A variety of things. But I did earn money.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would think, in reflection, later on in your public
                        career, that sort of thing would give you something to go back to. I mean
                        selling, working in a factory.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: I suppose.</p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>Now, I graduated and did well. As senior I became president of the John Marshall
                    Law Society. As a junior in college I became the president of the Menorah
                    Society, which was the Jewish students group. And my qualifications for being
                    president as a junior were that I had been at the yeshiva as a high school
                    student and I was interested in this. And as a matter of fact, as president of
                    the NYU chapter - and we had a good chapter - we would have speakers come in on
                    occasion; and there was an inter-university Menorah Society which was centered
                    at Columbia University, and I was invited to be a part of that inter-university
                    group, which broadened the scope. I met people then from the other universities
                    in New York. The director was a Reform Rabbi by the name of Isador Hoffman, who
                    became a very dear friend of mine. He was the director of Columbia and he guided
                    all of us because we did not have a Jewish chaplain on our campus; there was one
                    on the downtown NYU campus, but not on our campus. So I used him as a kind of
                    chaplain - I had him come up and speak at NYU - and we became friends until he
                    died, as a matter of fact. Many years ago, indeed, he performed the marriage
                    ceremony for my wife and me.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How wonderful.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: Many years later.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Again, you were at New York University from February of
                        '37 until?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: Until June of '40.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A very important date.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: A very important date, that's right.</p>
                <p>I also became chairman of the John Marshall Law Society. I always had that in
                    mind. I became a member and they elected me chairman when I was a senior.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All hell was breaking loose in Europe during your time.
                        Were you reading The New York Times?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: Yes. I was quite interested and I had extraordinarily good professors
                    on that campus and they totally broadened my horizons. We talked a lot. I chose
                    political science as a major. I had extraordinarily good teachers; I read a lot;
                    I wrote papers; I spent time at the New York Public Library when I had an
                    important paper to do; I did a lot of reading; and I was a good student. Not an
                    excellent student, but a very good student.</p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any feeling, during this time, about
                        discrimination against Jews and so on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: We were all very much aware, particularly our Jewish group, of Hitler
                    and of the anti-Semitism in Europe. But it was far from us.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Anti-Semitism was pretty strong in the United States at
                        this time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: We did not experience it on that campus. I was fortunate in that
                    regard. I will say this: the Jewish students managed to keep to themselves; the
                    non-Jewish students managed to keep to themselves. There were a lot of them in
                    the engineering school, which was on the same campus. But at the John Marshall
                    Law Society we had it mixed and maybe I was insensitive, but I was not conscious
                    of a problem on campus.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Also, New York was different.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: We had a lot of Jews on campus. New York University had a lot of Jews
                    on all of its campuses. It wasn't City College which had more Jews; we had a lot
                    of Jews on campus. And my professors were all non-Jewish, interestingly enough.
                    But they became good teachers and good friends.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where were you pointed towards?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: I was pointed toward the law.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Any particular school?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: No, but when I graduated in June and decided to go to law school, I
                    knew I had to go to night law school and work during the day. There was no other
                    way that I could do that. And the best night law school in the city was at New
                    York University. So I enrolled there. But I do want to add one thing? when I was
                    on the college campus I became an anti-Stalinist, an anti-communist, and
                    specialized in studies on democracy. I had a professor, Arnold Zurcher, who
                    taught political science and we studied Marxism and political theory. My total
                    instinct was against dictatorship and against the communists. There was a
                    communist clique on campus and I found myself actively engaged in an
                    anti-communist clique on campus.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Emotions ran pretty high.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: Very high.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's hard to imagine, but communism had a great deal of
                        attraction, particularly in New York and often coming out of the Jewish
                        social democratic strain that came out of Germany, I guess.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: It fit in.</p>
                <p>I also had a professor who taught social legislation and remained my friend until
                    he died, Jack McConnell; we kept in close touch with each other. And that too
                    strengthened my identity with the New Deal. But he also did one other thing; he
                    recommended that I spend a month, my last summer in college, with a Quaker work
                    camp. He felt that it would be good for me to do that; that they were socially
                    oriented. This was a work camp in Reading, Pennsylvania, working with the
                    American Federation of Hosiery Workers - a trade union - and a Quaker work camp
                    in a slum. I was able to get a scholarship for that, which meant that I didn't
                    work for that month, but I took his advice and enrolled and spent the month
                    there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: We were fixing up slum buildings. Some of these homes were for trade
                    union workers; others were not - slum homes. It was mostly a black area, but not
                    solely black. We did, in a sense, what Habitat (Habitat for Humanity) does now.
                    I made lasting friendships in that Quaker work camp. The director of the camp
                    recently wrote me; he's close to a hundred years old, still alive; he's in
                    Quaker retirement, David Richey. He and his wife became dear friends. One of our
                    campers is the wife of a minister who just died last month here in Chevy Chase.
                    We keep in touch with each other. She married a Methodist minister.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you find that the Quaker approach to no war and
                        all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: It influenced me. It influenced me a great deal. The power of love. I
                    read Tolstoy; I read the Quakers; and I really became a conscientious objector.
                    But I became an anti-communist conscientious objector, if you know what I
                    mean.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: It didn't blind me. It also didn't blind me to the existence of
                    evils.</p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>I kept in touch with the Quakers all during my law school days and the essence of
                    what persuaded me to be a CO at the time was that wars and violence don't solve
                    the problem. The elimination of evil requires something different from killing
                    people.</p>
                <p>We read Gandhi about his success with the British and his non-violent approaches.
                    So I became a conscientious objector. I joined the pacifist organizations. I
                    joined the Fellowship for Reconciliation. I joined the War Resisters League.
                    That's how I met Norman Thomas, Evan Thomas' brother, who was the grandfather of
                    the columnist here. I identified myself.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The draft started in 1940, didn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you were eligible as all hell at that point.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: I was and I registered under the Selective Service Act as a
                    conscientious objector.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And what happened then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: I was granted status as a conscientious objector. They called it IV-E.
                    The draft board - I came in; I had letters of my activities - and they had no
                    problem assigning me. As I said to you, this was all while I was going to law
                    school at night. I was a busy man. During the day I worked as a steamer in a
                    sweater factory and joined the International Garment Workers Union. Now, that's
                    interesting. Among the people I met at NYU (New York University), besides Jack
                    McConnell, was the Christian protestant chaplain - a man by the name of Frank
                    Olmsted, who became a very good friend of mine. I was chairman of the Menorah
                    Society, he wanted to get acquainted with me, and I found a friend. And he was a
                    friend in every way. He also urged me to go to the Quaker work camp. When I left
                    college and enrolled in night law school, he knew I had to work, and arranged
                    for me to meet with some leader of the Garment Workers Union enabling me to get
                    the job as a steamer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was David Dubinsky's outfit.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: Yes. This was David Dubinsky's outfit. I was very, very interested in
                    unions and social things so that while I was working as a steamer in a factory I
                    joined that union - it was Local 155, the knit goods workers union. The
                    president was a man by the name of Louis Nelson. I did that for about a year, in
                    the factory, during which I occasionally, when I had time, would get active and
                    then Louis Nelson would ask me to leave the shop and do education work in his
                    Local, which I did. So I worked for the union for about a year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tell me about this union because, for somebody who doesn't
                        know the history of unions, it sounds like a rather hum-drum thing. But this
                        was a power house.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: It was a power house and it was a life that became a member's life.
                    You had a social life. They had a resort in upstate New York for members of the
                    union. You had a social life, you made friends, and they produced improved
                    conditions for their workers. There was no question about it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I mean we're talking about sweatshops.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: These were a lot of sweatshops and they were getting rid of
                    sweatshops. I did not work in a sweatshop; I worked in a regular factory but
                    belonged to the union.</p>
                <p>And then Nelson introduced me to the lawyer for the Garment Workers Union - the
                    big union, overall - a man by the name of Elias Lieberman. Lieberman enrolled me
                    to help him and together we went to Washington and had a hearing before the Wage
                    and Hour Board and abolished industrial homework. I did a lot of that work,
                    going to law school at night and during the day I would interview working women
                    at home. They would have sewing machines and they would get paid piece work. And
                    I studied many, many of them and analyzed their piece work and the number of
                    hours they were working. By definition the employee was not paying the minimum
                    wage, but much less than the minimum wage.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, that was the whole idea of this.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: And we demonstrated that to the Wage and Hour Board and the Wage and
                    Hour Board issued a ruling making it illegal in that trade to do that. Again,
                    Elias Lieberman and I became friends until his death, and as a matter of fact,
                    his niece and I had lunch about six months ago. She came to Washington and she
                    wanted to talk to me. She had seen my name mentioned.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get involved in clashes with the communists?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: Yes. Let me tell you where I got involved. Not with the union so much
                    because this union had already defeated the communists. But in law school I got
                    involved. In law school, I joined the first year I was there something called
                    the American Law Students Association. They saw that I was working in unions so
                    they invited me in to become a leader. That organization was being captured by
                    the communists nationally, and we were not. We were on the other side. Columbia
                    University had a chapter that was also mostly on the other side, but mixed. I
                    met students from Columbia University as well as New York University and we
                    organized a fight against the communist control.</p>
                <p>Interestingly enough, the head of our Columbia group lives here in Washington and
                    was a member of the Atomic Energy Commission. He's regrettably now with
                    Alzheimer's and I'm going to be visiting him this weekend. His wife, who
                    entertained us and fed us Saturday nights before they were married, was then
                    dating him. She was a professor at Queens College and she was the first woman
                    professor at Georgetown University's College of Medicine. But be that as it may,
                    we worked and I went to Washington on the weekend with our group for a
                    convention where we met Abe Fortas, who helped us, and Felix Cohen, who helped
                    us, and I got acquainted with them during that time. Yes, we had that fight. We
                    won it while we were there, but after we left law school the communists took
                    over the organization and their organization doesn't exist anymore.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think this is a good place to stop. And I'll put here
                        that we've talked about your time with the garment workers, at law school,
                        the fight with the communists. I don't know. Is there anything else we
                        should cover at the law school or things that were going on then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: No. The only other thing was that toward the last year in law school
                    one of my professors arranged for me to have a clerkship with one of the leading
                    law firms in New York - Phillips, Nizer, Benjamin and Krim. Louis Nizer was a
                    giant of a lawyer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I read his book.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: That was an important move. I learned a lot, it permitted me to take
                    the bar examination before I received a law degree because the Court of Appeals
                    permitted people who were conscripted to take the exam, but they couldn't be
                    lawyers until after they got their degree, but it permitted them to take it
                    before they got their degree. Louis Nizer offered me a job after the war and we
                    became good friends.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well we'll talk about the Nizer period and all that.</hi>

                <p>KAMPELMAN: He had a number of books. One book that you may be thinking of is
                    called Thinking on Your Feet. His books dealt with reprints of speeches he had
                    made as well as some lessons he had learned.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think there was a story of his life or something.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: There is a life story book.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You said you learned a lot from him. Could we talk about
                        what you were picking up, because this was influential in your later
                        life?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: When you're a clerk you're the low person down on the totem pole. I
                    was going to night school. It was a very active law firm, and most mornings I
                    went straight from my home to the courthouse, having picked up the previous day
                    papers to be filed. So I'd go straight to the courthouse, do my job, then come
                    back to 1501 Broadway, which is where they had their offices, and I would do
                    some research, do some errands - make myself useful to the many lawyers in that
                    firm. I was the only clerk and being surrounded by the lawyers, all of whom were
                    very nice and helpful - talking to me about my studies, I learned much of the
                    law.</p>
                <p>On a rare occasion, when I would get down to the courthouse and a motion would
                    have to be argued - I can't think of this happening more than two or three
                    times, if that - if the lawyer was late and the judge was calling the motion up
                    for argument, I just stood up and made the argument. I never said I wasn't a
                    lawyer; I'm sure he assumed I was a lawyer. There's nothing illegal about it.
                    But since I knew what was involved?But that was rare. Normally what I would do
                    is if this was a proceeding I would try to sit through as much of it as I can to
                    learn how it's done.</p>
                <p>I remember one case involving a terrible accident and Louis Nizer was handling
                    the litigation in court. He was really the chief litigator of the firm, an
                    eloquent man. Here I knew the particulars of this case - it had been in the firm
                    for many, many months - I studied it and I knew the business, and yet as I heard
                    him arguing the case tears came to my eyes. He was that good. So this was what I
                    meant when I said that I learned many things about the law which permitted me to
                    be a bit more comfortable.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you ever find yourself morally tested about picking up
                        cases that really stunk, in taking the wrong side of a stinking case?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: No, I never did. It's a good question, but I never did. The nature of
                    that firm's practice was hardly any rich versus poor or right versus wrong. It
                    was primarily rich versus rich. The firm emphasized motion pictures, theater,
                    art world.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think this is where Louis Nizer came into the public
                        eye, in the entertainment business. He became a part of show biz.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: Right, and when you're in that kind of atmosphere Columbia Pictures is
                    fighting MGM - it isn't quite in that category.</p>
                <p>I also did one of the things that I should not ignore because it was an important
                    part. Louis Nizer did a great deal of research when he made a speech. He was not
                    flippant about the responsibility. I learned that. I am not flippant about my
                    speeches. I take care. But he had me do a lot of research for his speeches. Now
                    that's not legal research particularly, but it's research. And I learned the
                    importance of preparation - preparation for a law case, preparation for a speech
                    appearance - and it's been with me for the rest of my life, the preparation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And diplomacy too. Diplomacy in many ways has a lot.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: In many ways it's involved in the process.</p>
                <p>There were also interesting sidelights. Bob Benjamin, Benjamin and Krim, was
                    dating an actress, Susan Hayward. At one point he was having lunch with her and
                    he was late and he said, “Max, do me a favor and take Ms. Hayward to lunch.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: She was a real beauty.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: She was a beautiful lady and I did take her to lunch. He joined us
                    later but we had interesting conversation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How old were you then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: Well, I was going to law school. It would've been 1940; I would've
                    been twenty years old.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Pretty heavy stuff.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: That's right. Pretty heavy stuff.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well all of a sudden you got caught up in the war.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: I did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk about that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: Alright. I registered as a conscientious objector. The law says that a
                    conscientious objector whose claim is recognized by his draft board should be
                    conscripted to do work of national importance under civilian direction. That was
                    what the law said under Section IV-E of the Selective Service Act. A number of
                    conscientious objectors objected to that. They objected to the concept of
                    conscription. I did not. I then, having majored in political science, believed a
                    society has a right to defend itself; a society has a right to conscript if its
                    national interest requires it. So I never had any problems with that. It
                    permitted me to do work of national importance; I said that's what I would do. I
                    could not envisage myself killing anybody. But there was another factor, which
                    was my mother. My mother had a dear, dear brother who was killed in the First
                    World War in Europe. When I as a kid at one point decided I wanted to be a Boy
                    Scout - and I did, even as a yeshiva student - I talked to my mother about it
                    and indeed - I don't remember now what I showed her - she started to cry. I was
                    named after her brother and I therefore never joined the Boy Scouts because she
                    didn't want me to.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because it was too militaristic? Was that it? The
                        uniform?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: The uniform was militaristic. So I had that influence on my life also
                    and I don't deny that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the draft board? This was a draft board where?
                        Because all these were basically local citizens.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: All people from the Bronx, New York.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did they have problems with you? Because there were people
                        who were part of the society, friends and all that, and it's fairly simple
                        to say, “I've always grown up in this climate”. A young lad could come up
                        and say this without?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: Well, I had to present a written statement, which I did. I also
                    submitted myself for an interview - a long interview - and I had no problems
                    with them. They asked intelligent questions. They wanted to see consistency and
                    I showed them consistency with the Quakers and my activity in the pacifist
                    movement, and they gave me no trouble. Many draft boards did cause difficulty
                    and as a result an appeals board was established so that somebody could go above
                    whatever local prejudices might exist on the draft board to an appeal board. But
                    I never had to. My draft board just said fine.</p>
                <p>Now my first assignment?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Excuse me. When was this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: Sometime at the end of 1941.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Forty-one, okay. This was prior to our entry into the war.
                        We didn't go to war until December of '41.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: This would have been prior.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But the draft was still there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: The draft was there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Very closely; it almost died by one vote.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: I'm a little uncertain in my head now about exactly when that was, but
                    it was around 1941. It might've been early '42. One or the other; I can't vouch
                    for that.</p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>My assignment was to go to a conservation camp - soil conservation - run by the
                    Department of Agriculture in Big Flats, New York, which was near Elmira, New
                    York. This old CCC (Civilian Conservation Corps) camp was still run by the
                    Department of Agriculture and our task was to clean out the forests, cut trees
                    where the experts said they should be cut and clean them out, and then also in
                    other areas plant trees. I arrived at this camp and I think there were
                    approximately forty of us there in the camp. We lived in camp facilities. It was
                    very hard physical work, but it was also work that was good for my health. It
                    was good, hard work. And I worked at it. Most of the campers were church-going
                    people - Quakers, Quaker sympathizers, some Mennonites, and some Church of the
                    Brethren - and some what one might call intellectual pacifists like me. As a
                    matter of fact, I made good friendships there. They were wonderful people to be
                    with. All different educational levels.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did being Jewish fit into this particular brand of
                        Christianity?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: I was the only Jew in the camp and I talked about it. They were
                    curious about it and I knew something about it. I never experienced the
                    slightest bit of discrimination or prejudice in all of the years I was in
                    civilian public service. They respected it, they were curious about it, and we
                    talked about it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was going to say this particular brand of Christianity,
                        just looking at it and knowing a little about them, is not what you would
                        call the redneck type, fundamentalist.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: They were fundamentalist in some ways, but not intellectually. A
                    number of farm boys from the Mennonite or Brethren activity were there. They
                    worked very hard. They were all conscientious. I guess I was there close to a
                    year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the leadership - the Department of Agriculture
                        people?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: It was a technical leadership. It was a camp run by the American
                    Friend Service Committee, the Quakers. The camp director was a Quaker assigned
                    by the Society of Friend Service Committee to direct us. He and his wife were
                    there. If I remember, she was the cook and he was the director. A very, very
                    nice man named Osgood. He was the director; that is, he made sure that things
                    were running well. On occasion we were permitted, if we wanted to, to go to
                    Elmira on a Sunday or a certain Saturday. If any of these people wanted to go to
                    church, they could go. We were free to move around once we did our work. But the
                    camp was an isolated camp. It was not within a larger community.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any problem with the local townsfolk?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: No. We were not exposed that much to the local townsfolk, but we had
                    no problems with them. Those who went to church would certainly not have any
                    problems and the church was not just Brethren or Mennonite or Quaker. There were
                    also, I would say, three or four of them who would go to a normal Christian
                    church. They might be Methodists, for example, or Catholics.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You did this for about a year.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: For about a year. Then a notice was distributed - frequently notices
                    were distributed - and this was a notice asking for volunteers who would be
                    willing to work in an institution for feeble-minded children in Pownal, Maine. I
                    decided to apply. I wanted to do something with human beings and this was an
                    opportunity to do it, and I was accepted. So I shifted from Big Flats, New York
                    to Pownal, Maine, which was not too far from Portland. And there I was assigned
                    as a nurse in a hospital for feeble-minded children.</p>
                <p>My first assignment was quite a shocker because it was really with human
                    vegetables, but humans. And I served as a nurse.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you given any training?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: While I was there the director trained me. And I was not the only one;
                    there were four or five of us there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you deal with these people that were in such a
                        condition that they were?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: They were human beings. They couldn't talk. There were an awful lot of
                    those children. It is the ones I was assigned to care for. All you could do was
                    care. Wash, clean. You communicated; you talked, hoping they would understand
                    something. It was difficult. It was a very difficult period. And after a few
                    months the director came to me and asked me how I would feel if he transferred
                    me to the farm. The spring was coming - growth season - and apparently they had
                    patients who were working on the farm. Would I be willing to do that? He could
                    have assigned me to that, but he asked me and I said yes. So I moved from the
                    hospital to the farm where I learned how to drive. I never had driven an
                    automobile.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were a real city boy.</hi>
                </p>

                <p>KAMPELMAN: A real city boy. I had never driven automobiles. I learned how to
                    drive a tractor, as well as an automobile. And here were older feeble-minded
                    human beings with whom you could converse. All of them had been there a long,
                    long time - years and years. Really, I have to say, lovely human beings. I don't
                    know a better word to say.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I've heard that they're very gentle souls.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: Gentle souls. Lovely, lovely people. And I got attached to them. As a
                    matter of fact, the institution at Pownal was not too far from a railroad track.
                    I don't think it was an active railroad track, but periodically the trains would
                    come. Well some of these people I was working with had never been out of the
                    camp in twenty years, thirty years; they had been there a long time, and as I
                    said, we became very good friends. So I went to the director and I asked him how
                    he would feel if I took two or three of them every Saturday night to town and I
                    bought them hamburgers and walk around. And he agreed. He was a very nice man, a
                    broad minded man, and so I did that. And of course for them it was heaven. That
                    added some spice to their lives.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You know, one hears about, after time, almost the
                        brutality of the people who are perpetually taking care of people who can't
                        take care of themselves. One, it's hard to hire people, and two, it's a
                        numbing experience. Did you see that in the staff there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: Not a bit. Not a bit. Our unit's staff director - there were four or
                    five of us and one of them was our director who later became a clergyman. He was
                    absolutely terrific. And as a matter of fact, he ended up marrying the cook - a
                    young lady, a lovely lady - and I kept in touch with them for years. But I want
                    to say there weren't many of the CPS (Civilian Public Service) people like me in
                    feeble-minded institutions. More went in mental institutions, I'm guessing we
                    had people in maybe a dozen mental institutions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That would be quite difficult, I would think.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: And that was quite difficult.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because these were people who had different
                        manifestations.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: And that was difficult. I never was there, but in talking to them
                    later over the years they injected humanity - and this has been written up - in
                    the treatment wherever they were. They found brutality in many instances.
                    Articles were written about how they injected a new approach into treatments and
                    it worked apparently.</p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>Then a notice went around again - another notice - saying that the Church of the
                    Brethren Service Committee, not the Friends Service Committee, was looking for
                    volunteers among our group to be human guinea pigs in a starvation experiment. I
                    thought about it and I volunteered to do that. I was interviewed in Boston by, I
                    remember, three physicians who would be part of that experiment - Henry Taylor,
                    who was a cardiologist, and August Henchel, I remember, who was a physiologist.
                    They interviewed me and gave me an examination. Of course I had been in good
                    health as a result of the conservation camp and now working on the farm. So they
                    accepted me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So this would be about '43 or so?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: Roughly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was this about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: Okay, so I reported to the University of Minnesota, which is where the
                    experiment was being held. The director of the experiment was a man by the name
                    of Dr. Ansel Keyes. You know the K-ration?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: The “K” stands for Keyes. He developed the K-ration.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was the standard ration for our military. I knew of
                        it, but I came in the era of the C-ration, which was a little better.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: A little better, but this was the K-ration.</p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>I found that we were headquartered in the basement of their large football field.
                    There was room in the basement. I guess it was originally for dressing rooms.
                    There were about forty of us from different parts of the country who had
                    volunteered and been accepted. I learned many more volunteered than were
                    accepted. It was explained to us that there had been no studies available on
                    human starvation, which surprised me. Their purpose would be to first put us all
                    on an equal standard of health and diet and that would take a number of weeks -
                    I think six weeks; I don't remember now - where we would eat the same food,
                    every one of us, the same amount, the same everything. Secondly, we would then
                    be put on starvation regiment for six, eight months, something like that. We
                    would be divided, without our knowing where we are, into different groups and
                    each group would have a different rehabilitation treatment with different
                    vitamins, calories, minerals - whatever the experts decided. Let me say to you
                    the result of it was two volumes, which I have in my library, the only
                    authoritative work. I am still receiving visits from physiologists - not many
                    now. Six months ago or so somebody from Canada called and came to visit. Again,
                    these two volumes are the only authoritative work that today exists in the
                    field.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you give a bit of a background on why we'd be doing
                        this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: Why as a country?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: Oh yes, it was explained. A) Concentration camp victims and prisoners
                    of war. That's why the Defense Department financed this. The responsibility was
                    civilian but the money came from the Defense Department. Ansel Keyes had
                    persuaded the Defense Department to put up the money. As a matter of fact, they
                    became so eager for this that they would be pressing Keyes for reports even
                    before he was ready to make any final reports. I got down to about 100 pounds.
                    Now, we were told that we could eat nothing other than what they gave us. We
                    would live there underneath the football field in cots, which was fine; we would
                    be examined physically every day; there was to be a treadmill every single day
                    and a blood test every single day. We were also to do exercise outside of the
                    exercise they had. My recollection is we were to walk forty-five miles a week.
                    Now, don't hold me to that, but I think I'm correct.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But in that area anyway.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: Forty-five miles a week. The university was right along the
                    Mississippi River. They designated how many miles from one point to the other so
                    that we knew if we went from point A to point B it was three miles, if we'd go
                    to point C it was five miles and we would do this every day when we could.</p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you doing this in the winter? I think you'd be going
                        through knee-deep snow.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: We were. There was no question about it. We did it. As a matter of
                    fact, we were written up in the Minneapolis newspapers, always in a constructive
                    way. I never felt that it was negative. As I said earlier, I took the bar exam
                    in New York without getting a law degree, but I couldn't practice law without
                    getting that degree. Shortly after I got there I went to the dean of the
                    Minnesota law school - Dean Frazier, I remember?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was the law school of Minnesota?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: Of Minnesota. You see our laboratory was right on campus. So I went to
                    the dean at the law school and I identified myself. He knew by then about the
                    experiment because it was around and we all wore the same kind of uniform anyhow
                    - it wasn't a uniform, but it was civilian sweatshirt and I asked him if he
                    thought I could take courses if NYU law school would agree to accept the credits
                    of Minnesota. Would he permit me to take courses that I needed and I would ask
                    NYU to tell me what courses I needed. His son later became a congressman, Don
                    Frazier?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh yes, very well-known.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: ?and then he became mayor of Minneapolis. And I saw Don Frazier about
                    a year ago. We're good friends.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He's very liberal.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: He's kind of a democratic liberal, on the left side of the Democratic
                    Party. A lovely, lovely man. His father was really an unusual and gifted man.
                    Anyhow, he said, “Yes, by all means.” So I wrote to the dean of NYU and he said
                    yes. So I took, I think, the two or three courses I was missing by going to the
                    Minnesota law school.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This, of course, was during war time, but all the bets
                        were off later. All the universities got very possessive about their
                        thing.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: I had no problem. Within one term I got it all done and then I decided
                    to take other courses. By then I'd met some people around campus. I majored in
                    political science in college, so I took political science courses. Let me say
                    that the two volume work, which did not mention names but numbers - I recognized
                    myself and was told what number I am when the book came out - I came out of that
                    experiment with the least psychological damage of any of the forty. Ansel had a
                    staff psychologist full-time - Josef Brozek, who is still in Minnesota - they're
                    convinced it was the courses that led to least psychological damage.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was wondering why you were doing this. From what I
                        gather this was more a physical test to see how you could rehabilitate
                        people. But were you getting psychological tests?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: Constantly. We had a full-time psychologist. We had to keep a diary
                    every single day of dreams and anything else that we did. As I said, the
                    psychologists worked with us constantly, as well as the physical sciences,
                    because they were looking for psychological damage also.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there at a certain point when people's minds started
                        going to food and away from sex and all this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: Let me say, the sex drive disappeared with starvation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It goes very quickly.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: It goes very quickly.</p>
                <p>I'm about to make a statement that I can't prove, but I believe that every single
                    one of the campers except me began collecting cookbooks and recipes. An
                    interesting development. Their minds were so preoccupied with food. It did not
                    hit me as something that I would want to do and it's probably because I was
                    taking courses. (End of tape)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was just saying I finished reading recently a book
                        called The Ghost Soldiers about American prisoners of the Japanese. Much of
                        the time they would sit around and create mental meals in loving
                        detail.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: That's what happened here. Brozek, the psychologist, was a Czech,
                    originally born in Czechoslovakia. He was dating a girl whom he later married.
                    We became good friends and he introduced me to his lady friend's good friend. So
                    I had a lady friend soon after I got there. She'd walk with me sometimes - a
                    lovely lady who lives here in Washington today she married a very nice fellow.
                    But I wanted to say to you, right after this initial period not only did the sex
                    drive disappear, but I really wasn't as friendly as I should have been to a
                    friend.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well when people get more and more isolated?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: More and more isolated, I felt. And yet I want to say that the faculty
                    and the students were fine to us and I made a point very early on, particularly
                    during the first phasof going to the synagogues in Minneapolis. I wanted them to
                    know I was there and I just wanted to develop relationships. Again, I made
                    lasting friendships there. The rabbi at one of the synagogues later became a
                    rabbi here in Washington. My wife and I visited him and his wife last Sunday. So
                    it's a long relationship. But I met him at the synagogue in Minneapolis.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While you were doing this, from the chronology it sounds
                        like around '43, '44.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: Forty-three, '44, '45.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was wondering whether the enormity of what happened in
                        Germany and the concentration camps - and for American soldiers too - and
                        just the depravation of food in Italy and other places, was this something
                        that you all were aware of?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: Yes. Not as much. The concentration camp existence didn't really come
                    in until later.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, it was really almost after the war.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: But my colleagues were intelligent people, the forty of us.
                    Incidentally, one of them left the experiment after an accident which chopped
                    off a finger. The psychologist was convinced that this was a psychological act.
                    He was a deeply religious Quakeand I'm sure he never voluntarily would have left
                    that experiment. It was stressful. I mean no sense kidding about this. It was
                    stressful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh yes.</hi>

                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: But I met a lot of people also and they were very nice to me. I had no
                    problems. And I was taking courses.</p>
                <p>Let me say to you that I began to question my pacifism with Hiroshima and
                    Nagasaki.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're talking about the nuclear bombs that went off in
                        those two places at the end of the war with Japan. This was August of 1945
                        about.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: You know I had been taking courses in political science. The faculty
                    was a young faculty and they became friends of mine as well as teachers. My
                    commitment to pacifism had, I'm sure, without even my knowing it, all different
                    categories - one of which was a reading in Tolstoy and Gandhi and the power of
                    love instead of killing. The Indians did it. With the dropping of the atom bomb
                    I remember thinking to myself this doesn't work. These guys flying up there
                    never see the damage they're inflicting down below. How do you reach people who
                    are attacking? This is not going to work. You either accept evil or you resist
                    it, and the power of love is not capable of resisting it. That had a very
                    profound effect on me and I began to talk to the political scientists about it
                    and I began to think too. By then the war was coming to an end.</p>
                <p>The authorities asked me to stay on after the experiment and the war in order to
                    close up the unit. 1946 came and the war was over. My faculty friends told me I
                    had earned a master's degree in Political Science and was working toward a
                    doctorate degree. It appeared as if I was practically all through with the
                    coursework for the doctorate degree. They asked whether I would like to be an
                    instructor of political science. They said they would make me an instructor if I
                    agreed to finish my doctorate. I had to make a career decision. They knew I was
                    a lawyer. So I thought about it and since I thoroughly enjoyed the intellectual
                    challenge in teaching political science, I thought I would stay at Minnesota. I
                    wrote to Louis Nizer. He had offered me a job for after the war. I explained
                    that I was offered this teaching position and that I wanted to try it and he
                    wrote me back saying that he wanted me to know that if after a couple years I
                    decided that I wanted to go back to law I should not hesitate. So I became a
                    member of the faculty, got a master's degree, and finished my course work for
                    the doctorate and a new world opened up for me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you talk a bit about political science in the latish
                        '40s and how it was taught? Because to my mind political science today is a
                        whole different...which I consider - I mean I have to state my prejudice -
                        crazy. Starting at that period, how was political science taught and what
                        was the outlook?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: Our department, which was a great department, I've got to say?</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. Minnesota is one of the major universities?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: We resisted turning political science into sociology with equations
                    and predictions and the effort to make it a science. Our emphasis in that
                    department in the courses I took and the courses I taught - for example, I
                    taught one course which was called Humanities in the Modern World where we went
                    into Freud, Lenin, Karl Marx, D.H. Lawrence. The political science department
                    and sociology joined up. I taught a section of that. I taught a course in a
                    seminar called “Problems of Democracy,” which was a tremendous course. I think
                    the students and I liked it. We did not go into the formula business, which is
                    where political science has drifted.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which strikes me as a bunch of alchemists looking for the
                        philosopher's stone.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: Exactly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You know, the right equation and you've solved it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: Exactly, and we can then make a prediction.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You must have found the student body, particularly I think
                        probably the greatest set of student body that we've ever had, and that was
                        the veterans coming back.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: Yes. It couldn't be better. It was stimulating. We had serious young
                    men and women, mostly men but also some women. It was a pleasure to teach and I
                    was a good teacher and a good member of the faculty.</p>
                <p>I liked to teach freshman, the introductory course - preference - because you get
                    more of the kids there than you do later on. I'm still in touch with some of my
                    students. So that opened up a new life for me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well how were you looking at some of the aspects, for
                        example, as you were doing this; I mean the enormity of what was the Third
                        Reich, of Hitler, and also the battles that were going on still of the
                        intellectuals sort of having this love affair with communism and excusing
                        the enormities of Stalin's Soviet Union and all this? Did you find yourself
                        having battles or dealing with this?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: No and yes. That's a good question. I think I mentioned that when I
                    was in college we were battling communists. Fortunately the political science
                    faculty at the University of Minnesota shared my anti-Stalinist, anti-communist
                    perspectives, without a doubt. My faculty adviser was a man by the name of Evron
                    Kirkpatrick, later the husband of Jeane Kirkpatrick.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: He was a political scientist of distinction at that time and he was my
                    faculty advisor on my doctorate work. You ask about the politics and the
                    Stalinist business. The students knew the point of view of our department and my
                    point of view, because I never hid it; we talked about it. And you know they
                    always liked a good fight and so they would arrange debates for speeches and I
                    always responded affirmatively and was active on campus. Frequently my opponent
                    would be a man by the name of Papandreou, who was an instructor of economics at
                    the University of Minnesota.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh my god. I was consul general in Athens for four years
                        when the colonels were there and Papandreou came up a great deal.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: Okay.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was Dimitri, wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: Yes, Dimitri or Andrei, I don't remember. I had breakfast with his son
                    some weeks ago here in Washington. His son is now the Greek Foreign Minister.
                    Frequently, his father who became the Greek Prime Minister, and I would debate
                    on campus. After Reykjavik, when I was in Reykjavik with Reagan?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was during the latter part of the Reagan
                        administration.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: After Reykjavik Reagan assigned an Air Force airplane to me and they
                    took me to various capitols in Europe to explain Reykjavik from our point of
                    view. One of those was Greece and I was to meet with the heads of state. It may
                    have been the year you may have been there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, I wasn't there at that time. This was during the
                        mid-'80s.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: Well, I land at the airport and I don't remember who the ambassador
                    was but he met me there and said, “Mr. Papandreou invited you to have dinner
                    with him tonight,” - and I haven't seen him since Minnesota - “at his home in
                    the country,” wherever that was. I said, “Fine. What time are you going to pick
                    me up?” He said, “I'm not invited.” So I said, “You call the people in his
                    office and you say that I don't go to a meeting with the prime minister without
                    my ambassador being there.” Just as firm as that. He called me back a little bit
                    later at the hotel and he says, “It worked. I'll pick you up. I'm going there.”
                    So we go there and he greets me warmly. I hadn't seen him in years and he
                    embraced me and greeted me warmly; we talked about old times. I don't remember
                    how it came about but the occasion arose where I said to him, “My friend, at
                    that time I thought that if you were not a member of the Communist Party you
                    were cheating the party out of dues.” The ambassador's face got white. Blood is
                    draining down. Papandreou laughs and says, “Well, what do you think now?” I
                    said, “Well that's why I'm here. I want to find out if you wised up!” We had a
                    wonderful evening.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a core - because this was an interesting period
                        in our society; we were beginning to move into McCarthyism. I know one of my
                        professors when I was in college was Frederick Schumann, who was one of the
                        people pointed to early on by McCarthy. We were beginning to feel that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: On our campus there was always a left-wing unit, as there was on every
                    campus. Frankly it was concentrated in physics and chemistry and not in either
                    economics or political science.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's interesting.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: In our campus. I should say that I had earlier referred to my dealings
                    in the trade union role, and of my friends. A friend of mine showed up in
                    Minneapolis working with the Textile Workers Union. We had communists in the
                    trade union movement in Minnesota. As a matter of fact, they controlled the CIO.
                    “Max, would you be willing to advise our local chapter people, because we want
                    to fight this element?” So I became an adviser - got a little money for it - for
                    the Textile Workers Union. We had a chapter of the American Federation of
                    Teachers. I joined the union. I was assigned, or volunteered - I don't remember
                    - to be on the executive committee of the citywide AFL; it was not then the CIO.
                    Again, we had to struggle there and I was active in both of these issues.</p>
                <p>Next, the political science department at the University of Minnesota - young
                    people mostly - most every Saturday night we met socially at the home of Herb
                    McCloskey or Evron Kirkpatrick; he was then married to another lady. Who would
                    show up frequently at eleven, ten o'clock at night? The newly elected mayor of
                    Minneapolis, Hubert Humphrey. We would have great evenings talking.</p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>In 1944, when I was not knowledgeable at that point about the CIO, Humphrey
                    merged the Farmer Labor Party with the Democratic Party so as to help Roosevelt
                    win in '44. They became the Democratic Farmer Labor Party. And Roosevelt won in
                    '44. In 1946 at the state convention Humphrey invited me to the convention. I
                    went to the convention - not as a delegate, but as an observer - the Communists
                    took over the DFL, a combined Democratic Former Labor Party. I can use the term
                    “communists” very easily because the following two or three years the CIO had
                    hearings and kicked out these people from the labor movement and I wrote my
                    doctoral dissertation on this question. So I was active, you see, politically at
                    the same time as I was teaching and writing a dissertation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the issue of communism as we move on - and McCarthyism
                        was getting strong; it started in, I guess, '49.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: It started afterwards.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How long were you at Minnesota?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: I left Minnesota in '48 and that in itself is interesting because it
                    fits in a little bit with what you're talking about. As I said, I was a good
                    teacher. The chairman of the department was a distinguished political scientist,
                    William Andersen. I had finished all of my coursework; my thesis subject was the
                    CIO versus the Communist Party, a Study in Power Politics. He came to me and he
                    said, “Max, you're doing well here, but we have a rule against giving permanent
                    faculty appointments to our students.” So he said, “I've got a suggestion to
                    make to you. We've talked it over in the department. Why don't you go someplace
                    else for two years, three years, and then come back to us?” I said, “Fine.” But
                    he said, “You've got to finish your dissertation.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I want to say you weren't married at this time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: No, I was not married at this time.</p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>So I said, “Fine.” He says, “I know just where you should go and I've arranged if
                    you want to, to go there,” and I said, “Where's that?” He said, “The London
                    School of Economics. It would be great for you to go there. They've got a
                    vacancy. You can stay there for two years and then you'll come back. Plus we'll
                    be getting you from the London School instead of from Minnesota.” So I wrote a
                    letter to London and they wrote a lovely letter back telling me where I was
                    going to be living and all the rest - the salary and living arrangements - and
                    then they said, “You know, one of our faculty people is in Chicago. Maybe you
                    ought to get acquainted with him. It's Harold Laski.” Well, I got the letter -
                    and is presented a problem. I had just published an article in the Journal of
                    Politics on Harold Laski, which was critical of his friendship with the
                    Soviets.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was a name to conjure with?He was very close to Eleanor
                        Roosevelt, wasn't he?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: Yes. He was a distinguished political scientist but he had this tilt
                    and I wrote about the tilt.</p>
                <p>How to handle this? So I wrote him a letter. I said, “I've just heard from
                    [so-and-so] that we're going to be colleagues next year and it might be a good
                    idea if we got acquainted. I'd be very pleased to come down on a Saturday to
                    Chicago and we can have a cup of tea together and get acquainted.” A nice
                    letter. “P.S. If you haven't yet read: Harold J. Laski, A Current Analysis by
                    Max M. Kampelman, which appears in the current issue of the Journal of Politics,
                    I suggest you not read it until after we meet.” I figured that's a way to handle
                    it. He got back to me and I went to Chicago on a Saturday and met with him and
                    his wife. He never raised the article anI didn't because I've already mentioned
                    it in the letter. About two weeks later I received a letter from the London
                    School of Economics saying they made a terrible mistake; they really don't have
                    a vacancy. So that took care of that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: So instead Bill Andersen tells me there's a vacancy in a college in
                    Vermont known as Bennington College. “Why don't you apply and I'll apply for
                    you.” So I got a letter back from the president in which he offered me a job and
                    a very nice letter in which he says I might object to some of the conditions and
                    one of these conditions is that we've got a two-and-a-half month vacation in the
                    summer and a two-and-a-half month vacation in the winter, and you may find that
                    to be too onerous; I was to teach two seminars. So, I got married that summer
                    and we went to Bennington College.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you tell me that you got married that summer?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: Yes.</p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you meet and what's the background of your
                        wife?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: I met Maggie during the war while attending a meeting of conscientious
                    objectors in New York. It was a meeting from different places and they were
                    meeting because some of the COs were not doing work that they thought was of
                    sufficient national importance and they wanted to do more of that kind of work.
                    A meeting was called for some of us to talk about what we were doing. I think I
                    was then in Maine and we had a meeting and one of the people who was there was
                    from a Philadelphia mental hospital; Ben Segal was his name. He is now dead. His
                    wife is today in a Quaker retirement home. He had a date with a friend, a former
                    classmate, and he introduced me to her, and it was Maggie. We became friends and
                    she kept in touch with me and indeed visited me in Minnesota. We finally decided
                    after a few years of knowing each other that we wanted to get married.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was her background?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: She was born in Chicago of a working class family, although her father
                    became a foreman at General Electric. She was a socialist. I don't know whether
                    she was a member of the Socialist Party or not, but she was a democratic
                    socialist and after college she got a job?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: She went where to college?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: She went to Chicago Roosevelt University. Have you heard of the
                    school?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, I've been there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: It used to be the central YMCA (Young Men's Christian
                    Association).</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well now it's located in the auditorium building, but then
                        it was in the YMCA.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: She was a good student, apparently an “A” student. In the beginning
                    she worked for the CIO war relief committee during the war and then got a job
                    with the Garment Workers Union, which was the union I also had worked for; and
                    she became an educational worker in Louisville, Kentucky, and then was
                    transferred to Wisconsin where she was the educational director of the union in
                    Wisconsin. She was able to come to Minnesota and it worked out very well. So we
                    got married and we went to Bennington College.</p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were at Bennington from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: It began September of '48.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And how long were you there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: Okay, that's a story now in and of itself which I have to give
                    you.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Alright.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: It was a great job. My weekends began on Thursday night and ended on
                    Tuesday morning. Two seminars on Tuesdays and Thursdays, but I had to finish my
                    doctoral dissertation.</p>
                <p>Humphrey in Minnesota was running for the Senate in November; I was in Vermont,
                    not voting in Minnesota, but he and I had become friends from these Saturday
                    night meetings anI helped out. As was mayor he asked me to do a few things on
                    the new city charter. We became friends. He called me on the phone after he won
                    the election. He said, “Max, Muriel and I are going to be in New York at a
                    meeting of the League for Industrial Democracy where I've been asked to make a
                    speech. Why don't you and Maggie meet us and spend the weekend with us?” So
                    Maggie and I drove down. I heard the speech and I met a lot of old friends
                    there; and then together we interviewed somebody for the job of running his
                    legislative program in Washington - a very capable man, I thought. I told
                    Humphrey afterwards, “You ought to take Stewart. He's really very, very good.” I
                    thought he did and I went back up to Vermont.</p>
                <p>Christmas came and I received another call from him. “I'm going to save you from
                    sin.” He had a real Protestant work ethic and five months vacation was for him
                    sinful. So he was going to save me from sin. He said, “Instead of playing around
                    waiting for two-and-a- half months I want you to help me open up my office and
                    get it together. Bill Simms is going to be there handling Minnesota problems;
                    he's not policy.” So, instead of finishing my dissertation, which I had time to
                    do, Maggie and I went to Washington. Frankly, I hired myself. I had a question
                    in my head, “How do you work for a friend?” But I quickly saw this was not a
                    problem. We were partners. I was his junior partner.</p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>So I got a hold of Fred Burkhardt, the president of Bennington, and I told him.
                    “Look,” he responded, “Max, come on up. Fly up for the opening of classes
                    because there are kids who have signed up for your classes already,” - two
                    seminars - “and meet with them. See what they want. See how you can work
                    something out maybe.” So I met with both classes and we worked out a deal. I
                    would come up I think it was every other weekend and have a three hour seminar
                    Friday night with one class and a three hour seminar Saturday morning with
                    another class. I don't think I did it every weekend, but I may have. Maybe it
                    was every other weekend. I gave the kids an opportunity to transfer to another
                    class, but they all wanted to continue with the class so this is what I did for
                    the rest of that term. As a matter of fact, as I talk to you now, Bennington was
                    then an all-girl school. I broke that mold because I told the girls, “Look, I
                    know I'm interfering with your weekend, but if you have dates and you want to
                    bring your date to the class, bring your date to the class.” And quite a few of
                    them would bring their dates to the class. So I then took a year's leave of
                    absence, thinking I would spend another year in Washington, and I stayed for
                    six-and-a-half years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By the way, for that time that you were going up to
                        Bennington we were about twenty miles apart. I was a junior at
                        Williams.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: The girls used to date the boys at Williams.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Unfortunately I kept trying to find a girlfriend up at
                        Bennington and I never really did, which you could've helped me if I had
                        only known.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: Well Maggie and I used to sometimes have dinner at the inn.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Williams Inn, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: Williams Inn, which was a beautiful place.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was a Treadway Inn.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Bennington had a reputation of being very avant garde all the time. How did you
                    find the students there?</p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: Really very good. Serious kids. A lot of dance and art, which I had
                    nothing to do with. But those who took political science courses were really
                    intelligent, bright kids. I'm trying to think; there's a school for slow
                    learners here in Washington run by Sally Smith. Do you know it? It's a great
                    school.</p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh yes. Is it something like Experiment School?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: I can't remember the name.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It has a name like that. It's located on Canal Road.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: She was one of my students. She's now running this school. A highly
                    motivated girl.</p>
                <p>So it was fine. What I found also, which was different from Minnesota and
                    impressed me - at Minnesota most of the talking was done by the boys; very few
                    girls said anything. They might come to you after class and talk to you. These
                    kids, with no boys around, they were talking. They participated. And that's why,
                    frankly, I recommended to two of my children that they go to an all-girl school,
                    Mt. Vernon College, and they loved it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This continues to be the case. There's a strong rationale
                        for having all-women colleges. It draws women to get out there and assert
                        leadership.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then we're moving back really to about '49, are we? We
                        moved to Washington. And it is for six years?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: Let me also add that during the '46 to '48 period with Humphrey we
                    lost the right wing of the Democratic Party lost to the left wing Farmer Labor
                    Party at the convention in '46. Between '46 and '48 Humphrey went around the
                    state with his friends to bring the party back from the left wing, which was
                    mostly the labor left wing, whereas right wing labor was on our side. And I
                    helped out - not much, but I did. He traveled all over the state. My classes
                    might finish, let's say, at three o'clock and he'd pick me up at three o'clock.
                    There would be a car full of people and we would drive someplace in the state
                    and meet with people who were on our side and tell them to organize. So I was
                    active in that. And, of course, without my being present in '48 he did take the
                    party.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it sort of what I call the traditional left wing,
                        particularly the communist thing of hanging on meetings until everybody went
                        home and then they would take over and that sort of thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: And this meant out organizing them. And they could organize well
                    because I remember the Electrical Workers Union and the Longshoremen's Union in
                    Duluth put a lot of money into that left wing and they hired organizers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These are the very left wing, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: But Humphrey was the popular political figure and he won the
                    convention. The only thing he got out of '46 is he got an agreement out of '46
                    to make his friend, Orville Freeman, as secretary of the party, which helped as
                    Orville Freeman later became secretary of agriculture and the governor of
                    Minnesota. He just died a few months ago.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Harold Stassen - was he in Minnesota?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: He was Minnesotan. A very active governor.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was Republican though, wasn't he?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was he a figure that sort of?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: He got involved in his politics and he was a major figure in the
                    state.</p>
                <p>Anyhow, I didn't want to get into that part of it.</p>
                <p>Now we're back to Washington.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're in '49 to '55 about, which was a very interesting
                        time. In the first place, tell me a little bit about Humphrey. I have a
                        great deal of admiration for Hubert Humphrey. He had a reputation that he
                        talked so much that it was hard to get a conversation going with him. How
                        did you find this? I mean he was just full of ideas.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: Full of ideas. And he did talk too long. I mean it is said, and I
                    believe it, whether it came from here or from somebody else, Hubert's speech
                    need not be eternal to be immortal.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [laughs]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: But his speeches were eternal. But you know, he was a great listener
                    as well as a great teacher. Believe me.</p>
                <p>I once talked to him about that. We became very close friends. I became his
                    lawyer. Until he died really we were intimate friends. But I once said to him,
                    “You know, everybody criticizes you for talking too goddamn long.” I said, “Why
                    do you talk so goddamn long?” This was early on. He says, “Max, you and I are
                    teachers.” He says, “When you really want to be a good teacher you've got to
                    tell them what you're going to tell them, and then you tell them, and then
                    you've got to tell them what you told them,” and that was his philosophy. And he
                    did look upon his politics as an educational teaching job. He was never

                <p>As a matter of fact, do you have a card?</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: Do you want some reading material on this period?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: Do you have my book?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, I don't have it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: Would you like a copy of my book?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: I just got some books from the Internet because it is out of print.
                    I'll send you one and I'll send you some reading material about Humphrey. They
                    just had the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Humphrey public affairs center at
                    the University of Minnesota. It was a reunion and they asked me to make the
                    banquet speech, which I did. I'll send it to you.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You arrive in Washington in 1949.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: January of '49.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Truman had surprisingly been reelected.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was your first time in Washington. What was the
                        flavor of the political situation and the things you were dealing with?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: Let me say first of all that I did not attend that great '48
                    convention where Humphrey made the civil rights speech because I was at
                    Bennington. I'm sorry I didn't go to Philadelphia for it, but I didn't. It
                    would've been a tremendous thing. But I've written up this period which I am
                    going to send you.</p>
                <p>The Southerners looked upon Humphrey as some terrible outsider, forcing the
                    Democratic Party to split.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was when Strom Thurmond and the Dixiecrats moved
                        in.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: Right. As you know, they left the Democratic Convention, walked out of
                    the convention. The Southerners looked upon Humphrey as some goddamn upstart.
                    (End of tape)</p>
                <p>Secondly, Time magazine had his picture on the cover as he came to Washington. It
                    was a picture of this whirlwind blowing into Washington like a tornado. If
                    you're a freshman senator you don't get that kind of recognition and as far as
                    Senators were concerned that was evil. Times were very, very tough and I
                    describe it in my speech and this article that I'll send you. It'll also
                    describe to you what we did, including what I did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well this is for the record here, so I think it's a good
                        idea to talk about some of the things that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: Okay. He's an enemy; they treat him like an enemy. There's no question
                    about it. And I think the word cruel is an accurate description of the
                    treatment. So what do you do?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You say “how they treated him.” How did this manifest
                        itself?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: Ignoring him; if he says anything they walk out of the chamber.</p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sort of in Coventry in a way.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: Yes. Now all these things hurt, particularly for a gregarious fellow
                    who never looks upon himself as having any enemies. He was a gregarious,
                    friendly human being. So what do we do about it? And I know this hurt him badly.
                    We would talk about it.</p>
                <p>He was offered the national chairmanship of Americans for Democratic Action
                    (ADA). ADA was an organization created between '46 and '48 to challenge the
                    Wallace movement within the Democratic Party. It was left wing. ADA was created
                    mostly by liberals. Eleanor Roosevelt was an active ingredient in that creation.
                    Humphrey was invited to be one of the leaders. Governor Chester Bowles of
                    Connecticut, Paul Douglas of Illinois, Ronald Reagan of California, president of
                    the Screen Actors Guild, were among the creators. And this was an organization
                    that was grabbing hold, with chapters in many states. And they asked Humphrey to
                    be the national chairman and I urged him to accept and he accepted it. I don't
                    think he even doubted it and he accepted it.</p>
                <p>He would get invitations to speak all over the country; he would accept those
                    invitations and he would build support all over the country. And slowly it began
                    to dawn mostly on the Democrats in the Senate, the non-Southern Democrats
                    because the Southern Democrats were a breed of their own; but the non-Southern
                    Democrats began to see he's carrying some politician weight. He's got support.
                    So it began to move them away from 'how do you get along in the Senate' to 'I
                    better think about my domestic constituency.' This began to evolve. This
                    developed friendships. Secondly, he worked like hell as a senator. Time was no
                    issue, day or night. He learned legislation. If an issue came up he knew what
                    the issue was. He was very bright. So he became knowledgeable about the issues
                    that were before the Senate and chose to speak about them, in spite of the fact
                    that the Southerners might walk out when he stood and spoke about them.</p>
                <p>We did one other thing. Let's assume that he'd make a speech on the Missouri
                    Valley Authority or soil conservation or labor legislation or poll tax or
                    getting rid of the civil rights discrimination. We learned - as a matter of
                    fact, I learned this - that that speech could be reprinted by the government
                    printing office and we could order as many copies as you want as long as you
                    paid for them, and it was relatively cheap. So since I had a lot of friends in
                    the trade union movement who became Humphrey friends and I was also in charge of
                    legislation in that office, Bill Simms, who was his assistant from there, was in
                    charge of Minnesota politics and I was in charge of legislation; I was in charge
                    of the press. Today my equivalent might be five, six, seven staff people. I was
                    the only one. I would persuade the labor unions or the education organizations
                    to order thousands of copies of these reprints and to distribute them around the
                    country.</p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>Many of the unions had educational meetings. I would frequently go and speak at
                    those educational meetings. The University of Wisconsin, for example, had a
                    School for Workers. All summer long unions would come for a week or ten days
                    with people from their staffs and from their members and we would be there with
                    literature and in person permeating ideas, sending out ideas - education for the
                    teachers, and the farmers, a lot of stuff like that and expect that they may be
                    informed, because these were thoughtful presentations and argumentative; they
                    weren't rhetoric as much as they were substance. And they gained support and
                    friends, and slowly Humphrey became the leader of the liberals in the Senate. He
                    was really acknowledged. Paul Douglas helped.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was from Illinois.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: Paul worshiped him. Paul became a dear friend. He helped him; he
                    guided him; he supported him. Even politicians who had played their political
                    life with the southern Democrats suddenly found they had to develop in other
                    directions as well. So we slowly began to overcome that negative.</p>
                <p>As far as the southerners were concerned, he was the enemy, with one exception:
                    Lyndon Johnson. He and Lyndon came to the Senate at the same time, but Lyndon
                    came from the House; but somehow, after about a year or two, they became
                    increasingly friendly. Humphrey wrote his master's thesis on Roosevelt's New
                    Deal. Johnson felt that his career was due to Roosevelt's help. Both were very
                    serious people. I don't mean to be negative about anybody, but if you were
                    looking for where Jack Kennedy was later on you'd have to look at the golf
                    course.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: Humphrey and Johnson worked day and night. They were serious people,
                    both of them. Johnson outworked everybody and Hubert had a good head and knew
                    his stuff; and that leads me to the following, which was crucial: Joe Pechman,
                    at the Brookings Institution, and I became very good friends. Joe was a tax
                    expert at the Brookings and he would always be filled with the inequities of tax
                    legislation and tax loopholes. And it occurred to me, and I went to Joe one day
                    and I said, “Joe, how would you like to help us out on these tax loopholes?” He
                    said yes. So I arranged a meeting with Humphrey. Pechman brought to the meeting
                    two or three other experts, one of whom I saw recently - Lou Oberdorfer - became
                    a federal judge here and had been a tax expert with one of the leading law
                    firms. Lou Oberdorfer, Joe Pechman, a fellow Charlie Davis, who was secretly
                    there because he was working for the House Ways and Means Committee, but he was
                    a tax expert. Joe used to say, “It's too technical.” So we talked and Humphrey
                    said, “You know, I'd like to do something about this in the Senate. Can you guys
                    help me?” and they said, “Yes, we'll help you.”</p>
                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>He persuaded them to help him, whereupon we began study sessions. At the end of a
                    workday they'd come to the office and they would make up a list of all the tax
                    loopholes that they thought we ought to try to close, knowing we couldn't do it,
                    but making a case for them. Each night we would discuss a different loophole.
                    We'd spend hours at it and it was complicated, but Humphrey was smart as hell
                    and he would catch it and then they would work and come up with papers. And we
                    finally came up, I think, with ten or eleven loopholes. Then I remember we had a
                    couple of evenings where they would shoot embarrassing technical questions at
                    Humphrey, the kind of questions you might get on the floor of the Senate. At the
                    end of it everybody was satisfied and we were ready to go because the tax bill
                    was coming up and that's what we were timing this for, the tax legislation.</p>
                <p>We arranged that one or two of them would - because they had jobs - be in the
                    gallery; I would sit next to Humphrey, which I mostly did when he was speaking;
                    and if things got tough I'd signal; they'd come down, I would go out, and they'd
                    give me the answer. Let me say to you that this rarely happened in a full week
                    of debate. Humphrey would begin introducing one amendment at a time. Opposition:
                    Walter George of Georgia, Dean of the Senate, and McKenna of Colorado, Senior
                    Republican - both aged, grey-haired people. And they knew the subject from A to
                    Z; they had been working on it for many years. As usual, a lot of the
                    southerners would move out of the chamber when Humphrey began. We began to see a
                    turn. He knew his stuff. Monday goes by, Tuesday goes by; Senators began to come
                    back in. It was a fascinating debate, lasting for hours each day. I can tell you
                    it was a wonderful thing to behold. I've never before or since seen it in the
                    Senate. The liberals were present - and they surround Humphrey as a way of
                    demonstrating support. Three or four or five of them became eight or nine, or
                    ten or twelve of them or fifteen of them were surrounding him. I remember
                    instance Bob Kerr of Oklahoma oil...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A big oil man.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: A big oil man, very conservative. An expert.</p>
                <p>The pending amendment is related to the depletion tax advantages for the oil
                    people get and we wanted to get rid of it. Herbert Lehman, an old man now,
                    wanted to help. So he had a brief statement to make, to let Humphrey catch his
                    breath, and he mispronounced “depreciation” to “depletiation.” Bob Kerr, a mean
                    man, stood up and ridiculed Lehman, a former lieutenant governor of his state, a
                    United States senator, a distinguished international banker. Humphrey heard this
                    and he gets up and he whiplashed Kerr as Humphrey can do with that tongue, and
                    he really brutalized Kerr, to the point of embarrassment; and then talked about
                    Lehman's public service career.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Herbert Lehman was governor of New York and a very
                        distinguished guy.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: A very distinguished man. And I'll tell you Humphrey just really wiped
                    the floor with Bob Kerr, as he has the capacity to do, which, let me tell you,
                    made him friends; made a lot of friends with Humphrey.</p>
                <p>Anyhow, the senators began coming back for this debate. Now we lost every single
                    amendment, as we expected to. At the end of the debate, it's over and Walter
                    George and Eugene Milliken come over to Humphrey - you've got to remember, he
                    had been ostracized by the Conservatives - shook his hand and embraced him for
                    the job he did. And that broke the dam. Humphrey began to cry. There were tears
                    coming out of his eyes. They respected him that day. That broke it. And I had
                    the interesting experience weeks later I had access to the Democratic cloakroom;
                    one staff person in each Senate office had access to use the telephone if we
                    needed to. The cloakroom was a place where Senators would lounge around; and I
                    heard Walter George, in his gruff voice, talking and it occurred to me they're
                    talking about Humphrey. And George was saying (they didn't know I was there),
                    “You know, that fellow Humphrey, he really means what he says about civil
                    rights.” Suddenly it occurred to me. These fellows couldn't believe that the
                    liberals believed in civil liberties. To them it was politics, getting the black
                    vote. They couldn't believe it. And let me tell you this had an impact on me.
                    Both sides had convictions. And that I saw in this event. The tax debate broke
                    the dam. Johnson also helped break the dam.</p>
                <p>One of the things I helped with early on was create a caucus of legislative
                    assistance, administrative assistants, among the liberals. A liberal caucus.
                    There never had been any such thing. But we figured these conservatives were
                    meeting together all the time?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Soon you were out having branch water and bourbon, I
                        guess.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: Exactly. So we met together with the assistants. Fortunately - I say
                    fortunately - Herbert Lehman was now in the Senate and whereas I was the only
                    legislative person in Humphrey's office, professionally, Lehman had a half a
                    dozen because he was using his own money.</p>

                <p>KAMPELMAN: And New York was a bigger state, which meant it got more money. He had
                    an administrative assistant by the name of Julius Edelstein, Commander Julius
                    Edelstein. He's still alive, still in New York, and I'm still in touch with him
                    regularly. He's now about ninety. So we used Julius' staff to do our work at the
                    caucus and we would work and get plans together so that we were becoming
                    increasingly effective in the Senate. We were increasingly effective. When
                    Johnson wanted to become the leader, he wanted to get it unanimously. He and
                    Humphrey used to spend time together because they were both serious people;
                    neither were society people; and their wives liked each other because their
                    wives were not society people. As a matter of fact, I was the liaison between
                    Humphrey and Johnson and when I left the Senate in 1955 the Washington Post had
                    a lead story in its political column by Albright, who was their political
                    reporter, saying, “What's going to happen to the Humphrey-Johnson alliance now
                    that Kampelman has left Humphrey?”</p>
                <p>I got along with Johnson quite well, and his staff. Johnson wanted unanimous
                    support as leader. The Democratic liberals couldn't do that because he was tied
                    in totally with his votes with the southern group. I knew he had relationships
                    with Franklin Roosevelt, and Humphrey saw a different side of him; we knew that
                    he was really a crass politician, but he had Texas to worry about. Anyhow, we
                    worked out a deal and the deal was that the liberals would choose James Murray
                    of Montana, an old man who by no means could be a leader, and they would
                    nominate Murray at the Democratic caucus. There would, therefore, be two
                    nominees, Murray and Johnson, and just before the vote Murray would stand up and
                    move to make it unanimous. So it was a unanimous vote for Johnson and yet a way
                    for us to express our independence.</p>

                        rights wise because this became a light motif later on. But this was early

                <p>***</p>
                <p>McCarthy. How did this hit you? I would think that you yourself might be
                    vulnerable coming out of the New York area and having been a conscientious
                    objector and all. It's the sort of thing that I would think the McCarthyites
                    might zero in on. Did they give you any trouble?</p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: I did not experience that problem in any way. Actually, McCarthy came
                    from Wisconsin, next door neighbor to Minnesota. I had the occasion when he
                    first came to the Senate to talk to him and I never found him hostile,
                    personally. I found him forthcoming. In McCarthy's early days he made a great
                    effort to work with the press. He had goof rapport with the press. As a matter
                    of fact, there was a man by the name of Lee Nichols who was the United Press
                    correspondent in Washington at the time, who had worked at the C.O. Journal with
                    me during the war. Lee Nichols was a friend of McCarthy, at least socially. That
                    said, McCarthy spent time socially with Lee Nichols. So I did not personally
                    experience any difficulty. Of course, he became really such an irresponsible
                    public servant with his mindless attacks. He was considered in my mind and in
                    the mind of Humphrey and others, to be an irresponsible opportunist with an evil
                    streak in him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did Humphrey relate during this time to McCarthy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: They had a working relationship but not a friendship.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a point where McCarthy had gone too far and he
                        was getting shunned? I mean early attacks and all of this.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: Well, Humphrey was never attacked, if that's your question. Oh yes,
                    McCarthy became an opportunist and he decided this was his future and he became
                    totally irresponsible.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But was there any concern about a McCarthy movement as far
                        as the political process?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: We did not find a problem, to the best of my recollection, in
                    Minnesota, but Humphrey's goal was to disassociate his anti-communist
                    convictions from McCarthy, who he believe to be a real danger to our democratic
                    society. Bill Benton, the Senator from Connecticut, a Democrat, a very, very
                    wealthy man took on.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: Bill Benton was an ADA member - Americans for Democratic Action - and
                    we would talk about this McCarthy problem in the caucus that we had begun to
                    formulate in the Senate, a liberal caucus. Benton announced that he would take
                    on the anti-McCarthy effort. He would urge Humphrey and others not to get
                    involved deeply. I remember him vividly saying, “If we're going to get tarred, I
                    can handle it. I'll just go after him. I'm not afraid of what he can do to me in
                    Connecticut.” So he took the lead in the Senate when it was called the
                    anti-McCarthy movement in the Senate. In the meantime there was tremendous
                    irritation growing around the country and among the Democrats in general.
                    Humphrey particularly was terribly troubled by McCarthy. He had, after all, come
                    into national politics by being the anti-communist liberal. He understood the
                    communists and their totalitarian ideology give his experience with the
                    Democratic Labor Party in Minnesota. Americans for Democratic Action was created
                    for the anti-communist labor movement; he felt McCarthy was a phony. One night
                    Humphrey had dinner with an old professor of his and of mine, a man by the name
                    of Benjamin Lippincott, a political science professor at the University of
                    Minnesota. I knew they were having dinner that night. The next morning Humphrey
                    said, “You know, I had dinner with Ben last night.” I said, “I know.” And he
                    said, “We came up with a damn good idea, that we introduce some legislation,”
                    basing it on a judicial opinion bJudge Learned Hand of the United States Court
                    of Appeals for the Second Circuit in New York, one of the country's outstanding
                    judges who should have been on the Supreme Court. There were two brothers, if
                    you remember, at the same time serving on the same court. They would say one of
                    them was the Learned Judges August Hand and the other was the August Judge
                    Learned Hand.</p>
                <p>The decision by Judge Hand had to do with communist activity. In his opinion, he
                    did not look upon the Communist Party as a political party. He looked upon them
                    as an arm of the Soviet Union and that, therefore, it should not be treated like
                    a political party seeking to win public office. We both looked upon Lippincott
                    as a professor. So Humphrey said to me, “Let's file a bill consisted with the
                    Judge Hand opinion. We know how to deal with communists. I'd like you to come up
                    with something. Think about it.” So I did.</p>
                <p>I got in touch with a man who was then the general counsel of the AFL-CIO. His
                    name was Arthur Goldberg who later became a Supreme Court Justice. The CIO had
                    taken upon itself to have trials against unions considered to be communist
                    unions. They brought charges against the leadership of those unions - the
                    electrical workers, the longshoremen, and others. There were a few of those
                    unions, as a matter of fact, within the CIO. They didn't have a lot of members
                    but they had a lot of activity. Arthur was the lawyer who brought Philip Murray,
                    the head of the CIO, and Walter Reuther, of the automobile workers together
                    cleansed the labor movement of communist influence. I talked to Arthur about
                    legislation and Arthur assigned one of his deputies, a man by the name of
                    Harris, to work with me. We developed a piece of legislation which in effect
                    said that the communist party was not a political party, but an arm of the
                    Soviet Union and that it should be treated as such. If you call a person a
                    communist you are accusing him of a crime. If the accusation cannot be proven,
                    you're subject to a lawsuit for unjustifiably accusing somebody of being a
                    criminal.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So people would almost have to register because they
                        were...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: That's right. So we wrote up a piece of legislation, gave it to
                    Humphrey, and he liked it; we shared it with Senator Wayne Morse, a senator from
                    Oregon and a leading legal scholar.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was he a Republican or a Democrat at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: A republican who was drifting from the Republican Party to be an
                    independent. Q: But he at that time was a republican.</p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: At that time he was in the course of the shift. But he shifted from
                    the Republicans to be independent. He had been a professor of constitutional
                    law, a very learned lawyer, and he looked at the legislation and he liked it; he
                    made a few changes in it and he said, “I'll be glad to introduce it at the
                    Senate.” So we got together with Paul Douglas, Herbert Lehman, and introduced
                    the legislation. If we really wanted to challenge the communists, you just don't
                    go and change liberals while being communists. If you called somebody a
                    communist who was not a communist he could sue you for defamation of character
                    based on the decision by Judge Hand and the legislation. The legislation did not
                    become law.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This straddles the two periods, but let's talk about 1950
                        when Truman was president and Humphrey was a senator and you were assistant,
                        about the Korean War. This was June 25, 1950. How did Humphrey react to
                        this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: Let me say - and I've written about this - that when Humphrey came to
                    the Senate he was cruelly treated. I don't know if I went into that with
                    you.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You did.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: Truman was among those who thought negatively about Humphrey. The
                    reason for that was that the south walked out of the democratic convention
                    because of what Humphrey did on the civil rights program, and Truman at the time
                    thought that it might've assured his defeat, but he won and in the next year he
                    began seeing Humphrey moving in as a leader and supporting Truman's policies.
                    With time, by the second year - I would say by 1950 - they were pretty close. I
                    think it was in 1951. We were always looking ahead to the next election in 1954.
                    We looked at the state and there was a very popular Republican governor by the
                    name of Luther Youngdahl, who was a good public servant and a nice decent man.
                    As a matter of fact, I had voted for him when I was in Minnesota, even though I
                    was a Democrat. Humphrey and I talked about him as an effective policing
                    opponent in 1954. We knew he was a lawyer.</p>
                <p>One morning we saw in the newspaper, in the Washington Post, that a federal judge
                    here in Washington resigned. I called Humphrey on the phone early before I got
                    to the office and he said, “You thinking what I'm thinking?” and I said, “Yes.”
                    So Humphrey arranged to see Truman and explain to Truman that Youngdahl was a
                    fine and capable public servant, would be a great judge, and his appointment to
                    the new vacancy would be politically desirable. Truman's reaction was, “No. He
                    defended me when it came to MacArthur.” He agreed. We then had to tell the
                    governor what we had in mind. Another friend did that. He became an outstanding
                    judge. This was an indication of Truman's friendship with Humphrey. They were
                    both the same kind of Democrats: strong defense, military stability and very
                    liberal on domestic policy.</p>

                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: At that time, the Korean War was by no means explosive and a divisive
                    force like the Vietnam War. This war was to protect against an invasion by North
                    Koreans. My recollection is that it was simply not very divisive. The
                    divisiveness developed later when Truman fired MacArthur because MacArthur in
                    effect challenged his judgment and went further than Truman wanted him to go,
                    toward the Yellow River, if I recall correctly.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These were the great southern barons, weren't they, who
                        headed the committees?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: The Senate of the United States was controlled by the Southerners.
                    They were the Democrats with seniority and they had an alliance with the
                    conservative Republicans. All the committee chairs were from the South. They had
                    seniority. They were there like fixtures. They were heavy with seniority and
                    they had power.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As you were drawing up these things what was your feeling?
                        Was this like spitting into a hurricane or were you looking to the
                        future?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: Again, I've written on this. Humphrey was ostracized. It hurt him. By
                    that I mean he felt personally hurt because he was a gregarious fellow. Some of
                    his best personal friends had been opponents. That never was a factor with him
                    and he was gracious. But we talked about this and I knew he was deeply hurt. He
                    was offered the ADA national chairmanship and he accepted it. We worked out a
                    strategy under which, as national chairman he would travel around the country
                    with a good staff of ADA people. The national office was in Washington; the man
                    in charge of ADA was Jim Loeb, a good organizer, and we arranged for Humphrey to
                    speak all over the country for ADA, which meant for liberals and for labor
                    because the AFL-CIO leaders associated themselves with ADA. He had large
                    audiences - I don't know if you've ever heard him speak, but the man was an
                    eloquent speaker, one of the best speakers in the country and he could get a
                    group excited. Normally the purpose was to build up ADA and Humphrey support in
                    the states and that support could pressure Washington. Slowly during the course
                    of that year and the second year and that time democrats out of the South, not
                    in the South, were beginning to recognize that Humphrey had a constituency in
                    their state. For example, I remember that the Senators from Pennsylvania were
                    not friendly at all; Scott Lucas of Illinois was not friendly at all. But within
                    Pennsylvania the unions were there and our liberals were there; within Illinois
                    the same thing. So they began to pay attention to Humphrey and he was by the
                    second year being recognized as being the liberal leader in the Senate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had there been anybody playing that role before?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: The liberals were not organized before. I helped organize, for
                    example, the legislative assistants of the liberals and we met regularly. We met
                    once a week back then. I guess by 1952 we were meeting once a week or more often
                    if necessary. Herbert Lehman joined and helped.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of New York.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: Of New York. A very, very wealthy man who hired staff above what the
                    Senate budget provided. We were limited by the Senate budget. We had no money. I
                    was the only one in our whole office that dealt with legislation and the press.
                    I think Lehman perhaps had eighteen people. So our caucus used the Lehman office
                    really to do a lot of the paperwork. We had one other device, that I came up
                    with, and it worked out beautifully. I learned early on that a Senator or a
                    House member could order reprints of sections of the Congressional Record. They
                    had to pay for it but the cost was not that great because it was the government
                    printing office. So in introducing anti- lynching legislation he didn't just
                    introduce the legislation; he made a statement speech why the legislation was
                    essential. He would go into history of lynching and news events. We would widely
                    distribute the reprint,</p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>A proposal to create a Missouri Valley Authority, a movement to move the
                    principles of the Tennessee Valley Authority to the Missouri Valley was a goal.
                    Legislation was not just introduced, support for it, a statement, of course,
                    followed. We persuaded our friends, to order the reprints. And we reprinted
                    thousands of them - it was in the many thousands; I no longer remember the
                    numbers - and we sent them to every chapter of ADA in the country. I had taught
                    worker's education at the University of Wisconsin. There was a school for
                    working students at the University of Wisconsin - it still is there - and for
                    two summers I taught there. Unions were developing educational programs all over
                    the country. Again, we loaded them with literature. So our job was to educate at
                    the same time as we put in legislation. And let me tell you, that began to be
                    useful and crucial and produce results. So we countered the isolation we
                    experienced in the second year by developing friends around the country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, in a way the stoppage of these civilized things in
                        the Senate committees didn't produce anything. I mean it was just a matter
                        of sitting on it so that all the talk and explanation was coming out of your
                        side.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: That's right. A crucial ingredient later developed with Lyndon
                    Johnson. Johnson came from the House to the Senate in the same year as Humphrey
                    joined. Somehow Johnson was the first of the Southerners to begin responding to
                    Humphrey. Humphrey wrote his master's thesis on Roosevelt and the New Deal.
                    Johnson felt that his political career was advanced by Roosevelt. So they had
                    that in common. Neither of them would ever dream of taking an afternoon off to
                    play golf. These were two serious legislators. Their wives were not social
                    butterflies. There wives were down to earth ladies and they liked each
                    other.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is Muriel and Lady Bird.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: Muriel and Lady Bird. Not that they spent a lot of time with each
                    other, began to see Humphrey as a possible contributor to his advancement. That
                    may have been his motives.</p>
                <p>Humphrey's motives were that he saw talent and he saw an opportunity to break the
                    Southern alienation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Humphrey bitten at all, during the time you were
                        there, by the presidential bug?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: I think so, but I have to tell you so were his friends while he was
                    mayor. I was there when he was mayor. In 1952, before Stevenson was selected
                    Senator, Brian McMahon of Connecticut made an appointment to bring in John
                    Bailey, the political boss of Connecticut, to see Humphrey. I was present. Why
                    did they want to see Humphrey? They don't like Stevenson; they don't think
                    Harriman knows how to campaign, and Bailey has decided he would like to have
                    Humphrey be the candidate for president in 1952.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Bailey, of course, was like Farley. He was one of the
                        national bosses. He was a very powerful figure.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: His point was, “Hubert, we can get you the nomination.” I remember
                    this. Humphrey's response was that he had already committed himself to
                    Stevenson. He said he was not ready for the presidency and that they should go
                    and support Stevenson. He knew that Truman was for Stevenson. We publicly read
                    that Truman would prefer Stevenson over Harriman. So the presidential bug was
                    somehow in the wind even in 1952.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You say part of your responsibility was the press. Can you
                        talk about the press during that period of time? It was the fourth arm of
                        government or something like that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: Humphrey was extremely popular with members of the press. He was
                    always available and helpful. They began to accept the fact that he was moving.
                    Their job was to stay in the Senate gallery and hear speeches. Well, what they
                    heard were educational performances. As I explained to you, because our
                    objective was not the immediate vote alone. Our objective was to come up with
                    some educational materials that we could distribute around the country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Prepare the ground.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: Prepare the groundwork and begin educating the public, and we did a
                    lot of that with speakers. The reactions of the press were very good and that,
                    of course, further irritated the South because he was then getting very good
                    press around the country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In '55 you left. This was after Humphrey ran again in '54
                        and was reelected. Why did you leave?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: Because I never intended to stay that long. This was not to be my
                    career. It was very clear that I had a teaching job waiting for me in Vermont
                    and now Minnesota was beginning to say, “Come back to us.” So this was never my
                    life and I never intended to be here for the rest of my life. As a matter of
                    fact, the night of the '54 election victory I told Humphrey that it was getting
                    to be time for me to leave, I congratulated him, and I said, “Hubert, I really
                    should leave now.” He said, “What are you going to do?” I said, “Frankly, I
                    don't know. I haven't had time even to plan what I was going to do.” I had the
                    whole legislative burden on my shoulders; it was a hard, tough job. And we
                    wanted a family. Well, he says, “Who's going to take your place?” I said, “I
                    don't know. We're going to have to find somebody.” And he said, “Look, stay for
                    the next session. It's now November, the next session is January. Stay for the
                    next session. Find a replacement for yourself during the next session. Begin
                    making some plans for yourself. Just don't go off leaving without knowing what
                    you're going to do.” So I agreed and I waited until the end, which was
                    September, October of '55, and I got a replacement.</p>
                <p>Tom Hughes was from Mankato, Minnesota. He was a graduate of the Yale Law School.
                    I had met him when Humphrey became chairman of a subcommittee and I asked Tom
                    Hughes if he wanted to come down and serve as the counsel for that session. I
                    liked and respected him and Humphrey got to know him. I had my replacement. Tom
                    Hughes after a year left Humphrey because somebody he felt closer to, Chester
                    Bowles, had gone to the House and Chester asked him to be his top man, so he
                    went with Chester Bowles. But that didn't matter.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I've had a nice long interview with Tom Hughes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: So you know Tom.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: He did the job very well. As a matter of fact, I had lunch with Tom
                    the other day. In the meantime Maggie and I made a decision not to leave
                    Washington. We had friends now and frankly I wanted to help Humphrey become
                    President. I did not see how I could do that from Vermont, or even Minnesota. I
                    decided, since I had always intended and indeed was a lawyer, that I would open
                    a law office. I found some space at 17th and K, a brand-new building. I hoped to
                    get business from law firms in New York and Minnesota who knew me.</p>
                <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                <p>Humphrey was also chairman of a subcommittee on security. This was a subcommittee
                    of the governmental affairs committee and involved government security, loyalty
                    tests and all of that. They needed a special counsel for that and friends of
                    mine recommended a man by the name of Harold Green, who was working for the
                    Atomic Energy Commission (AEC). I met Green, I was impressed with him, I
                    introduced him to Humphrey and for about a year he did a hell of a good job. He
                    came out with good studies and good recommendations which were well-received and
                    were fully consistent with civil liberties. Hal was a good lawyer. Hal said to
                    me, “I hear you're leaving to practice law.” I said, “Yes.” And he said, “Well,
                    I don't want to go back to the Atomic Energy Commission. I want to open up my
                    law office and work in the security field. What if we do it together?” I said,
                    “Well, I don't want a partner,” but I said, “we can share space.” So that's what
                    happened and we shared space.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So how long were you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: Well, while we're on that theme, let me go earlier. Early in my Senate
                    career in 1949 and '50, I met a lawyer by the name of Felix Cohen. He had been
                    the Solicitor of the Department of the Interior under Harold Ickeys. He was the
                    son of a great American philosopher, Morris Raphael Cohen, who was an associated
                    of John Dewey. Felix was a philosopher in his own right, as well as a superb
                    lawyer. He had created a new Interior Department, the Indian Claims Settlement
                    Commission. There had been tremendous grievances, correct grievances, about how
                    the American Indians had been treated and Harold Ickeys had wanted to respond.
                    He needed Felix to draw up a piece of legislation under which this commission
                    would be established. Indian tribes who felt or believed land had been taken
                    from them, either without compensation or without adequate compensation, could
                    come to this commission and present their claims. If their claims were upheld
                    then another hearing took place where a dollar amount for compensation would be
                    established. By the time I met him, Felix was practicing law. Among his clients
                    was the American Association of Indian Affairs. He was an expert advisor to
                    Indian tribes in Minnesota and all over the country.</p>
                <p>We had once briefly met in Washington during my law school days when he helped
                    some of us in the law schools, in the anti-communist group at a convention here
                    in Washington. Felix became a friend of mine with my move to Washington; I
                    admired him. Let me say to you his wife is still alive. I think my wife saw her
                    last month. I think she's in her nineties. She's in bad shape, but her mind is
                    still lucid. We became friends. This leads to our subject.</p>
                <p>Felix had two associates working for him. It was a small firm. One was a young
                    man by the name of Arthur Lazarus, from Yale law school. It turned out that when
                    I had been much younger I had dated his sister. Another young lawyer with Felix
                    was Richard Schifter who also came to me with a letter from Chester Bowles to
                    Humphrey and another from a mutual friend to me. We became friends. So I not
                    only knew Felix but also two people working for him.</p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>When I announced that I was leaving the Senate, incidentally, Robert Albright of
                    the Washington Post, a political reporter, wrote a story on what's going to
                    happen to the Humphrey-Johnson alliance now that Kampelman is leaving. I played
                    a crucial role in that relationship.</p>
                <p>Anyhow, with my decision to leave the Senate, Richard Schifter and Arthur Lazarus
                    came to me. Felix Cohen had died about six months earlier. He smoked like a
                    chimney. They wanted me to come to join them. They and Felix in Washington were
                    part of a large firm in New York, which was looking for a partner to replace
                    Felix. The firm was dealing with Mr. “X,” who was a retired diplomat and a very
                    successful society lawyer; and they didn't like Mr. “X.” Would I consider
                    joining the firm? I said, “No. I don't want to join people I don't even know in
                    New York.”</p>
                <p>We were invited one night for dinner at the Schifter's, which was not unusual;
                    present was one of the partners from the New York office, and a man by the name
                    of Frank - he died last year - we got into a warm argument. I can't even
                    remember why we had an argument, but he was an argumentative fellow. It was on
                    some public issue and we were on opposite sides. As soon as I left that I
                    remember telling my wife, “There goes the Schifter dream.” But they offered me
                    the partnership. I hesitated. So we worked out a middle deal. They would move
                    their offices, which were on 18th Street, to my new office building on K Street
                    where there was space on the same floor; they would have an entrance to their
                    office and I would have an entrance to mine. There would be an in between
                    partition with a door in it; and we'd try this out for a year and see how we
                    felt about it. Well I can tell you that in the course of the first week I needed
                    them because I couldn't have been in two places at the same time. It became
                    clear to me I needed help, so we became one.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What type of law were you getting into?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: Anything that would come my way, except lobbying. I had made up my
                    mind that I would never lobby. The reason I had made up my mind on lobbying was
                    because I had seen distinguished lawyers come to me on behalf of a client. They
                    were supplicants, you know, and I did not want that. I just felt it was not
                    dignified. As I explained, we made one exception, Arthur and Dick would continue
                    to lobby for Indian tribes. I explained that when I walk down the Senate halls I
                    wanted a senator or congressman to say, “Max, where have you been? I haven't
                    seen you in a long time,” rather than think, “What does he want this time?”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But did you find yourself called upon to, say, rather than
                        representing a client they say, “Max, we're working on some legislation to
                        promote [this or that].”?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: I had two or three early opportunities. The Senate Secretary was a man
                    by the name of Leslie Biffle, who really ran the Senate machinery. A Southerner,
                    he respected me and tried to help me. He called soon after I opened my office
                    and said, “I've asked Mr. [So-and-so] to come to see you. I think this could be
                    a good thing.” The new opportunity represented the National Tax Equality
                    Association. It was an association designed to eliminate the privileges that
                    farmer cooperatives have in the tax codes, special tax breaks.” He explained to
                    me what he wanted. So I said to him, “Look, we've got a lot of cooperatives in
                    the Senate.” I want to help them. He wanted me to go to Humphrey because I had
                    access to Humphrey, in order to do something that was against his principles and
                    against his politics. So I said no. I got another call from Leslie Biffle, “I've
                    asked [so-and-so] to come to see you for help.” This man wanted me to represent
                    the government of the Dominican Republic, headed by Mr. Trujillo a dictator. I
                    refused.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was one of the most corrupt, brutal dictators.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: So I said I can't represent Trujillo. I said that goes against
                    everything I believe in. He's a dictator. I called Leslie Biffle and thanked
                    him. In a few days, I had a lawyer in Minneapolis ask me to do something at the
                    Securities and Exchange Commission. I had another matter coming up with a lady,
                    who was recommended to me by a friend, who wanted a divorce. It happened quickly
                    that I needed Arthur Lazarus to cover for me. I couldn't be in two places at the
                    same time. Arthur and Dick were superb lawyers. We continued to handle any
                    business that came in: Real estate; a divorce; the Securities and Exchange
                    Commission; we did it. I will say this to you: we did it well in the sense that
                    I had two great Yale law school lawyers, both of whom at been at the top of
                    their class, and we received referrals.</p>
                <p>The divorce, for example, was in behalf of a young lady who was married to the
                    son of one of the very wealthy families in Washington. He had been violent. His
                    mother had four law firms representing the husband at different times and I was
                    the only one representing the wife. The company lawyer - the mother helped the
                    son, the father was dead; the mother, with her husband, brought in the company
                    lawyer, brought in her personal lawyer, brought in the head of the D.C. Bar
                    Association because she thought he would have influence with the judges. I told
                    my secretary, “You keep time records, but I want you to have another column
                    called 'aggravation time' because they're going to pay for this aggravation
                    time.” And they did. I won the divorce for our and I got a hell of a fee from
                    the mother. I ended up introducing my client to her next husband who was a
                    professor of political science.</p>
                <pb facs="0060" n="Page0060"/>
                <p>I created the first new bank in Washington in forty years. One of my clients was
                    in the real estate business, a dentist; he was my dentist and developed an
                    expertise in real estate. I learned, working with him and representing him and
                    seeing things, to work with the banks. In the older banks in Washington - there
                    were a few of them only - not a single black was on the board of directors; not
                    a single woman was on the board of directors; not a single Jew was on the board
                    of directors. I remember talking to my client about this; I said, “This is
                    ridiculous. When Kennedy got elected in 1960 I knew he'd come in with a new
                    administration. So I said to my dentist - client, “How would you like to join me
                    in creating a bank?” They'll be a new control of the currency. I did some
                    research on it. There's been no new bank in forty years. Can we get enough
                    wealthy people together so that we have financial substance here? Well, my
                    client was an entrepreneur and he liked the idea. So we got the group of
                    investors together.</p>
                <p>I asked the President of the Howard University, whom I had known, Jim Nabrit, if
                    he would be willing to serve on the board; and he said yes. I then asked
                    Patricia Roberts Harris, the dean of the law school who later became our
                    ambassador to Luxembourg, if she would join the board of that company, and she
                    agreed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: She's an African-American.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: An African-American woman. I then asked a man whom I met when I was in
                    the Senate; he was a Marine Corps colonel by the name of Don Hittle, and he
                    became a good friend of mine. As a matter of fact, when I used to lecture around
                    the classes I would say, “The most effective lobbyist I've met in my experience
                    happens to be a Marine Corps colonel. He represents the Marine Corps.” And it's
                    true. He was very effective. Smart. I liked him and we became good friends. He
                    was now retired and I asked him if he wanted to be on the board. We really put
                    together a good composite. The comptroller was impressed and he gave us the new
                    bank charter.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the name of the bank?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: It was then called the District of Columbia National Bank. I became
                    chairman of the executive committee and our Firm served as counsel. But I'm not
                    a banker and I knew I wasn't a banker and after a couple of years, a businessman
                    in Washington came to see me - he owneSavings and Loan Association ; I remember
                    that - and he said, “I'd like to buy your bank. You'll all make a lot of money.
                    I'll pay you a great deal.” So I talked it over with my dentist friend and the
                    board and they all said if the price is good, sure, we'll sell; we're not
                    bankers. We sold and we all made good money. I'll go on to say that today it is
                    the owned by the Bank of America.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ah-ha.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: The Bank of America was the last purchaser of the bank.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is there any relation to American Security and Trust?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: No. American Security and Trust - a man by the name of Baker was the
                    president of it - helped us in our getting the charter, which was strange. Riggs
                    was the largest bank in town and tried hard to stop us.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In '55 you left the Senate step. How long were you a
                        lawyer before you got back sort of into government work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: Well, I practiced law beginning with 1955 until 1980. During that time
                    I never sought a government job. I really never expected I'd want to go back to
                    working for the government again. I'd seen the government closely from the
                    Senate. As you know, Humphrey was active; I knew the government agencies; I knew
                    the White House; I knew people there. I did have two career opportunities to be
                    a federal judge. The first was a call from the White House - Mike Feldman was
                    then counsel for Kennedy. He said, “Hubert just left the president and he was
                    recommending somebody for a judgeship? After you left the President asked, 'Why
                    doesn't Hubert ever come over here with Max's name?” So I said, “He never comes
                    in with my name because I've never asked him to come in with my name. That's not
                    what I want.” So he says, “Just keep in mind, Max, the president likes you? If
                    you ever want something or a judgeship, just don't hesitate to ask.”</p>
                <p>The next opportunity was a call from Humphrey at about 10:30 in the morning. He
                    had just left President Johnson who intended to appoint me to be a judge in the
                    United States Court Claims. In a year, there is going to be a vacancy in the
                    United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, and I would be
                    moved from the Court of Claims to the Court of Appeals. “The rest is up to you.
                    Do you want it? I've got to know by two o'clock.” So I said I would think about
                    it for an hour and I'll call him back. I thought about it for an hour and I
                    called him back and said no. And that was a definitive no.</p>
                <p>There was one other event that I shouldn't forget because it was a job offer. On
                    the day of Kennedy's funeral in Washington, Humphrey called me in the afternoon,
                    “Can you and Maggie come out and have dinner with Muriel and me tonight?” and I
                    said, “Yes.” I knew he was terribly crushed by Kennedy's assassination. He and
                    Kennedy had become very close friends in contrast with their 1960 race when they
                    were political rivalries. I knew the assassination was troubling him terribly.
                    And I thought that's what he wanted to talk about.</p>
                <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                <p>Adlai Stevenson was also at the dinner, but he left for the airport. We were
                    washing the dishes when Humphrey said: “I was with the president this
                    afternoon,” He wants you to be his counsel. He does not want Sorenson. He wants
                    you in there.” My wife, hearing this, exclaimed: “Hubert, you can't do this to
                    Max.” I talked to Humphrey. I explained to him why I had no interest in it at
                    all. I had spent a lot of time with Johnson in the Senate; he knew no restraint;
                    I knew his weaknesses; nothing in the Cato book surprised me. I found that he
                    enslaved his staff. George Reedy, who was a good friend of mine who worked for
                    the United Press before Johnson hired him, was a neighbor who lived right across
                    the street from us, and I knew how badly he treated George.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was his press spokesman, I guess.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: Yes. Lillian, who was George's wife, would complain to Maggie
                    frequently about Johnson's treatment of his staff. Respect for me would go out
                    the window. One Sunday, Reedy woke up and found a brand-new Lincoln in front of
                    his house, a gift from the president. Obviously the president felt guilty about
                    some event and gave him a Lincoln. Humphrey understood this. I also explained to
                    him; “Look Hubert, we have a President; we don't have a Vice President. Under
                    the Constitution we need a vice president and he's going to have to run for
                    president in November with a vice president. Now I think what I ought to be
                    doing is looking to make certain that you run the vice presidential candidate.”
                    And I said to him, and this was, of course, only two days after the
                    assassination; “I can't back you and work for Johnson. Johnson wouldn't want me.
                    Secondly, if I worked for him and didn't help you to become vice president, he
                    wouldn't believe me. He'd think I was anyhow.” So I said, “Just try to get it
                    out of consideration. Say no.” I saw Johnson about two weeks later at a bill
                    signing and. And Johnson said to me, “I've got to talk to you.” I said, “Yes,
                    Mr. President?” and left it at that and he didn't call.</p>
                <p>There was one other sad and awful experience for me. Johnson was President and I
                    received a phone call: “The president would like to see you.” No reason given. I
                    was taken to a crowded room. The President was going to announce the appointment
                    of a new Mayor for the District of Columbia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Walter Washington.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: Yes. Walter Washington was to replace the old commission form of
                    government and I was apparently to be appointed the chairman of the city
                    counsel.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No consultation.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: No consultation in the slightest. Ramsey Clark is there, the attorney
                    general at the time. I said to him, “This can't be. I'm not going to leave my
                    law office.” “Max, we checked the law on this. You don't have to worry about
                    conflict of interest, nothing.” Well, I said, “Okay.” If I don't have to break
                    the law, it's a public service and I'd be glad to do it. The president came out
                    and made the public announcement. I went back to the office, I called my
                    partners together, and told them exactly what happened. And I remember turning
                    to Harold Greene saying, “Hal, please, let's get the conflict issue resolved.
                    Call the attorney general's office and see what they have on the question and do
                    the research yourself.” About four or five days later he said, “Max, you can't
                    do both jobs. Unless you work for the Government less than 129 days a year.
                    That's the law.” I said, “you can't be chairman of the City Counsel for 129
                    instead of 365 days.”</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, and this is where the bitterness comes in for me, Clark Mohlenoff, a
                    reporter for the Minneapolis and the Des Moines newspapers, is close to a
                    Congressman from Ohio, or from another state, a right-wing extremist, Clark was
                    very hostile to Humphrey, as was this congressman. Humphrey was not yet vice
                    president; it was barely an idea.</p>
                <p>He was investigating a client of mine who helped put up a truck factory in India
                    with government aid help. I had developed and helped persuade my client to do
                    so. He was a good client, a close client, a Minneapolis client. His company
                    bought a Detroit motor truck company and they were looking what to do with it
                    overseas; and I had a theory, which I've had for a long time before. With the
                    technical developments in the United States, a great deal of very good equipment
                    would be destroyed as they were replacing it. Why not just give that equipment
                    to underdeveloped countries and help them develop. My client liked the idea and
                    he proposed a deal with business interests in India. AID (Agency for
                    International Development) was to provide assistance. Clark Mohlenoff and his
                    Iowa Congressman began describing the project as corrupt - saying that Humphrey
                    is making deals under which a supporter of his was getting money from AID to
                    send junk overseas. This was the theme. And I was representing that client,
                    although I never approached AID; the company did that on its own. The client was
                    well-equipped; he didn't need me to do that. Nor was Humphrey involved even
                    though it would have been proper for either or both of us to be involved in the
                    AID decision to support.</p>
                <p>In the meantime I'm being told by my office that I can't take the city job.
                    Dilemma: what do I do? I went to the attorney general. I gave him our legal
                    memorandum. The law was clear. I can't be in the firm if I gave more than 129
                    days for the city. I discussed this with Allen Bible who was then the chairman
                    of the Senate District Committee from Nevada, and a good friend of mine; I'd
                    worked with him; and I needed it all out in the open. I said, “Allen, I'm
                    looking at withdrawing my name from consideration as Chairman of the City
                    Counsel.” I was the largest producer in the firm. I did. He came back with an
                    idea. He said, “Give me a thoroughly detailed statement and I'll put it in the
                    Congressional Record.” Which I did.</p>
                <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                <p>The Washington Post then picked up the Mohlenoff story on page one. The
                    assumption was that I'd done something illegal. It was humiliating and it
                    hurt.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: I'll tell you what I did. I called Ben Bradley.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was the top editor of the Washington Post.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: I said, “Ben, that story is miserable and untrue and you had no
                    business writing it. He said, “Do you want to talk to me about it?” and I said,
                    “Yes. I'll lay it all out for you.” So I came up to the Washington Post and he
                    called the editors together along witKatherine Graham, the Publisher. I came
                    with all the data on my role, and the philosophy behind the transaction; and I
                    laid it all out - why it was a good deal. Actually, it turned out to be a good
                    economic deal because the deal went through. That would be helpful. I don't know
                    what's happening today, but I believe the Indians' project was successful after
                    a difficult birth.</p>
                <p>I laid the whole thing out for the newspaper and that was the end, except for a
                    postscript. Some years later I was in Geneva on government business and a
                    reporter from the Washington Post came to cover it; he told me that the reporter
                    who wrote the story for the Washington Post was reprimanded for writing that
                    story. As a matter of fact, some of my press friends became indignant and were
                    of assistance to me. One of them was Neil McNeil from Time magazine; Marianne
                    Means of the Hearst newspapers; another was John King from The New York Times.
                    The result was that Clark Mohlenoff, who was then the vice president of the
                    Press Club and was scheduled to be the next president, was never moved to the
                    presidency. It was the first time, I was told, that a vice president of the club
                    did not become the president of the club.</p>

                <p>***</p>
                <p>Let's talk about Humphrey's politics now. During the time you were with Senator
                    Humphrey, which was when to when?</p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: From January 1949 when he first took the oath of office as a senator
                    until October 1955 when I decided - actually I decided a year earlier - that it
                    was time to leave. So that was six-and-a-half years. It was his first term plus
                    the first congressional session after his reelection.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During that time what do you feel were his major
                        accomplishments?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: Well, I believe that he became the leader of the liberals of the
                    Senate, which was in itself a very important accomplishment. I think he
                    certainly made a major accomplishment in freeing the Democratic Party from the
                    shackles of very narrow minded conservative and bigoted Southern influence; and
                    I think that may have ended up, historically, to be his most important
                    contribution. But fundamentally, for me, he was the voice of responsible
                    American liberalism. In the Senate he mobilized senators, was the sponsor of
                    important legislation, and introduced into the liberal movement a sense of “real
                    politick,” a practical real politick as a politician.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the trade unions during this time? How
                        did he get along with the trade unions and all of that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: When he was mayor, and as a political activist in Minneapolis before
                    his election, he was faced with the fact that a large element of the trade union
                    movement in Minnesota was communist controlled. The Democratic Farmer Labor
                    Party which he helped create in 1944 was significant; up until 1944 there was a
                    Republican Party, a Democratic Party, and a Farmer Labor Party. He, working with
                    the National Democratic Party, was able to merge the Democratic Party and the
                    Farmer Labor Party in 1944 so that Roosevelt could get the electoral votes from
                    Minnesota during Roosevelt's 1944 election period. In 1946, the communist trade
                    unions were able to work hard in the state and attract what I would consider
                    extreme left-wingers, and others who were not, and they took over control of the
                    Democratic Farmer Labor Party in 1946. On the other hand, they recognized that
                    he was really the leader of the party, not in title, but he had been elected
                    mayor in 1945; there weren't that many Democrats in public office; there was in
                    St. Paul and Duluth. He spoke at the 1946 Convention, but they outvoted him and
                    the only thing he really was able to do was to get a deal made under which the
                    Secretary of the Democratic Farmer Labor Party was his choice and he chose
                    Orville Freeman, his friend, who later became the Secretary of Agriculture, and
                    also the Governor of Minnesota.</p>
                <p>But losing in 1946, the party, he determined with his friends and associates to
                    take the party back in 1948. That meant undermining quite a few of the labor
                    unions and strengthening the forces within the labor movement, like the steel
                    workers and the auto workers, who were not part of the communist movement.
                    Fortunately for him, and maybe for all of us, Philip Murray, who was then the
                    head of the steel workers union, and the head of the CIO, decided that something
                    had to be done about the communists and the labor movement; and so he and Arthur
                    Goldberg, who was a lawyer in Chicago for the labor movement and for the Steel
                    Workers Union, and then he appointed Goldberg also to be the attorney for the
                    CIO; and they, with the help of other trade union leaders, began a drive to
                    defeat communist control. This included the Electrical Workers Union, the
                    Longshoremen Union - quite a few of the unions - the Fur Workers of New York;
                    and the leadership helped him in Minnesota.</p>
                <p>He met with Philip Murray and they sent people in to politically stimulate the
                    unions, and it involved me as well because I had been, I think I indicated,
                    associated with the Garment Workers Union and with the Textile Workers Union as
                    a youngster. The Textile Workers Union people whom I knew came to me and asked
                    me if I would serve as a paid consultant to the Textile Workers Union while I
                    was teaching and advise their Minnesota unions, which I agreed to do. The
                    faculty had organized not a large but an effective branch of the American
                    Federation of Teachers which was tied in with the American Federation of
                    University Professors, and I was elected as delegate to the AF of L Central
                    Labor Party in Minneapolis. So I was able, with friends, to help Humphrey.</p>
                <pb facs="0067" n="Page0067"/>
                <p>By 1948 I was not at the Democratic Chicago Convention because by then I had just
                    left the University of Minnesota. I left at the end of the semester in June of
                    1948 to take a job in Vermont at Bennington College teaching political science.
                    That summer I spent at the University oWisconsin School for Workers where I was
                    a faculty member. I had been there for a previous summer as well. But in 1948 at
                    the convention of the Democratic Farmer Labor Party Orville Freeman and Hubert
                    Humphrey and their group were able to take control of the Minnesota party. A
                    number of the former communists had changed. You have to understand that
                    Minnesota itself had a history of violence in the labor movement years back. It
                    was very, very much, not Russian, but left-wing radicals who were traditionally
                    in that central part of the United States. So the tradition is there and the
                    communists built on that tradition. But Humphrey was very much supported by the
                    labor movement as mayor and they were very effective in helping him win the
                    state when he ran for the Senate in 1948.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In '48 to '55 did Humphrey continue to be close to the
                        unions during this time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: He was close to the unions continually. He was sympathetic even though
                    he was from South Dakota where there were no unions and they were extremely
                    supportive of him, as he was supportive of them. One of the first pieces of
                    legislation he introduced was to abolish the Taft-Hartley law. It was a very,
                    very close relationship both with the CIO and the AFL. Philip Murray and Walter
                    Reuther became good friends; and David Dubinsky of the Garment Workers Union,
                    and Alex Rose of the Hat Cap Millinery Workers Union were all very close. And
                    the teachers unions were all very close to him. They had access to me and to the
                    office and we had access to them when we needed their help.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did they act as a positive force or were they a special
                        interest group?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: The AF of L was more special interest than the CIO was. But the AF of
                    L went along. The CIO, for example, was very much interested in health
                    legislation and the Missouri Valley Authority, which is the extension of the TVA
                    principle for the Missouri Valley, and civil rights; both the AFL and CIO were
                    very active. He worked for all kinds of legislation, a lot of it like minimum
                    wages which dealt with working, but also beyond that; also international
                    relations, particularly the CIO was interested in international relations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well you mentioned that during this period you got
                        involved with Channel 26. If you can explain what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: I got involved with Channel 26 and other public activities after I
                    left Humphrey.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0068" n="Page0068"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Alright. Well then this would be after '55.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: After 1955.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had several clients but you didn't want to be a
                        lobbyist.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: I don't want to repeat that. I went into that, but time brings the
                    unexpected.</p>
                <p>We sold our house to a couple. I was then in Wilmington, Delaware on behalf of a
                    client in a stockholder's meeting. We put up our house for sale in Chevy Chase
                    and we bought a house here. My wife called me on the telephone and said that
                    there was a buyer right there on the scene and that one of them wanted to talk
                    to me. So I got on the phone and it turned out to be Mitch Miller, the talented
                    musician.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh yes. He was very?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: Mitch Miller was the in-law of the couple that was buying our house
                    and so he and I negotiated the deal. He was a businessman on the telephone and
                    we came to an agreement on price and all the rest. The man of the couple we sold
                    it to, was the new associate director of the National Zoo and we became very
                    good friends. As a matter of fact, our kids would go to the zoo and he would
                    give them special tours. At one point there was a baby tiger born and he took
                    the baby tiger home and invited our kids over so that they could see the baby
                    tigers. We were really family friends.</p>
                <p>One day he called me and said he'd like to come over to visit with the director
                    of the zoo; and he did. They had a problem: a group of neighbors and citizens
                    were forming a “Friends of the National Zoo” organization and they were worried
                    about it, these two, because the New York zoological park was apparently run by
                    the citizens' group, much to the discomfort of the professionals in the New York
                    zoo. This is what I was told; I don't know if that's true. They had wanted my
                    advice on how to handle this. So I advised the director and the associate
                    director to cooperate with the citizens. I didn't know much about the zoo other
                    than taking my kids there. I said, “Get them on your side. They can be helpful
                    to you. Just don't be an obstructionist.” They took my advice.</p>
                <pb facs="0069" n="Page0069"/>
                <p>I'm again in Delaware, in Wilmington, at another client's business, when my wife
                    called me on the telephone and she said, “I didn't know you agreed to be the
                    president of the Friends of the National Zoo.” I said, “What are you talking
                    about?” Well, she says, “I've just heard from Lear Grimer that they had a
                    meeting tonight and they elected you first president of the Friends of the
                    National Zoo.” So that was my first citywide responsibility here. What I found
                    as president of the Friends of the National Zoo is that tuberculosis was rampant
                    among the animals, that one little girl had stuck her hand in a cage and an
                    animal had clawed it seriously and that the zoo was in terrible shape. So one of
                    the things I did was to persuade a number of agencies that instead of the zoo's
                    budget counting as part of the D.C. budget, since this was a national zoo it
                    ought to get national funds from the Congress via the Smithsonian, and it is now
                    that. Anyhow, that was one community activity I got involved in.</p>
                <p>I got a phone call one day - it was the first year of Kennedy's presidency; that
                    would have been 1961. I got a telephone call in 1961 from Newton Minow, who had
                    just been selected chairman of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). I
                    had met Newton in 1956 when Stevenson ran for the presidency. He was associated
                    with Stevenson; he was a lawyer in Chicago. He called me in 1960 to say he was
                    coming to Washington as Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission and
                    would I represent him on a real estate transaction - I did - and then he called
                    me on the phone after he was in Washington and in effect what he said was that
                    he wanted me to become Chairman of the public television station in Washington,
                    Channel 26. I remember saying to him, “Newt, I've never watched the station. I
                    know it exists, but it's UHF (Ultrahigh Frequency) and we don't get UHF on our
                    television, and in our neighborhood.” Well, he arranged for me to have lunch
                    with him and Willard Kiplinger, who was the founder of the Kiplinger Newsletter
                    and who was one of the founders of Channel 26, and they persuaded me to become
                    chairman of Channel 26. I couldn't say no to Newt.</p>
                <p>I found a mess. I found a wonderful, wonderful lady who was running it and
                    sponsoring it; a lady by the name of Elizabeth Campbell. I think she's 100 years
                    old this year. She was interested in having television in the Virginia schools
                    as part of the classroom operations. They had a studio in Virginia; they had
                    been in a high school and they had been informed they had to move. They had no
                    place to go; they had no money; they didn't have proper management. They had a
                    superb engineer. I had to throw myself into this challenge. It took a lot of my
                    time. I familiarized myself with the organization. There was an eastern
                    educational network consisting of New York, Washington, Pittsburgh, Boston. I
                    hired somebody that they recommended to me. I had fired the fellow who was in
                    charge and I got the new fellow in who really knew his business. I persuaded Jim
                    Narrit, who was the president of Howard University and who was a friend of mine,
                    to make room on campus for our television station to be using that campus and
                    for us to run a course for any of their students who wanted to know about
                    communications. We worked a deal out. We did that and I persuaded every college
                    president in this area to join the board. I felt it was an educational station.
                    I wanted them on the board.</p>
                <pb facs="0070" n="Page0070"/>
                <p>So we built up the board very nicely and now we needed some money. So I went to
                    see John Kluge, who was then the head of Channel 5. I talked to him and I
                    explained to him who I was and what I was; and I said I thought that the
                    commercial stations had a duty to support this educational - we called it
                    educational television - we didn't call it public television at that time. I had
                    heard that he was having difficulties with the Federal Communications
                    Commission. I also remember saying to him that if our station went out of
                    business the channel would probably be taken by some commercial station, which
                    would be competition for him. To make a long story short, he gave us $250,000. I
                    went with that to NBC in New York, who had a station here at Channel 4, and they
                    gave us $100,000. I received nothing out of Channel 9, which was owned by The
                    Washington Post. But Kiplinger helped raise money so we got enough money to be
                    able to handle our job. John Kluge recently received an award from the Library
                    of Congress. He just gave them a few million dollars and there was a big story
                    about him. I've seen John Kluge on occasion since, always thanking him again for
                    that initial contribution.</p>
                <p>Now, on this scene of building our station, the head of the Boston station, a man
                    by the name of Hartford Gunn, a very capable man, called me on the telephone and
                    said, “Max, our Boston audience;” - he had a good, successful station tied in
                    with the universities; we were secondhand - “we can not function without
                    servicing more public service political work,” and, “I'm going to have to send
                    somebody down to Washington and open up a Washington office.” And I said, “I
                    don't want you to. I can't permit that to happen.” Well, he says, “I've got no
                    choice.” So I said, “Give me a few months and I'll put something together
                    because I want one in our area as well.” And I had in mind doing a program.</p>
                <p>I had a friend by the name of Neil McNeal who was the chief congressional
                    correspondent of Time-Life. When I was teaching I saw his book, which I
                    considered to be the most authoritative book on the House of Representatives and
                    I used it when I was teaching political science. So when I came to Washington in
                    1949 I wanted to meet him, so I did meet him and we became friends. I asked him
                    if he would be willing to do a weekly fifteen minute show on the Congress. I
                    pointed out to him that very little educational effort entered any of the
                    stations, radio or television, about how the Congress worked; and I wanted him
                    to tell us the important things happening in the Congress that week. He liked
                    the idea and he started doing that, and it took off very nicely.</p>
                <p>I then talked to Neil about building this up and we got a hold of enough people;
                    I had a former student, whose name escapes me, who was then the military
                    correspondent of the Washington Evening Star, the Pentagon correspondent. He was
                    bright; I had him as a student in Minnesota. I persuaded him to join this group
                    and to talk about the Pentagon. I was introduced to a man by the name of David
                    Willis from the Christian Science Monitor and I persuaded him to come on board.
                    And that's what got started with the Washington Week in Review. Willis was then
                    assigned by the Christian Science Monitor elsewhere and I got a hold of Pete
                    Lisigor of the Chicago Daily News, whom I had met and was considered the dean of
                    Washington journalists; and nothing like this existed any place, on any
                    station.</p>
                <pb facs="0071" n="Page0071"/>
                <p>I had Bill McCarter, our new station manager, find a moderator. I wanted a
                    moderator who was not a reporter; I wanted a moderator and an academic who could
                    challenge the reporters. I recommended my professor, Evron Kirkpatrick, who was
                    Jeane's husband - they were not married then - but somehow McCarter said he
                    didn't do well on the air. I mentioned Richard Scammon who later became Head of
                    the census bureau. Anyhow, they started with somebody from NBC. McCarter came to
                    me a couple of weeks after that and he said, “Max, this isn't working. This
                    isn't what you want,” and I knew it wasn't what I wanted. I wanted it to be
                    educational. And McCarter said, “I would like you to try. You know what you
                    want.” So I became moderator. I received an Emmy for my moderating role which is
                    now in my office. Washington Week in Review was adopted by the whole Eastern
                    Education Network. Boston was satisfied, Pittsburgh, Philadelphia; and it made
                    the rounds in Chicago. It began to spread! I had people stop me in airports; it
                    got to be a very popular program. And that's how I got involved in television. I
                    left as moderator in 1967 or 1968 when it became clear to me that Humphrey was
                    going to be running for president and I wanted to help him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're talking about '68.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You said Kennedy. You started with Newt Minow when Kennedy
                        came?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: That's right. In 1968 I knew Humphrey wanted to run. So I gave it up
                    in '68 because I felt that if I was going to be associated with Humphrey and his
                    campaign I did not want to be in a position of being a moderator on a public
                    television program. That's when I gave it up. It was interesting and I enjoyed
                    it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're talking about essentially the government process
                        and the political process. And just by picking issues it has political
                        clout. Was this a problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0072" n="Page0072"/>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: Let me be more specific about this, and why I was a good moderator, if
                    I say so myself. My political science training helped. We were then broadcasting
                    on Thursday nights and I called each one of these fellows Thursday afternoon:
                    “What are you going to talk about tonight?” I found that each of them was going
                    to talk about the story he was writing for his newspaper that day. That didn't
                    satisfy me. I didn't want that. What I kept saying to them is, “Think about what
                    happened this week that the history books might refer to, or that if you were
                    writing history five years from now, you would refer to it. I want to know that
                    story. I'm not interested in the newspapers. Assume every one of your viewers
                    reads the daily newspapers.” And that was my theme constantly with them; it was
                    a constant struggle. It took a while but they came to understand what it was I
                    was looking for. For example, I can remember this vividly; they were calling up
                    some troops for something - I don't remember what by then my student was no
                    longer at the Evening Star, they'd sent him elsewhere, and I enlisted Charles
                    Cowdry of the Baltimore Sun - a military expert; I remember saying to Charlie,
                    “Charlie, what were the options that the Defense Department had that day when
                    they made that decision? What were the alternatives? What was the opposition to
                    it?” and that's the way we were. The program exists today; that is, one reporter
                    talks, the others ask questions - they take turns, but they are not as
                    analytical as I would like.</p>
                <p>I must confess to you that I don't watch the program that much these days because
                    I don't find it's as analytical. But I know it's a popular program; I know it's
                    good. To give you an example of my philosophy: my philosophy was that we must
                    not emulate the commercial stations. We must supplement the commercial stations.
                    For example, when the State of the Union message is broadcasted over every
                    network. I at that time said we will not broadcast it because it duplicated the
                    commercial stations. What about those people who don't want to watch the State
                    of the Union? The alternative programs: music when there is talk on the
                    commercials. That's why we exist, to provide an option for the minority. At one
                    point we broadcast - what was the name of the conservative who runs the national
                    review?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Buckley?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: Bill Buckley. He had his television program on the air. Nobody else in
                    Washington had it; it was just beginning that program. We ran it for a time.
                    Staff called me on the telephone: “Bad news.” I said, “What's the matter?”
                    “Channel 5 has offered him time on their station and though he likes us he's
                    going to get paid for that and there's a bigger audience.” So they were down in
                    the dumps. I said, “Exclaim in joy! Don't be worried. That's great. Come up with
                    more programs that the commercials will take over from us. That's our job.” So
                    that was my philosophy in this approach. Anyhow, I thoroughly enjoyed it. Some
                    months ago I was invited to a board meeting at Channel 26; I hadn't been there
                    in many, many, many years, but they had an anniversary and Sharon Rockefeller is
                    now the chairman and they had a little function at their home and she wanted me
                    to come and talk about the old times.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you run into any problems from Congress saying, “What
                        are you doing messing around with this political issue?”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: Never. None at all. Of course, first of all, we were responsible and
                    we had the cream of the crop. I mean our people were good. And also, you've got
                    to understand, we only slowly became a national audience. We began as an eastern
                    audience, and then became national.</p>
                <p>But you could say that I got active in community affairs.</p>

                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: Oh sure. That's how I earned my living. As a matter of fact, when I
                    started as a lawyer there were just three of us. I can only tell you today there
                    about 140. The firm has done very well. The firm did very well when I was there
                    and even better since I left. I always continued; this was my livelihood, the
                    law. I've always felt a sense of responsibility to find time to do other things
                    and I found the time to do things in the community.</p>

                        contentious people, you know. Full of ideas and?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: It didn't interfere. I'm not conscious of a single act of interference
                    by any administration, Democratic or Republican. I think we were respected. We
                    got an Emmy for public service broadcasting. We were well-known, but no
                    interference at all. Never. I think, had any of the people - Pete Lisigor,
                    Charlie Cordry, Neil McNeal - gotten any flack I would've heard about it. They
                    would have talked to me. But there was no flack, no interference; we did our
                    job. We did our job rather well. And I thoroughly enjoyed it and I frankly
                    enjoyed the prominence. You know, it's an ego boom when people stop you. People
                    still remember. I still have people talk to me about the Washington Week in
                    Review.</p>

                <p>KAMPELMAN: We had none. There was no need to. We had none. We did our job. I
                    don't think any of them looked upon us as competitors. First of all, it was a
                    UHF station before UHF became stylish as a result of Newt Minows passing
                    regulations under the Federal Communications Commission Act. I found no
                    difficulties and I don't think our people did. The other stations accepted us.
                    As I said, I remember one night the engineers came to me and said that one of
                    the commercials was prepared to let us use their equipment if we wanted to
                    broadcast the State of the Union. I simply said no. It was not an alternative
                    from my point of view. I watched the State of the Union. No, no problems that I
                    saw. I've been active in many areas, as you can tell; people call on me and if I
                    can do it and I have the time to do it I respond. And I have responded over the
                    years. It's always been enriching and not troublesome.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your law practice continued. Were you doing the zoo at the

                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: Yes, but that ended. In each case when it was time for me to end it
                    ended and I would become chairman emeritus. When people ask me today I say my
                    profession is that of being a chairman emeritus. I'm chairman emeritus of the
                    station; I'm chairman emeritus of the Friends of the National Zoo; I'm on the
                    stationary as chairman emeritus of the Georgetown University Institute of the
                    Study oDiplomacy; of the American Academy of Diplomacy, and of the Woodrow
                    Wilson International Center for Scholars. I'm chairman emeritus United Nations
                    Association. I'm chairman emeritus of the American Friends of the Hebrew
                    University. I'm chairman emeritus of the Jerusalem Foundation. Teddy Kollek, the
                    mayor, asked me to become chairman; I became chairman. When the time came for me
                    to leave, I left. So that's my career, chairman emeritus.</p>

                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: Well, of course, Humphrey was vice president. Did I talk about the '64

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0075" n="Page0075"/>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: In 1960 Humphrey wanted to be the Democratic candidate for president.
                    His opponent was Jack Kennedy. We lost the key primaries. I don't have to go
                    into detail on those unless you ever want to at some point. I'm happy to do it,
                    but not now. Our labor friends, after the West Virginia primary was won by
                    Kennedy, disappointed Humphrey. We found that the Catholic labor people were
                    very proud of having a Catholic as president of the United States and didn't
                    give us the support which we thought was warranted, that Humphrey thought was
                    warranted. Also we were outspent; but for whatever reasons we lost.</p>
                <p>The labor people then came to see me and asked me if I would arrange an
                    appointment with Humphrey, which I did. Now who's “they?” They were Arthur
                    Goldberg, who was general counsel, there was David Dubinsky of the Garment
                    Workers Union, Walter Reuther of the Auto Workers, and Alex Rose of the
                    Millinery Workers Union. Goldberg was very close to Kennedy. The four of them
                    said that they wanted Humphrey to be selected as the vice presidential candidate
                    with Kennedy in 1968. They also said they had discussed this with Kennedy; that
                    Kennedy said that Humphrey had not said a word to him since the primaries even
                    though they were both on the Senate floor frequently, which was probably true.
                    He was very unhappy, particularly with Bobby Kennedy, because we had been
                    getting reports of rather scurrilous material coming out of Bobby Kennedy. They
                    said they wanted us to know their plan. They weren't asking for anything other
                    than for Humphrey and Kennedy to say hello to each other on the Senate floor and
                    to meet and chat. Humphrey agreed, but neither he nor I took seriously the vice
                    presidential talk. Humphrey told me that Kennedy did come over to him and they
                    chatted. He liked Jack - he always did like Jack - but so be it.</p>
                <p>Goldberg kept reporting to me the progress being made and finally he told me it's
                    done. We have a commitment; it's going to happen. Again, I was skeptical but
                    they told Humphrey, and I think Humphrey was skeptical, but I don't know. I flew
                    to Los Angeles before the convention. I got a call from Humphrey in Minneapolis
                    saying that he and Muriel were arriving by plane on a certain hour and would I
                    meet them at the airport. So I went to the airport and I met the plane and he
                    took me inside and he said, “Tell our friends that all bets are off.” I sat down
                    and said, “I've seen them since I've been here. They're convinced that something
                    is going to happen that you will be the Vice Presidential candidate.” He said,
                    “I am not interested. Muriel doesn't want it. Mostly she doesn't want to be part
                    of anything to do with that Kennedy family. Just tell them no. And I don't want
                    to see them in Los Angeles.” So I went back and I told them no and it ended up
                    with Lyndon Johnson.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Bobby Kennedy was really hard for a lot of people to
                        digest, wasn't he?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: Really hard, yes. I never knew the man, really. I've met him but I
                    never knew him. From the reports we were getting, particularly in Wisconsin and
                    West Virginia, they were really horrible reports.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0076" n="Page0076"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well apparently Kennedy money went in personal money and
                        Bobby Kennedy, of course, then was heavily tainted with McCarthy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: He was. Anyhow, that was that. Johnson was vice president; Johnson
                    becomes president. I want to say to you that Humphrey and Kennedy became very
                    close when Kennedy was president. Not Bobby, but Jack. Very close. Larry O'Brien
                    and Kenny O'Donnell, whom I knew, said to me, “He's the most loyal fellow we've
                    got in the Congress. Jack loves him.” And I know he spent a lot of time with
                    Jack. I may have mentioned at some point - I don't really remember what we
                    talked about - but at one point Kennedy's man, Mike Feldman, called me on the
                    telephone. Did I talk about that?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: He called me on the telephone and said, “Hubert was just here pushing
                    a judgeship for somebody and the president wants to know why he doesn't come in
                    with your name.” I said, “Well, tell the president Hubert has never come in with
                    my name because I've never asked him to come in with my name.” But it gives you
                    an idea of the closeness there.</p>
                <p>Humphrey called me the day of the funeral and he said, “Can you and Maggie join
                    Muriel and me for dinner tonight?” and I said, “Yes, we'll come out.” I knew he
                    was crushed by the death. One other person there, Adlai Stevenson. We had
                    dinner. Adlai Stevenson had to leave to make a plane. Hubert starts cleaning the
                    carpets, which is what he always did; and went to wash the dishes. He motioned
                    for me to come along and help him wash the dishes. And he said, “Max, I saw the
                    president this afternoon,” - this was after the funeral - “and he wants you to
                    be his counsel. He doesn't trust Ted Sorensen; he doesn't trust Mike Feldman. He
                    wants you to be his counsel.” My wife heard this and exclaims, “Hubert, you
                    can't do this to Max!” and I sat down with Hubert and I explained to him why I
                    couldn't do it, and wouldn't do it. One of the reasons I gave, and I gave a
                    number of reasons, one of which was that I knew Johnson very well and knew how
                    brilliant he was; but I also knew how cruel he was - never to me, always
                    respectful to me, but I knew if I began working for him it would certainly no
                    longer be respectful because I knew how he treated people who worked for him.
                    But I also said to Humphrey, “Hubert, I've given some thought since the
                    assassination; he's going to need a vice president in 1964. You're the guy for
                    that. And what I want to do now is I want to use my time to see to it you become
                    the vice president. I can't do that if I work for Johnson because even if I
                    don't help you and I'm working for him, he'll think I am.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0077" n="Page0077"/>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: So I ended up working for him for vice president and we worked very
                    hard. We met right here in the living room. I got a group of five or six of us
                    together and we planned it. We went around the country. And by 1964 we felt that
                    it was inevitable.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any other candidates?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: There were, and a lot of people had talked about it. I knew that Gene
                    McCarthy thought he was going to be because Gene told me. I told Gene, “Be
                    careful, Gene. Don't get hurt by this,” because Johnson was playing with it. One
                    of the reasons I knew we would get it is because I knew the relationship between
                    these two people. They were good friends. They yelled at each other frequently,
                    but they were good friends. Also, one of our small group planning the campaign
                    was Jim Rowe, who lived across the street. He was the first administrative
                    assistant of the president of the United States under Franklin Roosevelt, and
                    was an intimate of Lyndon Johnson's. When Jim accepted my invitation to be a
                    part of our group, saying to me, “I'll have to check,” and I said, “I know you
                    have to check.” He came back and said, “I can help you.” I knew that Johnson
                    wouldn't have said, “You can do it,” if there was a negative. So we worked this
                    thing. I spent from that day in '63 and all of '64 I put a great deal of time
                    into this political effort, and by the convention in Atlantic City Humphrey was
                    selected.</p>
                <p>I will go on to say that the night of the election the president called Humphrey
                    - I was in the suite at the Nicollet Hotel in Minneapolis - and the president
                    said, “Hubert, fly down tomorrow morning to the ranch. We've got to talk.”
                    They'd won the election. And Hubert asked me if I would fly with him to the
                    ranch - we had a private plane, of course, the campaign plane - and I did. We
                    had a larger meeting; Johnson had his staff there and Humphrey's administrative
                    assistant was also there, a very capable fellow. Johnson embarrassed me,
                    frankly, by saying that he didn't think Humphrey had a good staff, and the staff
                    director there; and he was wrong; Humphrey had a good staff. But he didn't think
                    Humphrey had a good staff and he expected me to take over the vice president's
                    staff. And I said, “Mr. President, that's not going to be. I'm not going to get
                    into the government,” and he put me aside and talked some more about it and I
                    just persuaded him I was not going to get into the government service at that
                    point.</p>
                <p>The two went off talking privately by themselves and then we had the meeting
                    together and Johnson says to me in a group, “Well, you're being unpatriotic and
                    refuse to serve your government and your president, but at least you can do one
                    thing for me,” and I said, “What's that Mr. President?”. He said, “The vice
                    president does not have a vice presidential home in our government and I think
                    the vice president ought to have a home. I should have had a home when I was
                    vice president. The vice president of the United States should have a home of
                    his own,” which made sense. “I want you to find it for me,” he says to me. And
                    then he told his staff, “Give Max a pass to the White House. Let him come in
                    when ever he wants to come in,” which was very nice; the task was useful.</p>
                <pb facs="0078" n="Page0078"/>
                <p>And I narrowed it down to two places. I narrowed it down to the Tydings' home;
                    Senator Tydings' father-in-law was Joseph Davies, who had been the ambassador to
                    Moscow, and the Davies' estate is right here on Macomb Street; it's a massive
                    estate. I went to Joe Tydings, the senator, and said, “You know, that would be
                    perfect for a vice presidential residence,” and I told him I had an assignment
                    to try to find it. I said, “Or it would be better for Joseph Davies' estate to
                    become the vice presidential residence.” He said, “I'd love it, but my sisters
                    would want the money.” I said, “You mean they'd only want to sell it?” He said,
                    “Yes, they'd only want to sell it; they wouldn't want to give it.” So I said,
                    “Well, I'll report that to the president.” And then I saw another piece right
                    where the vice president's home is on Massachusetts Avenue which was home of the
                    chief of naval operations. The admiral had that house. I was pushing the
                    Tydings' house so I gave my report to Johnson pushing the Tydings' house. He
                    heard and then he said, “No. I'm not going to spend a dime.” He said, “I want
                    that place where the chief of naval operations is staying.” “He ought to move
                    where the other chiefs are living anyhow,” he said. And he said, “That'll make
                    me popular with the other chiefs.” And I said, “Well, but it's going to make you
                    unpopular with the chief of naval operations.” But that's what he decided.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During the time from '65 to '68 while Humphrey was vice
                        president did you have much work with him?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: Yes, but not too much. He would periodically want to get together and
                    we would talk. Let me also say - it's for history, so I don't mind saying - that
                    when his wife thought that I should come by, either because his morale was down
                    or he had a problem, she'd call me on the telephone and she'd say, “Max, it's
                    time for you to come and have breakfast with us.” By then he didn't have that
                    house. He had an apartment overlooking the Potomac. So I'd go over there for
                    breakfast and he and I would walk and he would talk about what's on his mind.
                    But that wasn't frequently. That was occasionally. Recently there was a
                    twenty-fifth anniversary of the Humphrey School at the University of Minnesota.
                    I think I mentioned this to you. I sent you my speech, I think. I don't know if
                    you got it or not.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, I have the speech and the book.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: When I was introduced to be the banquet speaker the fellow who
                    introduced me was the fellow who helped Humphrey write his book, who had also
                    been a student of mine and was a very capable writer. He introduced me to the
                    group by saying that when he was helping Humphrey with Humphrey's book he had
                    the occasion to look at the Secret Service documents, “The name Kampelman
                    appears in the Secret Service files more often than any other single person
                    except the president.” He turned to me and said, “I didn't realize you spent so
                    much time with him.” So obviously I spent enough time with him that it made the
                    imprint. But it really wasn't that much.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As you said, anybody that is around Lyndon Johnson,
                        particularly in sort of a amorphous position like the vice president, I
                        would think that Lyndon Johnson would get to be so overpowering that
                        Humphrey would need solace or something like that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: That's true. It was a difficult relationship. It was a particularly
                    difficult relationship because Humphrey was persuaded that one of the staff
                    members of Johnson was undermining him with Johnson. I had no evidence of that
                    myself; Humphrey was fully persuaded and so was his staff, and they were
                    referring to Joe Califano. I don't know why that would have been the case, but
                    it was. Apparently, from what they told me, Johnson was capable of pettiness and
                    cruelty. I don't know if you've ever had the chance to read the Cato book?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, I read the first one but I haven't read the second
                        yet.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: This book on the Senate years is fantastic. It deserves all the prizes
                    it can get. But the pettiness also shows the behavior there and that aggravated
                    Humphrey. To give you an example that now hits my mind: when Humphrey was
                    selected as the presidential candidate in 1968 the big debatable issue was
                    Vietnam. The rioting in Chicago was centered around Vietnam and that was serious
                    rioting. I saw a report from the Secret Service at that time which said that
                    there was a plot to kidnap Mrs. Humphrey, and they took it seriously. It was an
                    unpleasant period. The date for that convention was selected to coincide with
                    Johnson's birthday and Johnson was advised not to show up at the convention by
                    the Secret Service and by all of his friends who were at the convention; he
                    didn't show up. So you can imagine how bitter he felt about all of this.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well what about Humphrey during this time that you were
                        seeing him? The Vietnam war was cranking up more and more and he was a good
                        supporter of the president, he was a good soldier. What was he talking to
                        you about as far as Vietnam was concerned?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: We didn't talk that much about Vietnam, except during the campaign. We
                    did not, before the convention, talk much about Vietnam. Humphrey was a
                    supporter. He also knew things that were not generally public. For example, he
                    knew from what he told me, that Johnson did not share Kennedy's desire to
                    proceed with the Vietnam War. At least so he told me; I'm only telling you what
                    he told me. Johnson and Dick Russell - Russell influenced Johnson - felt that we
                    should not pursue it and should try to close the book on it. Johnson was
                    persuaded - McNamara helped persuade him, and others - that he should finish the
                    job. That's what I got from Humphrey. Johnson had asked Cy Vance and Averil
                    Harriman to try to come up with a solution to the Vietnam problem and the talks
                    with North Vietnam began before and during the campaign. I think, it's my
                    recollection, that they took place in Paris.</p>
                <pb facs="0080" n="Page0080"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Talks were going on between Harriman and Vance in
                        Paris.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: There was a great deal of effort under way before the talks would even
                    begin. People who were pushing for Humphrey to be president wanted Humphrey to
                    disassociate himself from Johnson's policy on Vietnam. Humphrey couldn't do
                    that. He wouldn't do it; he couldn't do it. One, it was not loyal; two, he was
                    aware of Johnson's efforts to try to get the talks under way, which were not
                    public. So he was not in that position. So he gave me an assignment which was to
                    review his speeches that were being prepared here in Washington. Most of his
                    speeches were ad-lib. This was a fellow who didn't need the text.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was going to say he was renowned for talking.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: But there were some times when we needed a prepared statement because
                    that's what would get into the newspapers - policy. And he wanted me to review
                    every foreign policy reference to make sure that it did not put him in any
                    dishonest position with respect to the president. He knew that his campaign
                    staff wanted him to separate from the president, and he didn't want to separate
                    from the president. I was aware of this problem.</p>
                <p>Let me say that during the convention, I had two serious proposals for Humphrey
                    at the convention. One of those proposals was that he resign as the vice
                    president at the convention, that he do it in the midst of a very favorable
                    speech about Johnson and his presidency and his role in the Senate and the
                    strengthening of our democracy and his support of the president. But that he
                    should end by saying that there's now an amendment that the constitution
                    provides that the president can replace an absent vice president by submitting a
                    name to the Senate for ratification. This was a constitutional amendment that
                    had just been adopted. The country would not be hurt by this, but he, Humphrey,
                    felt that he had to give every ounce of his energy to defeat Nixon for
                    president; and that that he found this was much more important than his serving
                    as a vice president for the remaining few months when somebody else could fill
                    it. I laid it all out front for him and he didn't want to do it. He said he took
                    a pledge; he took an oath of office and he wasn't going to leave it.</p>
                <pb facs="0081" n="Page0081"/>
                <p>One of my jobs was to find a vice president for Humphrey. I was given that
                    assignment. When he was selected as vice president Lyndon Johnson had Jim Rowe
                    spend hours with him - finances, weaknesses, everything, because Johnson didn't
                    want to have anything not open; and Humphrey wanted me to do the same thing with
                    potential vice presidential candidates. I talked to Jim Rowe and Jim told me the
                    kind of questions he had asked when he had that job. Now I had the job and I
                    interviewed a number. First off, for example, I was looking for an Italian. I
                    had talked to Dick Scammon in the Census Bureau, a good friend, who told me that
                    the key swing votes in many of the industrial states were the Italian-Americans,
                    that they felt discriminated against because of the mafia; that they were
                    self-conscious; that they would be very proud to have an Italian; that they were
                    also moving toward the Republican Party increasingly and that this would bring
                    them back in. But it had to be a qualified person. So I met with the mayor of
                    San Francisco, Joe Alioto. He was a capable man, liked Humphrey; Humphrey liked
                    him. And Joe said, “Max, you don't want me. I was a lawyer before I was mayor.
                    My clients were not the most desirable elements in society. You don't want me
                    because I'll be attacked.” I went to speak to Johnny Pastori, the Senator from
                    Rhode Island; capable, a very fine man. He wouldn't consider it. And I
                    interviewed a number of other people. It was clear to me that Humphrey tilted
                    toward Muskie; from the beginning he tilted toward Muskie, but he wanted other
                    names and I reviewed names for him.</p>
                <p>I explored Sarge Shriver and Teddy Kennedy. Although Humphrey was not for that,
                    he liked Teddy; he didn't feel Teddy was qualified and he thought it would look
                    to gimmicky. But I never talked to Kennedy. Humphrey respected and liked Sarge
                    Shriver. Larry O'Brien and Kenny O'Donnell came back with the “family” doesn't
                    want anybody from the family; and I said, “Does that include Sarge Shriver?” I
                    was told that includes Sarge Shriver. Sarge didn't know that. I later told
                    him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you say “the family,” who spoke for the
                        Kennedys?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: I don't know. I spoke to O'Brien and O'Donnell. I don't know. Was it
                    the father? Was it Jack? Jack was dead. Was it Teddy? I don't know who “the
                    family” was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well they were probably still in shock from the death of
                        Bobby.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: They were probably in shock from the death, that's exactly right.
                    Whatever reasons, and it may not have been personal toward Sarge, I just don't
                    know. I know that Humphrey liked Sarge.</p>
                <pb facs="0082" n="Page0082"/>
                <p>So anyhow, I came up with another idea for vice president. We were at the
                    convention. I thought of Nelson Rockefeller and I spoke to Humphrey about it at
                    length. I did not know Nelson Rockefeller, but I knew he'd been defeated by
                    Nixon in California. I knew that he was a liberal-minded fellow, had mutual
                    friends. I thought the country was wounded and needed to be reunited and I
                    thought that if he could get a Republican in there who was somebody with whom we
                    had compatible interests, that the country would welcome it. After lots of
                    discussion and soul searching on Humphrey's part I got the green light. One of
                    Humphrey's closest friends was a man by the name of Dwayne Andreas, who was the
                    chairman of Archer, Daniels, Midland - at one point a Minnesota company, but
                    moved to Iowa - and who was very close to the Rockefeller family. Former
                    governor Peabody of Massachusetts was a cousin of Nelson Rockefeller. We talked
                    to both of them; I did, Humphrey did not. We got word that Andreas had talked to
                    David Rockefeller and that David Rockefeller would take it up with Nelson
                    Rockefeller, which was encouraging. I was told that Peabody talked directly with
                    Nelson Rockefeller. We needed to know quickly, within a day, and the answer
                    finally came back no; and so he went with Humphrey's original choice,
                    Muskie.</p>
                <p>The following January or February, I don't recall which now - maybe March - I
                    received an invitation from a mutual friend to join Nelson Rockefeller and his
                    wife for dinner at Pocantico and I did. I went up with a mutual friend and there
                    was only two other persons there and they were his older brother and wife. Mrs.
                    Rockefeller was there, a small dinner group, Nelson Rockefeller thanked me.
                    Apparently he knew I had something to do with the exploration. I was sitting
                    next to Mrs. Rockefeller who “sotto voce,” but out loud, said, “I don't know who
                    my husband voted for, but I voted for Hubert Humphrey.” And she let me know so
                    did Nelson, but Nelson never told me that he did and I don't know that he did; I
                    just have reason to believe he did, but I don't know that he did.</p>
                <p>Anyhow, Rockefeller was creating a commission on critical choices in America and
                    he invited me to be a part of it, and I became a part of it. I've got the
                    volumes here in my library. That's how I met Henry Kissinger, through the
                    commission, and I met Henry's wife, Nancy, through the commission. As a matter
                    of fact, I had dinner with both of them a few months ago here in Washington.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The election was really so close and it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0083" n="Page0083"/>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: Let me give you another story about the election being so close, if I
                    may. On the Saturday before the election I received a telephone call at home
                    from Lou Harris, the pollster. He said, “Max, I can't find Hubert; I can't reach
                    him. Can you get him a message?” I said, “Lou, he's in California campaigning
                    today. I can get him a message,” because I had access through the Secret
                    Service; any time I wanted Humphrey I called the Secret Service number and they
                    plugged me in. I said, “I can reach him.” He said, “Well you tell him that he's
                    won the election as of this afternoon.” This was Saturday afternoon. I said,
                    “You better explain that to me.” He said, “I've been talking to Hubert every day
                    this week. Our polls show him steadily and speedily getting up and as of our
                    poll this morning he has passed Nixon, and with this trend continuing he'll be
                    comfortable by Tuesday.” That was quite a report. So I called Hubert and I
                    talked to him, but what I did not know was that later that day Johnson called
                    Humphrey. This is in Clark Clifford's book and in another book critical of
                    Kissinger.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes. Seymour Hirsh.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: It's also in Seymour Hirsh's book.</p>
                <p>Johnson called Humphrey on Sunday to say that they had a tape that told them that
                    Mrs. Chenault had called General Thieu from the Watergate Hotel where she had an
                    apartment, to Thieu in South Vietnam - let me start by saying that the
                    newspapers on Friday indicated something about the Harriman-Vance talks in Paris
                    - and urged Thieu to disown those talks even though he had accepted the
                    agreement and she knew that; and she said to General Thieu, according to these
                    stories - and this is what Johnson told Humphrey - that he would do better under
                    Nixon as president than he would under Humphrey as president; and General Thieu
                    that day, Sunday, was going to renounce the agreement and the Republicans were
                    going to say that this was just a political ploy by Johnson to get Humphrey
                    elected, all of which they said on Sunday and was in the Monday newspapers.</p>
                <p>Johnson told this to Humphrey and he wanted to know what Humphrey advised him to
                    do. And Humphrey said to him, “Does Dick know about this?” Johnson said, “I
                    don't know but I have a call into him; but I wanted to talk to you first.” He
                    talked to Nixon, he called Humphrey back - this I get from Humphrey now - and
                    says that Nixon claims he knew nothing about it and that it must have been a
                    Mitchell operation. And Johnson said, “What do you want me to do?” And Humphrey
                    said, “What do you think I should do about this?” And I don't know more of the
                    details of the conversation other than the decision made not to disclose the
                    Chenault-Thieu talk. Lou Harris later told me that if the election were held on
                    Saturday Humphrey would have won; if the election were held the following
                    Saturday Humphrey would have won. But the timing of this led to defeat.</p>
                <pb facs="0084" n="Page0084"/>
                <p>I had the occasion some years later, after Nixon resigned as president, when he
                    was recouping - you may remember he was again getting active in foreign affairs
                    - Brzezinski called me and asked me if I would join him for dinner with Nixon
                    who wanted to have a conversation on foreign policy with a few people. I don't
                    know whether Brzezinski came up with my name or whether Nixon came up with my
                    name, but I would say there were four or five or six of us sitting around the
                    table with Nixon. It was lovely weather and we were sitting outside on his lawn
                    before we went in to dinner and I sat next to Nixon on the lawn chatting. He
                    wanted to know how Muriel was and I told him. I had known Nixon in the Senate
                    and I had known him as president. He said, “Hubert was a great patriot,” and I
                    said, “Are you referring to election eve of 1968?” He said, “I'm referring to
                    election eve of 1968 and Hubert was a great patriot.” And then he added,
                    himself, “You know,” he says, “I had a dilemma when I ran for president,” and I
                    knew what he was talking about and I said, “I think I know what you're talking
                    about, Mr. President.” And he said, “My people told me that we could prove that
                    Illinois and Texas went to me and not to Kennedy, if it weren't for fraud. They
                    wanted me to protest and get a recount in Illinois and in Texas and I wouldn't
                    do it. I don't think we ought to be having these kind of problems in this
                    democracy of ours. The president is selected; there it is. Accidents happen.”
                    Which was interesting.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was very foggy, particularly Illinois.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: I don't know what happened. All I know is what Nixon told me about it.
                    I can't vouch for that. I don't know. It may be Nixon was making it up to make
                    him feel good, but I don't think he was lying to me when he said people were
                    asking him to challenge the vote. Anyhow, that was the Humphrey thing and of
                    course Humphrey ran again for the Senate and got elected.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get involved in that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: No, but there's a Minnesota thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well I think this might be a good place to stop here and
                        we'll pick this up after the loss of Hubert Humphrey and the presidential
                        election of 1968 and what you did. But we've talked about Channel 26; we've
                        talked about the zoo; but let's talk about what you did after as a
                        diplomat.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well let's start on your diplomatic career. What
                        happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0085" n="Page0085"/>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: Well, my diplomatic career didn't really start until 1980. My
                    activities from '68 were increasingly foreign affairs, defense policy, on top of
                    an active law practice. Nixon got elected in 1968 and I knew him but not well. I
                    was just trying to focus and get my head together a little bit. What I did
                    actually, politically, for a moment is I persuaded Humphrey to come back to
                    Washington from Minnesota. He decided just to go back home to Minnesota once a
                    month and I organized a lunch once a month. He was pleased to be back; he had
                    friends here and he wanted to keep in touch with politics. I arranged the
                    monthly luncheon at the Madison Hotel, to which I brought journalists, political
                    figures and public officials. It was not a large lunch; we might have a dozen
                    people, just to keep him alive and to keep his prospects alive. Other than that
                    I would say that most of my activity was professional.</p>
                <p>In the early 1970s, at the end of the Nixon administration, Paul Nitze and?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Wait a minute. The Nixon administration came in in
                        '69.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: In '69 and they had until 1972. I ought to say maybe a word about the
                    '72 election where George McGovern was the candidate. Humphrey thought he should
                    be the candidate and wanted to be the candidate. I don't recall whether I went
                    into the '68 election year, but let me just say that I think I did discuss with
                    you, but I don't want to repeat any, the telephone call I received from the
                    pollster.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, you did.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: So Humphrey felt that he had a good shot at beating Nixon in 1972. I
                    felt that; many of his people felt that, and we began organizing to that end.
                    The Vietnam issue became the focus around which the left-wing of the Democratic
                    Party concentrated. The younger people seemed influenced by that and we
                    understood that. We began organizing and we found it was difficult to raise
                    money in 1972. The Democratic National Party arrived at a decision that since
                    the primaries were very important, the primary vote in a state would not go to a
                    hundred percent of the winner. If it were fifty-one/forty-nine that's the way
                    the vote should be apportioned. And the National Committee of the Democratic
                    Party adopted that as a state policy, which we had no problem with. McGovern
                    meanwhile had a lot of money and spent it effectively.</p>
                <pb facs="0086" n="Page0086"/>
                <p>It was a strange competition because McGovern really owed his political career
                    and beginning to Humphrey. Furthermore, they lived practically next door to each
                    other here in Washington for a long time. McGovern, nevertheless, had ambitions
                    and he was being pushed forward. We did fairly well in the competition.
                    California was a crucial state. Our leader in California was a lawyer by the
                    name of Eugene Wyman and his wife. He was a successful lawyer, and a good loyal
                    friend of Hubert's. He had a budget for California, which he raised. We needed
                    more money. I didn't get involved in the finances but those who did know they
                    were inadequately supplied with funds. Wyman called me one day and he said,
                    “Max, I'm being pressed to give some of my money to the campaign outside of
                    California. I don't really want to do that; I need that.” I said, “Eugene, I
                    don't really have a judgment on that because I don't know who asked you, I don't
                    know what is involved,” because I didn't get involved in that part of the
                    campaign. He called me on the phone and said that Humphrey called him and he
                    decided to do it, but that it was going to damage us.</p>
                <p>He asked me to come out to California and I did come out to California to look
                    around the state with him. At one point he called me on the telephone and he
                    said he lost the black vote in San Francisco. I said that's ridiculous. Humphrey
                    was the leader of the civil rights movement. I remember he said yes, but the
                    black vote in San Francisco was controlled by the name of the congressman whose
                    name is out of my mind at the moment; although his brother, I notice in the
                    press, is one of the leaders now of the California legislature. But he said it
                    requires a lot of “walking around” money to win. I remember the term “walking
                    around money.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I just read a definition of this in Tom Wolf's book The
                        Man in Full.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: And he continued, “We've lost San Francisco.” This was even before the
                    primary election.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: “Walking around money,” as I understand it essentially you
                        pay somebody to get out the vote who does god knows what. Usually there's a
                        payoff.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: Regrettably it was an important part of the black vote. Anyhow, the
                    result of California was - don't hold me to it - the figures may be
                    fifty-one/forty-nine or something like that. Maybe it was fifty-two/forty-eight.
                    The national convention was in Miami. Humphrey asked me to watch over the
                    procedures in Miami. We had a campaign organization, but I, as Hubert knew,
                    never really got deeply involved in the campaign business, just as an adviser to
                    him. Forty-nine states had their votes divided between the candidates, including
                    the primary states. There's a dispute on California. The California party
                    refuses to split the convention delegation and comes in with a 100% McGovern
                    delegation. I counted; that would put them over the top. It was the only state
                    including the minority vote.</p>
                <pb facs="0087" n="Page0087"/>
                <p>The chairman of the convention was Larry O'Brien, a Kennedy man and a good friend
                    of Humphrey's. He had indeed been our campaign manager in '68. The convention
                    started; there was going to be a discussion and a debate at the convention of
                    the California delegation. I went to see Larry and I said, “Larry, there
                    shouldn't even be a debate about this. The Democratic National Committee has
                    ordered a division. It's a clear statement and you know if we split the vote,
                    Humphrey gets the convention majority,” which was indeed the case. He listened
                    attentively, didn't say anything, but he had to make a ruling as chairman; and
                    he made a ruling against us. I was appalled. I went to Larry and I said, “Larry,
                    I'm appalled. There must be something?” He takes me aside and he says, “Look
                    Max, our chances of defeating Nixon are not good. I think Hubert has a shot at
                    it; McGovern has no shot at it; but I don't think Hubert could win against an
                    existing president like Nixon.” This was before the scandal. “Now, if I rule for
                    Humphrey the lefties in the party are going to walk out of the convention; if I
                    rule for McGovern the Humphrey people will not walk out of the convention and
                    we'll have a united party.” He says, “I don't feel I had a choice.” As you know
                    it was a fiasco. First McGovern chooses a Senate with a history of menial
                    problems. Sarge Shriver, who was a partner of our law firm is then chosen and we
                    lost. So there you go.</p>
                <p>Paul Nitze and Eugene Rostow later came to see me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was after the election?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: This was after the election. Concerned about detente, which Nixon was
                    pushing; concerned about the deterioration, they said, of our national defenses.
                    I was not an expert. I had a point of view; I wanted a strong national defense,
                    but I was not an expert. But they said they would like to create an organization
                    of Democrats and Republicans to watch and prepare for a stronger defense for the
                    United States. Would I help them, legally, to organize it, be counsel and join
                    them? I said yes, I would be glad to do that. Meanwhile within the Democratic
                    Party, the Humphrey wing saw the McGovern wing taking over and we decided to
                    organize against them. Pat Moynihan and Ben Wattenberg took the lead with us to
                    try and help us do it, and we had a lot of support.</p>
                <p>My partner, Richard Schifter, who retired with me from our law firm and later
                    became Assistant Secretary of State for Human Rights under George Schultz,
                    helped organizing with Ben Wattenberg. Ben Wattenberg is now with the American
                    Enterprise Institute. They created an organization called Coalition for the
                    Democratic Majority and I associated myself with them. Similarly, Dick Shifter
                    organized a group within the Jewish community called the Jewish Institute for
                    National Security Affairs, which I joined, whose purpose was to emphasis the
                    importance of America's national defense system with adequate military force;
                    and was a counter against a great many in the Jewish community who identified
                    with the McGovern wing of the party.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were the traditional Jewish coming out of the German
                        socialist background?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: We had three defense groups organized and I belonged to all three, but
                    spent more time with the Committee on the Present Danger, which was Nitze's
                    creation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A couple of questions before we move on. I want to talk
                        about this, but just on the political side; at the time, when Watergate
                        first arose did these ring any bells or was this just considered a minor,
                        little?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: To me it was a reflection of Nixon. I had identified Nixon as a kind
                    of extreme right-winger with whom I did not sympathize. I had, for example, been
                    an admirer of Helen Gahagan-Douglas, whom he defeated for the Senate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh yes, that was a nasty election.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: That was a nasty election, but I had rooted personally for her,
                    although I didn't know her. I may have met her once but I didn't really know
                    her. So the Watergate Scandal didn't shock me, but I saw that as an important
                    element which strengthened my loyalty to the Democratic Party, if it was to be
                    the correct kind of a Democratic Party; and we were working to make it a correct
                    version of the Democratic Party.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you seeing as wrong about, at that time, the
                        left wing of the Democratic Party?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: You have to recall that my experience in politics began with Humphrey
                    in Minnesota when we were fighting the Communists who were the left wing of the
                    Democratic Farmer-Labor Party. Up until then I was not a Democrat active in
                    politics at all. I also have to say to you that when I learned during the '68
                    convention of the behavior of these anti-Vietnam activists, it repelled me. When
                    I read Secret Service reports of an effort to kidnap Muriel Humphrey I was
                    outraged. I did not look upon them as a part of the mainstream of American life.
                    I also felt that a great many of the left wing that I had been fighting I
                    thought of as Soviet principals. So I looked upon them as taking advantage of
                    this Vietnam crisis, exaggerating it. I knew, for example, that Johnson had
                    worked quietly, without publicity, with Harriman and Vance to try to get us out
                    of there. I knew that his instincts were not for it, but he felt that he had to
                    carry it out when McNamara said you have to carry out the Kennedy policy, so I
                    did not sympathize or identify with that group in the '60s. Now I was also not a
                    Nixon person and it did not surprise me, frankly, to find Nixon coming up with a
                    solution to Vietnam which was worse, from my point of view, much worse than the
                    deal that Johnson, Vance, Humphrey and Harriman had been working out which would
                    have saved the South Vietnam regime and made it more democratic, as I learned
                    about it. I'm not an expert in that field.</p>
                <pb facs="0089" n="Page0089"/>
                <p>I also believed in a strong national defense, which they were not. They were
                    trying to cut down on national defense. So I could not identify with that left
                    group, although I want to say to you, I lost some friends as a result of this,
                    much to my chagrin and my wife's disappointment. I never put political loyalty
                    as a condition for friendship.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: But there I found it to be the case. Nevertheless, this is where we
                    found ourselves. So the Committee on the Present Danger was organized. We
                    decided not to announce our existence until after the 1976 election because we
                    did not want our group to get involved in the 1976 election. Carter was running;
                    from what I could see, I didn't particularly like the man, but I had no concerns
                    about his foreign policy as he campaigned. We decided not to be a part of the
                    '76 election. But in December, after the election, we announced our existence
                    and our objectives.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How do you keep an organization quiet in Washington?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: Well, we didn't. We didn't announce it, that's all. We didn't announce
                    that it existed. We were not trying to be secret about it. We were not trying to
                    be a secret organization. I think the accurate way to say it is we decided not
                    to announce our presence as a way of not getting involved in the '76 election.
                    Individually, people did what they wanted to do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Basically it was a discussion group?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: Sure, and we developed policy. I was not an expert, but I tell you, I
                    found it an educational experience to sit at executive committee meetings and
                    getting briefings from experts - Paul Nitze, Ed Rowny, scholars we brought in to
                    help us formulate a policy. I learned as much as I could about that, but never
                    really memorized it or absorbed it totally. But I was exposed and I think I
                    absorbed myself in that climate.</p>
                <p>I have not said anything about the 1976 election and let me just say a word about
                    that, if I may.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Certainly.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0090" n="Page0090"/>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: Humphrey made up his mind he was not going to run in 1976. He was in
                    the Senate again. I can tell you people came to him and asked him to run, but
                    Henry Jackson decided to run.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is Scoop Jackson?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: Scoop Jackson, Henry Jackson, of Washington. Humphrey's close people,
                    like me, identified with Jackson. I knew Jackson a long time; I had liked him. I
                    was a friend. And I told him if there is anything I can do I'd contribute it to
                    his campaign. Jackson lost in Pennsylvania, which he expected to win because of
                    the labor movement.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was in the primaries.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: The primaries in 1976. I get a call from Jackson. “We've got to get
                    Hubert to enter the New Jersey primary and to run.” The New Jersey primary was
                    the remaining big primary. I said, “Have you talked to Hubert?” He says, “I have
                    and he refuses to even consider it. But we have to get him to do that.” He
                    didn't like Carter because they fought. Jackson really didn't like Carter.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And Carter wasn't really part of the establishment at all,
                        was he?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: No, nobody knew much about him. That's right. Here is this newcomer
                    from Georgia with a group of people nobody ever heard of is running around and
                    winning. I called a few people and Scoop called a few people and I talked to
                    Hubert about it, and finally Humphrey agreed to consider it. I said, “Look,
                    Hubert, the least you can do is talk to your friends, the ones who are urging
                    you. Let's come over to your office and let's have a meeting and let them be
                    able to try to persuade you.” And he said, “Well, I'll be glad to do that. I owe
                    it to them.” So we all got together on an evening. The next day was the closing
                    date for filing in the New Jersey primary. We talked. Senator Harrison Williams
                    of New Jersey was present, saying, “Hubert, you can win. We've seen the
                    primary.” Jackson's people were showing him polls. And Jackson was ahead of
                    Carter, and certainly Humphrey was ahead of Carter, in New Jersey. And we spent
                    a few hours talking about it.</p>
                <pb facs="0091" n="Page0091"/>
                <p>Humphrey at one point said to me, “Call Muriel.” So I went into another room and
                    I called his wife. And I said, “Hubert asked me to call you,” and she said,
                    “Max, the children and I have talked about this. We told Hubert if he wants to
                    run, we'll back him; we'll support him. We will not be unhappy about it. We're
                    sick and tired of politics.” She said, “Let him decide what to do when you tell
                    him that again.” I told him and Humphrey finally says, “Okay, press conference
                    tomorrow morning at ten o'clock.” Robert Barry, who was working for Senator
                    Williams of New Jersey, agreed to have filing papers signed and to be at the
                    airport at ten o'clock - National airport - and to fly to Trenton once he gets
                    the green light from the press announcement. We wrote up announcement plans to
                    make and gave it to him; I showed up the next morning at the press conference.
                    Humphrey got up and announced he's not running, which astounded me and others
                    because I thought we had gotten to him.</p>
                <p>I later asked him what happened and he said, “Max, in spite of what the doctors
                    told me, I knew I had cancer and I did not want to die in office as president of
                    the United States.” And he said, “My doctors were telling me I could do it.” He
                    did die and his instincts were correct. But that was his decision. What bothered
                    the hell out of me was that after Humphrey's announcement the newspapers
                    reported a statement by Carter saying, “I would've licked the son-of-a-bitch in
                    New Jersey.” You can see that turned me off.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: That turned me off. Now I'm back to the Committee on Present Danger.
                    Carter was elected President of the United States and all of a sudden we don't
                    see the Carter who was in the Navy and who campaigned supporting defense. We
                    suddenly see him pursuing detente with the Soviet Union and being very soft on
                    defense, from our point of view. So, over the next year or more we issued
                    statements - learned, scholarly statements - putting our point of view and our
                    criticism; the Coalition for a Democratic Majority does that and the Jewish
                    Institute for National Security Affairs does less of that because they're not
                    political, but it's studied reports were similarly based.</p>
                <pb facs="0092" n="Page0092"/>
                <p>The Vice President is now Walter Mondale. Walter Mondale and Hubert had been
                    friends since we were both youngsters in Minneapolis. I received a call before
                    the convention from Stuart Eisenstein, who was a friend of mine - he helped
                    Humphrey in 1968 and now was part of the Carter team - and he said, “Max, what
                    would Hubert really think about Mondale for the vice presidency and I want your
                    personal judgment as to whether he is adequate for the job.” Well I said, “Stu,
                    Hubert would be delighted and it would go very far toward reducing the tensions
                    that exist between the two. Secondly, I think it would be a splendid political
                    move for Humphrey people around the country, and they are many, in the labor
                    movement. They don't know Carter, but they know Mondale; they know Humphrey.
                    This would be very good. And thirdly, I think he's highly qualified and a very
                    capable man.” And he was selected. Now, whether my conversation was
                    instrumental, I have no idea. It may have simply supported what they knew,
                    because I wasn't giving them something new. It was common sense.</p>
                <p>So Mondale kept in touch with me, as I said, and he knew that I had a different
                    point of view on foreign policy. His record in the Senate was not something I
                    admired in foreign policy. I didn't like what he did with the CIA (Central
                    Intelligence Agency), for example. And he knew that. We were friends. We had one
                    period of great tension between us but that got resolved. Then Afghanistan
                    happened.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Are you talking about the Soviets moving into Afghanistan
                        at Christmas of 1978 or '79?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: Yes. Carter changed his foreign policy toward the Soviet Union. It was
                    '79 and I'll tell you why I know this. Mondale called me and in effect said,
                    “Max, we're now on a similar wavelength; would you be willing to bring in, to
                    meet the President, some of our Democratic friends who have been critical?
                    Brzezinski and I have talked about it and we think it would be useful.” So I
                    said, “Well, I think it would be useful too.” Right away I got a call from
                    Brzezinski with the same message. So I got a small group of people together and
                    we met with Carter at the White House. These were the Democrats, not the
                    Committee on the Present Danger. I found my Democratic colleagues asking really
                    hostile questions to Carter about the last two years and I could see Carter
                    getting hot under the collar. I was disappointed. So I stopped the discussion
                    and I said, “Mr. President, would you excuse me for a moment while I, in your
                    presence, talk to my colleagues?” And out loud I said, “What are we doing here
                    criticizing the President of the United States who invited us to meet with him
                    because he would like our advice on foreign policy questions, and who is
                    pursuing a policy that we agree with now? Let's stop this.” We had a short
                    meeting thereafter which was in a better tone. Carter left and we then continued
                    talking with Mondale and Brzezinski.</p>
                <p>A few months later, on a Friday morning?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Afghanistan was Christmas so it almost had to be in
                        1980.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0093" n="Page0093"/>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: Maybe it was March.</p>
                <p>I got a call from Mondale, “Max, I'd like to see you.” This was not unusual. He
                    would sometimes want to talk over things with me. I said fine. It was a Friday.
                    I said, “I'll be in all next week. Just tell me when you want to meet.” But he
                    said, “I'd like to see you today.” So I said, “I'll walk over.” Our office was
                    then at the Watergate so I walked over to the White House and then to his
                    office. He said, “Max, we had our Friday morning breakfast on foreign policy
                    this morning.” The press had indicated that every Friday morning Carter met with
                    Vance and Defense and the CIA and the Chiefs. And he said, “Your name was
                    proposed, not by me,” he says, “to head up our delegation in Madrid and the
                    President has asked me to talk to you about that.” I've got to first say to you,
                    I did not know what the hell was happening in Madrid or what it meant to go to
                    Madrid and head up a delegation in Madrid. But for the moment that was secondary
                    because I said, “Fritz, you know I can not and do not want a government job.”
                    Mondale said, “I told the president that at the breakfast.” Fritz knew I had
                    turned down all government job opportunities. He then said that “It would only
                    be three months and you don't have to leave your law firm.” So I said, “Look, if
                    it's three months of service that doesn't require me to leave my law firm, then
                    I'd be delighted to do whatever is required of me to do.”</p>
                <p>As we talked a little bit I recognized the Madrid Conference as being a follow up
                    to a conference attended by Arthur Goldberg three years earlier in Belgrade. And
                    I remembered that Goldberg considered it a miserable experience, but that didn't
                    trouble me. Anyhow, after I said yes, Mondale said there's a catch. So I said,
                    “What's the catch?” He said, “Cy Vance offered the job to Bill Scranton, the
                    former governor of Pennsylvania. So I said, “So why do you need me?” and he
                    said, “He offered it to him a couple of months ago and Scranton has not
                    responded; and the president feels we're getting close and he probably won't
                    respond, and he doesn't want to wait. And Vance feels the same way.” Mondale, in
                    the course of this, said, “Cy Vance offers all kinds of jobs to Bill Scranton.
                    They were classmates at Harvard and they're both on the board of Harvard.” It
                    was something like that as I remember. So I said, “Fritz, I came here without a
                    government job, I'm delighted to leave without a government job; if something
                    happens let me know,” and that's how we left it. Weeks went by and I heard
                    nothing, absolutely nothing, which was fine. I didn't tell people about it
                    because there was no job. I don't even think I told my wife about it. I may have
                    told my wife about it; I don't remember now. But it was out of my mind.</p>
                <pb facs="0094" n="Page0094"/>
                <p>After many weeks Fritz called me on the telephone, “Do you remember our
                    conversation?” and I said, “Sure I do.” Well, he said, “Scranton told us
                    yesterday that he would accept the decision.” So I said, “I assumed he did, not
                    having heard from you, so I'm not surprised.” But he said, “The president still
                    wants you to be a co-chairman, to have the both of you, a Democrat and a
                    Republican.” So I said, “Alright. Does Scranton know about this?” He said, “I
                    don't know.” He said to me, “Why don't you go over and talk to Cy Vance about
                    the whole thing.” I knew Cy Vance so I went over and I talked to him and he
                    said, “No, I have not mentioned it to Scranton,” but he said, “the President
                    wants you in there.” It was later explained to me that because of what I did at
                    that earlier meeting with him. He liked what I said and did. It's interesting
                    how the world comes together. But Vance said to me, “Don't worry. Scranton will
                    have no problem with that. He's a lovely person, he's a dear friend, and he'd be
                    delighted to have you as co-chairman.” And then I said, “But, Cy, I've got
                    another problem: this three months business. I can't leave the Firm.” He said,
                    “I know that.” He explained the short three month job and made me a “special”
                    employee. So they arranged to get me a piece of paper which referred to the
                    regulation. So Bill Scranton and I become partners.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about Scranton?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: Scranton and I worked together beautifully. I liked him. I had never
                    met him before. He was easy to work with. The State Department recommended
                    Warren Zimmerman to be our deputy. I never met Warren Zimmerman. Scranton and I
                    were both impressed with him so we took him in as our deputy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Warren and I were both Serbian specialists and we served
                        in Belgrade together. He was a young officer and I was a mid-grade
                        officer.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: Okay.</p>
                <p>Scranton and I learned from the State Department that we had problems on the Hill
                    (Capitol Hill). There was a Commission on the Helsinki Final Act and there was
                    tension between the Commission and the State Department, and had been for a few
                    years. Dante Fascell was the chairman of the commission; I knew Dante well. The
                    staff director was Spencer Oliver. His father was a lobbyist at the AF of L, a
                    friend of mine, and indeed; I remember his father asking me if he could use my
                    name with Dante Fascell because he was applying for the job. He could use
                    Humphrey's name, too. So I went to see him and Dante Fascell. Both did not trust
                    the State Department.</p>
                <pb facs="0095" n="Page0095"/>
                <p>Anyhow, I worked out a deal with Fascell. He wanted Spencer to be our deputy. I
                    said: “Dante, the State Department recommended Warren Zimmerman. I think our
                    deputy ought to be somebody in the State Department to help with cables and all
                    the rest, but I'll be glad to make him a kind of staff director. I could do this
                    because Scranton authorized me to figure out any way to do it. So I worked out a
                    deal. I then said to him, “I want you to be honorary vice chairman and I want
                    Senator Pell,” who was the head of the Senate group, “to be honorary vice
                    chairman.” They would be honored; they agreed.</p>
                <p>Two weeks later, on a Friday, Scranton called me on the phone and said, “Max, I
                    just want you to know that I went in to see the President this morning and I
                    withdrew from Madrid.” I said, “Bill, that's crazy. Why did you do that?” and he
                    said, “because of my health.” He said, “It's getting bad and I shouldn't be
                    doing this.” I don't know if he had lung problems or what. So I said, “Bill,
                    you're co-chairman. One of the advantages of co-chairman is that if you're not
                    well and you want to stay in Washington, I will be there; and it's only three
                    months.” He said, “I knew you would say that, which is why I didn't talk to you
                    first,” which was a complimentary thing to say. Then I heard from Mondale and
                    Vance and Brzezinski that they didn't want to have another co-chairman; I would
                    be the chairman. I said fine. Then as we got close to the preparatory meetings
                    beginning in September of 1980 I got a call from Brzezinski: “Max, much to our
                    surprise, the President has just appointed Griffin Bell as co-chairman with
                    you.” This was the former attorney general who had just a few months earlier
                    resigned. He said, “I'm sorry.” I said, “Look, I'd be honored to serve with
                    Griffin Bell.” I never met him, but he was the attorney general of the United
                    States. So I said, “That's not a problem.” Brzezinski said to me, “I think maybe
                    you ought to call Clinton Bell and talk to him about what you're doing and what
                    his job is.” So I called Bell, who very gruffly on the phone said, “Yeah, what
                    the hell is this thing that the President wants me to take?” - he didn't say he
                    took it. So I said, “Well, I'll come down to Atlanta, judge, and we'll talk
                    about it.”</p>
                <p>So I went down to Atlanta and spent a few hours with him, most of which he told
                    me was that he didn't want the job; he didn't like the job. He had no interest
                    in going overseas. He has no time; he's too busy with his law practice etc?; I
                    kept hearing these same speeches. So I finally said to him, “Judge, I'll be
                    there for the preparatory meetings. Why don't you come for the opening day? You
                    don't have to be at the preparatory meetings at all. The opening day is in
                    November. Why don't you come for the opening day? If you want to come for the
                    preparatory meeting or any part of it, come, and then get a feel of the meeting
                    and whatever you want to do is fine, as far as I'm concerned.” I then said, “We
                    had to go up to the Senate for hearings because we both were to have
                    ambassadorial titles.” He said, “I won't take the job” after we got it all
                    worked out. And I said, “Why not?” “I will never appear before a congressional
                    committee again.”</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0096" n="Page0096"/>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: Embarrassed because of a club he belonged to.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh. And his wife owned the club, coming out of Georgia at
                        that time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: And he said, “My wife won't let me. I won't do it.” So I figured
                    something out under which he did not have to appear before a committee.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, I read the Helsinki Final Act to prepare for the meeting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is a good place, I think, to explain what was the
                        issue in that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: Okay. The Soviet Union, in the 1950s, had proposed a European security
                    conference. As I think about it, their purpose at the time was twofold. One,
                    there were no boundaries in Europe, and no peace treaty - after the Second World
                    War. So they wanted an agency that would legitimize those boundaries. Secondly,
                    they wanted an all European conference as a way of subtly undermining NATO
                    (North Atlantic Treaty Organization). The United States was not a part of
                    Europe. The European West resisted that proposal by the Soviets in the 1950s
                    because they saw that it meant separating and undermining NATO and they would
                    have no part of it. Then Nixon became President with his detente. The West in
                    Europe saw the United States getting closer to the Soviet Union and said to
                    themselves, 'well, we maybe have a green light to get closer as well.' The
                    United States agreed somehow to this and discussions began, I think in 1972 or
                    '71, about how to organize this conference. Fortunately, and since I was not a
                    part of this I do not know whether the idea of introducing human rights and
                    broader relationships into what was to be a security conference, whether that
                    came from the West in Europe or whether it came from the United States. I did
                    not know that. I've heard both stories, so I'm assuming they both agreed that
                    this is what had to be.</p>
                <p>In any event, by 1975 they had an agreement, which was called the Helsinki Final
                    Act because it was signed in Helsinki, Finland. It was an agreement that had in
                    effect three fundamental sections or baskets, one of which was a security basket
                    which provided for military, confidence-building measures among the thirty-five
                    members. Apparently there were thirty-three European countries. I never knew
                    there were, but if you count Luxembourg and Monaco?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And Lichtenstein and San Marino, I guess.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0097" n="Page0097"/>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: It comes to thirty-three, plus the United States and Canada. So the
                    Russians accepted those modifications. The one basket was security oriented; the
                    second was an economic basket among the thirty-five so as to help produce
                    cooperation; and thirdly was the humanitarian - freedom of religion, freedom of
                    human rights, freedom of travel, all broadly stated and without specifics.</p>
                <p>I also learned that when Gerald Ford signed that agreement in Helsinki he did so
                    against the advice of his secretary of state. I make that statement because I
                    have reason to believe that's probably correct, but I'm not sure. I'll tell you
                    why I'm not sure in a moment. But it certainly was against the advice of his
                    party and many Republican members in the Congress. But he decided to sign it and
                    he signed it. That agreement also provided that this should be a process, which
                    meant that the thirty-five countries should meet periodically to review matters.
                    The first such review meeting took place in 1977 in Belgrade and Arthur Goldberg
                    was chosen to head up the American delegation for that. If you're interested, I
                    will later tell you how that happened because I know how it happened.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well why don't you talk about that?</hi>

                <p>KAMPELMAN: Right now?</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: Humphrey, after a meeting with Carter called me on the telephone.</p>
                <p>He had developed a good relationship with Carter. He called me on the telephone
                    in my law office and he says, “I've just left the president” - that was Carter -
                    “and I told the president that if he's going to involve himself so deeply into
                    the Israeli-Middle East question” - this was UN Security Council Resolution 242
                    - “he ought to talk to Arthur Goldberg,” who was our ambassador at the United
                    Nations at that time and who was instrumental in the passage of Security Council
                    Resolution 242. Carter liked the idea. Humphrey to me: “Would you call Arthur
                    and warn Arthur that he is going to get a call from President Carter? I found
                    him at his farm. I told him, “You're going to get a call from the President.” He
                    got a call from the President; he went to see the President. The President was
                    impressed. The President said, “I want you to be my mid-East negotiator.” Arthur
                    agreed to be the mid-East negotiator. Arthur left the president's office and
                    looked for Brzezinski. When he saw Brzezinski he said, “I've just been made the
                    mid-East negotiator. You and I should talk.” Brzezinski was appalled; he had no
                    knowledge of this. They talked about it. Goldberg left; Brzezinski called Cy
                    Vance, “What do you know about it?” Cy Vance was appalled. He knew nothing about
                    it. They both agreed quietly they've got to derail this. It took them a few
                    weeks to figure out how to derail it.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0098" n="Page0098"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was their problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: I'm not sure I know what their problem was. I think their problem was
                    the fact that Arthur, as UN ambassador, was an independent soul and would take
                    no instructions from anybody other than the President of the United States. This
                    was Goldberg; I knew him well and this is the way he is. In an event, Zbig and
                    Vance felt they had to derail the Carter action. They apparently persuaded
                    Carter and agreed to tell Goldberg that the East-West problem needed his
                    legislation and was now more urgent than the Middle-East.</p>
                <p>The problem with it was that the State Department had already selected somebody,
                    a career officer, to head up our delegation in Belgrade, a very capable career
                    fellow whose name escapes me for the moment. And his name had been sent up to
                    the Senate already for the Belgrade meeting. So they had to get themselves out
                    of that mess. Be that as it may, Arthur's experience in Belgrade was terrible.
                    I'm surprised, but for whatever reason Arthur told me that, it was the most
                    miserable political experience of his life.</p>
                <p>In any event, I read the Helsinki Final Act and I was rather impressed with it;
                    and I think I should say here what went through my mind. I used to teach. Did I
                    talk to you about the Myrdahl book?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, you did.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: That's what I thought. What went through my mind was the Myrdahl book
                    and statements, that in America what impresses him is our virtual national
                    agreement on what “ought” to be and we were moving the 'is' to the 'ought'
                    steadily. I looked upon the Helsinki Final Act as the 'ought' of relationships
                    signed by all of Europe. Now, the Russians didn't think anybody would hold them
                    accountable and secondly, they wanted to have security and their boundaries
                    recognized. But to me it was an 'ought' and if all of Europe agreed to an
                    'ought.' We had a right to judge the 'is' and to help move the 'is' to the
                    'ought.'</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Henry Kissinger denigrated this accord. I've interviewed
                        George Vest, who was working on this.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: George was superb at this.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But he was saying that he would hear from the Swedes, who
                        heard from the East Germans, who were hearing from the Soviets, that this
                        whole negotiation was a bunch of nonsense because Henry was off on arms
                        control; and this was nothing.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0099" n="Page0099"/>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: Let me say to you that George Vest is the fellow who put it together
                    for the United States and he helped me because he was still in the State
                    Department?</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was head of European Affairs, one or the other. Head of

                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: I did not come into this job in any way hostile, on the contrary. I
                    came in generally trying to get along and George Vest was a tremendous help to
                    me in giving me the background and the history. I'm jumping a little bit, but
                    Bill Clinton gave me the Presidential Medal of Freedom for this work.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm looking at it here. It's very impressive.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: There was a little get-together before the ceremony. I was there with
                    my family. President Gerald Ford was getting it the same day. Gerald Ford came
                    into the room before the ceremony. He saw me, he came over to me and he said,
                    “Max, I'm glad you're here. I want to thank you.” I said, “Mr. President, what
                    are you thanking me for?” He says, “When I signed the Helsinki Final Act my
                    party opposed me, my secretary of state opposed me; you have now made me look
                    good in history,” which was an interesting comment, but which is why I could say
                    earlier that the Secretary of State was not in favor of the signing. I got that
                    from the president, from Gerald Ford.</p>
                <p>Incidentally, I guess I should say this because it's?after it was clear that I
                    had been chosen to head up the Madrid meeting, my secretary received a phone
                    call from Henry Kissinger's secretary; he was then at CSIS (Center for Strategic
                    and International Studies). His secretary said to my secretary, “Dr. Kissinger
                    thinks it's time for him and Mr. Kampelman to have breakfast again.” She said to
                    me and she says, “I never knew you had breakfast with the secretary of state.” I
                    know him of course, but I said, “I don't think we have had breakfast ever.” But
                    that was his way of arranging a meeting. Henry was a friend of mine - he said,
                    “Max, don't take the job. It's awful. It's all a Soviet plot. You know better
                    than that. Don't take it.” I took it, but I'm just telling you here that I went
                    in, therefore, and I knew Arthur had problems with our allies, as well as with
                    the other side. So I told the State Department that I would like to make a tour
                    to some of our allies in Europe before the meeting, and I did.</p>
                <pb facs="0100" n="Page0100"/>
                <p>One of the great problems that Goldberg faced was the fact that he mentioned the
                    names - and I think it was six victims of Soviet repression - at the Belgrade
                    meeting, asking for their release. This was a source of controversy. I do not
                    know why it was a source of controversy, but it was even among our allies. I was
                    convinced that there was no way I was going to go to Madrid without mentioning
                    the names, and without being actively anti-Soviet because their 'is' was very
                    far from the 'ought.' And I told this to the State Department and George Vest
                    agreed with me. I had no problems. Brzezinski agreed with me. I had no
                    problems.</p>
                <p>I went to Germany and met with Genscher. I explained to him that I want to have
                    good relations; I want there to be a NATO caucus; we want to be part of it, and
                    we wanted to have a united western front. And I said I know this is a
                    controversy, naming names, but there's no way I'm not going to mention names.
                    I'm going to be mentioning names. He said to me, “We received 50,000 Germans out
                    of the Soviet Union last year, quietly and without any noise or embarrassment to
                    the Soviets-” (End of tape)</p>
                <p>He said that time he come to the United States. He sees these signs: 'Save Soviet
                    Jews,' That was not his way of doing things. So I said, “Minister, I respect it.
                    I want you to know at the outset that I know you received 50,000 Germans quietly
                    last year; it so happens that last year 50,000 Jews were released also from the
                    Soviet Union and we were not quiet.” “But,” I said, “I do not want to be part of
                    anything that will keep one single German in the Soviet Union.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Are we talking about Germans? We're not talking about
                        Germans, are we?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: Germans apparently from the Soviet Union.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There was a German group that lived in Ukraine back
                        in...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: Well, whatever. He just said, “We got 50,000 Germans out of the Soviet
                    Union.”</p>
                <p>But I said, “You know, let's think of ourselves and the NATO caucus as an
                    orchestra. In an orchestra you have a flute that plays softly, you've got a
                    saxophone that blares out at times, sometimes the piano is soft; sometimes the
                    piano is loud.” I said, “But we play music together. Let's look upon our Madrid
                    experience as an orchestra. We're going to blow the horn. If you don't want to
                    blow the horn, you do it your way. But let's make music together, but we must
                    have a caucus.” Why do I mention this? Because later, after Shultz became
                    Secretary of State and the Madrid meeting was still going on, Shultz said to me,
                    “Genscher keeps talking to me about you and the orchestra. What is that all
                    about?” And I told him. Genscher liked our approach and we became friends. We
                    also visited during the Madrid meetings.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0101" n="Page0101"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was the long-term head of the Free German Party.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: He was the foreign minister for many years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was the foreign minister for many years under various
                        regimes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: The German ambassador to Madrid, whose name was Jorge Kastl, became a
                    close friend of mine. It started with Genscher telling him to work closely with
                    me, but it ended with our developing a close friendship and I'm still in touch
                    with him and his wife. In our planning I always involved the Germans, and Kastl,
                    who had been an experienced ambassador was very helpful to me during the whole
                    Madrid meetings.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You named your delegation; it started out with you and
                        Scranton - a Democrat and a Republican and all. Your delegation became sort
                        of a Democratic delegation. You know, the people would orientation that way.
                        Was this a problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: No, let me just say as far as our delegation was concerned the staff
                    included people from State, as well as the Congressional staff. I assumed the
                    Congressional staff was democratic because they were working for Dante Fascell.
                    I had no idea what the politics of the State Department group was. But Warren
                    was my deputy. I never asked his politics. He was a professional diplomat, and
                    the Secretary of our delegation was also a professional diplomat. I had no
                    knowledge of what his politics were. But I was a Democrat, openly known.</p>
                <p>When the Madrid meeting temporarily adjourned before Christmas, Carter had been
                    defeated that previous month. So I submitted my resignation, as every ambassador
                    would do. Indeed, the NATO ministers who were now friends of mine, because from
                    September until Christmas we worked as a team, and I made a lot of friends; gave
                    me a farewell party. I submitted my resignation and in early January I received
                    a telephone call from Al Haig, who was the new Secretary of State, not yet in
                    office, saying, “Max, I talked to the President. The President would like to
                    have you continue.” I said, “I'm a Democrat, Al.” He said, “He knows and I know
                    that. We want you to continue. I know what you're doing in Madrid; I'd like you
                    to continue to do it in Madrid.” I received a similar call from Jeane
                    Kirkpatrick, whose husband was my faculty advisor and who was a good friend of
                    mine, and she said, “Max, the president has asked me to go to the United Nations
                    and I happened to be at a meeting where your name came up in connection with the
                    Madrid [meetings], and I put my two cents in that I'd like to see you?”</p>
                <p>I don't know if I ever went into how I first met Reagan, but at some point we
                    should.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0102" n="Page0102"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well why don't we talk about it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: At some point we should but let me just finish up this theme here. I
                    agreed to continue in the job. I said it's more than three months and I have a
                    problem. I wanted another letter. I wanted to know whether I'm still a special
                    government employee. So I received another letter saying the job has been
                    designated as such and therefore anybody who holds the job can enjoy its
                    benefits. I think they stretched the point. But the fact of the matter is I
                    needed a letter to protect myself on the process; and I got the letter, even
                    though they stretched the point. So we had a good laugh about the politics.
                    Reagan knew I was a Democrat, and I'll go into my relationship with him in a few
                    moments, but that was never a problem. I should also add here that I had decided
                    not to receive a salary other than expenses. During Madrid's three months, other
                    than expenses, I continued without salary again.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As you went into these negotiations in Madrid, had this
                        become a political matter? I mean sort of the right wing of the Republican
                        Party saying this was a sell out to the Soviet Union and that sort of
                        thing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: No.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's interesting.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: No, it was not. First of all, because immediately as Reagan was sworn
                    into office they appointed me to continue in the job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But was there any talk anywhere within?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: No. I had no political problems and no problems with the career folk.
                    Our country ambassador was Terence Todman. I had reason to know that Goldberg
                    and Eagleburger, who was the ambassador in Belgrade, were at loggerheads. So
                    what I did is I went to see Terry Todman the first day I was there because our
                    officers were initially at the embassy - and I went to see Terry. I said, “I
                    understand that at the previous meeting Goldberg and Eagleburger had their
                    problems. I'd like you to become a vice chairman of my delegation. You're always
                    welcome to attend any or all of the sessions, and I'll keep you fully informed,”
                    and he was delighted. Terry and I continue to be friends.</p>
                <pb facs="0103" n="Page0103"/>
                <p>I also said to Fascell that every Congressional member of his Commission should
                    consider themselves to be honorary members of our delegation, and any time they
                    wanted to come out to Madrid I would have them sitting in at the meetings. These
                    were Democrats and Republicans. Even though everybody knew I was a Democrat, the
                    meetings were not partisan meetings. We had a good relationship.</p>
                <p>I talked earlier about a NATO caucus. Warren Zimmerman knew the fellow - this was
                    now the preparatory meeting, which began in September; the main meeting began in
                    November - who was heading up the British delegation, so I met him before we
                    began. Warren and I said to him, “Look, we want to do something about the NATO
                    caucus.” He said, “I don't think there's going to be a NATO caucus.” He
                    explained, “That sour taste in Belgrade led the Ten European Community to move
                    in. We're going to have regular meetings for the Ten. We're going to have
                    loyalty problems.” But he said, “If you want a NATO Caucus let's see what we can
                    do.” He wanted to cooperate with us. He said, “Let me call a meeting of all of
                    the NATO group at the United Kingdom embassy and we'll talk about it.” So he
                    called a meeting and he explained right after UK comes U.S., so you may want to
                    call a meeting after the UK meeting, although I don't know if the French will
                    attend or how it will be.” Anyhow, we met at the UK. I notified the NATO members
                    that I was scheduled to meet the Soviet delegation head the next day at lunch. I
                    would cancel the lunch if they wanted me to cancel. If not, I proposed a second
                    NATO caucus meeting the next evening at the U.S. Embassy at which I would report
                    on my meeting with the Soviets. They agreed unanimously. The French also showed
                    up.</p>
                <p>Now a word about that meeting with the Soviets; the Romanian ambassador to our
                    meeting was Dactu, a professor. He had come to Washington before the meeting. I
                    didn't have an office in the State Department; I kept my law office. The State
                    Department thought I ought to meet him, so I met him. Jean Dactu apparently had
                    been a teacher and then was a diplomat. I found he spoke English when we met. It
                    was a pleasant session. On the eve of Madrid, I told our State Department to
                    tell our ambassador in Spain that when Dactu comes to Madrid I'd like to meet
                    him on the first day for lunch, since I didn't think I would know anybody else
                    there. He agreed and asked could he bring his delegation of two more, and I said
                    yes. So the three of them came and Warren and I met with them. We chatted,
                    during the course of which he said, “Would you be willing to speak on Romanian
                    television?” I said I'd be delighted. At the end of the lunch he said to me,
                    “You know, I'm going to have to tell uncle about this lunch.” So I said, “Mr.
                    Ambassador, I had every expectation that you would discuss this with the Soviets
                    and you should. Everything I've said to you I'd be delighted to say to
                    anybody.”</p>
                <pb facs="0104" n="Page0104"/>
                <p>He called me that afternoon and I knew by then that the man who was going to head
                    up the Madrid preparatory meeting was their country ambassador, a man who later
                    their U.S. ambassador, Dubinin. Dactu said, “I reported to Ambassador Dubinin
                    and he says that he would very much like to meet with you.” After Afghanistan,
                    the President had issued a policy that no American would officially meet with a
                    Soviet official. Before I went to Madrid I said to Brzezinski, and to the
                    President, and to Vance - we were in a meeting - that I didn't see how I could
                    possibly attend a meeting without talking to every delegation. There were two
                    political issues of sensitivity - this Afghanistan reason was one and the other
                    was a military suggestion that the French were pushing. We talked about both and
                    the President said, “We have to leave that up to your judgment.”</p>
                <p>So I said to Dactu, “Well, I'd be delighted to meet with Ambassador Dubinin.” He
                    was pleased. He said, “You know, no American has met with a Russian.” But I said
                    I'd be delighted to meet with him. I also said, “Tell me where he wants me to
                    meet him.” He called me back a half hour later and he said, “Ambassador Dubinin
                    would like you to tell him where to meet for lunch.” I thought a minute and I
                    said, “This is a game he's playing?this is my first day in Madrid. You take me
                    two blocks away and I'll get lost. I don't know Madrid. I've never been in
                    Madrid. He's the ambassador in Madrid. He should be deciding where we're going
                    to eat. He doesn't want to do that because he wants me to issue the invitation
                    and he wants everybody to know that.” I continued, “That's fine. Let's have it
                    in my hotel suite and let everybody know that I invited him to have lunch,”
                    which is exactly what happened. I had the authority to meet with him at my
                    discretion, but I didn't give a damn and it served my purposes at the NATO
                    caucus; although I hadn't planned it, a lot of these things just happened.</p>
                <p>He came with his number two, who I learned from Warren, he was a KGB general and
                    was running the delegation. Warren and I met with the two of them in my suite at
                    the hotel. It lasted until nearly four o'clock and I offered him a deal. I said,
                    “Look, this is a preparatory meeting. You and I are going to fight at the
                    meeting constantly and I'd like to level with you.” I said, “You know what I
                    think of your government,” and I said, “I have no use for your system and I'm
                    going to say so.” But, I said, “We have a preparatory meeting now; we had
                    Belgrade. We don't think those rules were great; you may not think those rules
                    were great. Let's agree to continue with Belgrade, whatever those rules are.
                    Rules are not important. Let's just get through with it in three of four days
                    and get it done and prepare ammunition for the main meeting where we can fight
                    each other.” He said he wanted to think about it. He never agreed to that, with
                    the result that the preparatory meeting where they took a licking began in
                    September and lasted to the opening day of the session in November. We couldn't
                    agree, but he took a licking. In any event, that was that and then I reported to
                    NATO.</p>
                <pb facs="0105" n="Page0105"/>
                <p>The next day Warren called me. The general had telephoned him - Sergei Kondrashev
                    was the name - and he said they had a good luncheon and they would now like to
                    reciprocate by inviting us to dinner, or for lunch; I don't remember. I said,
                    “Warren, you tell them that the next days are Jewish high holidays and I intend
                    to go to the synagogue, and so if he wants to talk to me he's got to wait until
                    after the Jewish high holidays.” And then I said to Warren, “And, Warren, I
                    don't mind letting our allies know that I've said no and why I've said no.” So
                    Warren passed it along, which stood me in good stead anyhow, and delivered a
                    message. So that's the NATO caucus. We met regularly and frequently. Before the
                    opening day in November I went to the Swedish ambassador - they were part of a
                    neutral and unaligned caucus - and said: “I don't want to embarrass you in any
                    way but I'm going to mention Carl Wallenberg.” I said, “He's been made an
                    honorary citizen by the Congress and I don't want to embarrass you, he was a
                    Swedish citizen, but I want you to know I'm going to do it and I think you may
                    want to tell your government that I'm going to mention him as a victim of Soviet
                    repression.” He said thank you and then on the opening day he came to me and
                    said, “I'd like you to listen attentively to what my minister is saying,” and
                    the minister mentioned Raoul Wallenberg. In Belgrade they fought naming names,
                    but he mentioned Wallenberg in Madrid, as did many other countries.</p>
                <p>At the preparatory meetings the staff of the Commission was superb. They were
                    very helpful to me. It was a great staff. They had the Belgrade experience. I
                    used to carry a briefcase with data with me that I could always pull up. I
                    recall one exchange between us and NATO with the Soviet Bloc. I recall beginning
                    to compare what the Soviet Bloc said in Belgrade (date given to me by the
                    Commission staff) and the contrary position they were now taking.</p>
                <p>The Hungarian was sitting across from me. I had a quotation of the Hungarian who
                    was in Belgrade and he knew it. I looked at him and took out a piece of paper.
                    He was getting nervous; and I made a decision right on the moment that I was not
                    going to read his statement, but I will talk about the Warsaw Pact and embarrass
                    them as a whole, which I did, and they were embarrassed. I arrived at my hotel
                    that night to find a case of Hungarian wine, no note. The next morning I came
                    into the meeting and went straight to the Hungarian, and with a sober, somber
                    face I said, “You've caused me great difficulty, Mr. Ambassador.” I said, “We
                    have a rule in the State Department that we can not accept any gifts that we can
                    not consume within twelve hours. It was a very difficult night for me.” And he
                    brightened. Obviously we became friends.</p>

                <p>KAMPELMAN: Let me finish that story. The Romanian asked me to be on television.
                    Warren worked out a time for me to be on television that day or a few days
                    later, I don't remember. I was interviewed on Romanian television and I said how
                    pleased I was to be speaking to the people of Romania because both of my parents
                    were born in Romania. He was very excited!. “Where?” So I told him and I said,
                    “Of course. It was part of Romania when they were born, it's now, unfortunately,
                    a part of the Soviet Union.” And then we had a good interview about the meeting.
                    Two days later Dactu came to me and asked, “What did you say on Romanian
                    television?” I said, “I don't know. I just tried to be polite.” “Well, he said,
                    “my President is all excited about what you said. He wants you to come to
                    Romania to meet with him.” I said, “Look, I know why he wants to talk to me.”
                    One of the items Dactu and I talked about at our meeting, on the opening was
                    that he had instructions to get the next follow up meeting in Bucharest, and I
                    said to him, “We will oppose it. You haven't earned it.” And I said, “I have no
                    problem meeting a neutral country or a western country, but we will not go to a
                    Warsaw Pact country. My department will not agree.” So I said to Dactu, “He
                    wants to see me because he wants to push me to change my mind about the next
                    follow up meeting.” He said, “Well I don't know why he wants to see you.” I did
                    not respond to the invitation.</p>
                <p>I received another visit a few days later: “My President wants to see you.”
                    Finally, about a month later the State Department called me, “Max, can you go to
                    Romania?” I said, “Why?” “Well,” they said, “because Dactu wants to talk to
                    you.” I said, “Do you want me to go to Romania?” They said, “Yes, we want you to
                    go to Romania.” So I took a plane at government expense and I went to Romania.
                    We spent three hours together. He never once raised the question of the next
                    meeting of the CSCE. I was wrong. We talked about the place where my parents
                    were born and during the course of it he talked about the Soviet Union. I told
                    him what we were going to do in Madrid; I told him I was going to criticize his
                    government also. He brought me to a map on the wall and he pointed to the
                    boundary between Romania and the Soviet Union and he said, “There are 100,000
                    Soviet troops on the Soviet side of that boundary. Washington has to realize
                    what I face,” which was an interesting comment and I passed it, of course, on to
                    Washington.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's very oppressive government...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: Well, I found him impressive.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oppressive.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0107" n="Page0107"/>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: Oh! But he was impressive?but it was an oppressive regime and I said
                    so. But I want to say to you two things: he made it possible for me and my wife
                    to visit that area where my parents were born and that was to fly me from
                    Bucharest to the boundary with the Soviet Ukraine and I made arrangements with
                    the KGB general to be met there and to have somebody take me into the city. Let
                    me add here that after three years, as we're ending the CSCE meeting in Madrid,
                    we still have a small but significant difference of opinion on the final
                    statement. I persuaded the neutrals to come in with a proposal we could accept.
                    The neutrals agreed to put it in as their compromise. The Russians said they
                    don't accept it. Dactu stood up and said, “At the instructions of my president,
                    my government's position is in favor of the neutral and non-aligned proposal.”
                    People in the State Department told me they didn't know of any other instance
                    where Rumanians deviated from the Moscow line.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, Ceausescu was a very personable person. I mean not
                        personally a nice guy, but?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: No. He was a butcher.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was a butcher, but I mean he was a person who made up

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You thought you might mention how you met Ronald
                        Reagan.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: Did I not do that yet?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You haven't done that yet.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: Okay.</p>
                <p>I mentioned, I believe, that I was active in the organization of the Committee on
                    the Present Danger. This was a group of no more than 100 and I was on the
                    executive committee. One of the 100 was Ronald Reagan. I had never met the man;
                    I don't even know if I ever saw any of the movies that he was in. One of his
                    friends was on our executive committee - a man who later became the first
                    national security adviser under his administration, Dick Allen. Allen indicated
                    at our executive committee meetings - he was always talking about Reagan - that
                    he was going to help Reagan move to the presidency.</p>
                <pb facs="0108" n="Page0108"/>
                <p>I was in private life, of course, and I was chairman of the American Friends of
                    the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, as well as a board member of the Hebrew
                    University of Jerusalem. This involved me in life in Israel and education.
                    Carter was president. You may remember a time was reached when Carter and Vance
                    decided to bring Russia into the Middle East. I thought that was terrible. The
                    Soviet Union was not qualified to do it and would not be impartial. A thought
                    occurred to me and I went to Dick Allen after one of our executive committee
                    meetings and I explained that I did not like what Carter was doing about the
                    Middle East in bringing the Soviet Union in, and that I wanted somehow to
                    communicate the fact that Carter should not believe that the Jewish vote is
                    always in his pocket. I explained my University connection and that we have an
                    annual fundraiser in Palm Beach, Florida, where wealthy people go for the
                    winter.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Kennedys go there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: Sure. The Kennedys go there. And I was frank with him. I said, “What
                    do you think if I invite Ronald Reagan to be the speaker at that annual
                    fundraising dinner?” I said, “There will be a lot of Republican Jews there, too”
                    - Max Fischer was a big Republican fundraiser and active in the Jewish community
                    - and I told Allen why I wanted Reagan there. He said, “I'll have to talk to the
                    governor about it.” A few days later he called me and said, “I talked to the
                    governor; he said yes, he'll be pleased to do that,” - He knew it couldn't be a
                    political speech because I made that clear to Allen, that we didn't want to get
                    involved in the politics of it; and he said that Reagan said yes on condition
                    that a fellow committee member will be there and sit next to him on the dais and
                    brief him so that he knows who the people are. I said, “Well, I intended to be
                    there,” as the chairman and I'll be glad to sit next to him. I reaffirmed the
                    fact that of course it won't be a political speech; and he said, “No, as a
                    matter of fact, the governor told me that every year he buys Israeli bonds,”
                    which I did not know.</p>
                <p>At the dinner, I sat next to the man and we chatted. He wanted to know about me;
                    We'd never met. He wanted to have somebody, even though he didn't know me, that
                    he could talk to. When he found out my relationship with Hubert Humphrey, his
                    eyes lit up and said, “Hubert is one of my best friends,” which I had no idea.
                    And he said, “As a matter of fact, when he comes to northern California I always
                    insist that he stay at the executive mansion with Nancy and me.” This is new to
                    me. Then he said to me, “When I was president of the Screen Actors Guild Hubert
                    was very helpful to me and we've been friends ever since.” So we spent the
                    evening talking about Humphrey, when we could talk, because of speeches; he told
                    me a lot about the Screen Actors Guild and his activities there. He also said he
                    spoke in Minneapolis for Humphrey as Senator in 1948. So we got along quite well
                    with each other. He made a splendid speech, as a matter of fact. That's how I
                    met him. I never saw him before.</p>
                <pb facs="0109" n="Page0109"/>
                <p>This becomes relevant. I was in Madrid appointed by Carter. Carter was defeated
                    and I submitted my resignation as every political ambassador did. I received a
                    call from the new Secretary of State, Al Haig, whom I knew when he was with
                    Nixon as chief of staff, and then he was around. As a matter of fact, I met with
                    him once when he was the head of NATO in Europe. Haig said, “The President and I
                    would like you to continue in Madrid.” I received a call from Jeane Kirkpatrick:
                    “The president wants you to continue in Madrid.” So I said, “I'll be glad to
                    continue in Madrid.” I have a feeling that our exchange in Florida may have
                    contributed to this appointment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm sure it did.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: I'm sure it did, although I knew Al Haig - as a matter of fact, I
                    introduced Al Haig at a meeting in Europe; Jeane Kirkpatrick and I were friends;
                    her husband was my faculty advisor at the University of Minnesota. She was a
                    strong Humphrey supporter when Humphrey ran for president. So that's how I ended
                    up continuing into the Republican administration. I developed a splendid
                    relationship with the President. He wanted to talk to me and we chatted, and,
                    for example, to give you an illustration of this - it's never been publicized -
                    I really had the Soviets on the run in Madrid; there's no question about that,
                    and I had it without any polemics because I'm not a polemical fellow. So we had
                    really quite an anti-Soviet, anti-repression movement going that was quite
                    effective, and it was all over the European press because I was on radio a lot.
                    Reagan liked this.</p>
                <p>At one point George Shultz became Secretary of State.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Finish this because we want to go back to the Madrid
                        conference.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: I had not known Shultz when he was in the cabinet in Washington. He
                    was very active, but I never knew him. I was not a Republican and I was not
                    active in the government. He called me when he became secretary of state. I
                    congratulated him on his new appointment and I said to him, “Is there anything I
                    can do to be helpful?” and he said he wanted me to come by and chat when I'm in
                    Washington.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were back in your law office by this time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: No, I was in Madrid still.</p>
                <pb facs="0110" n="Page0110"/>
                <p>Why did he call me? Carter became President in January of '77. In December of '76
                    I got a phone call from Walter Wriston, the president and chairman of the board
                    of Citibank; he was a very distinguished businessman. I had met him as a lawyer;
                    I was negotiating with him at one point. We had not become friends, but we had
                    become acquaintances. He called me on the telephone and he said he'd like to see
                    me.</p>
                <p>Our business relationship was brief, but pleasant, and he felt free to call me.
                    He said, “Look, one of our clients is ARAMCO (Arabian-American Oil Company),
                    which is the Saudi Arabian oil company; and he said, “The president of ARAMCO
                    has asked me to see if I can bring him together with the new Carter people.” And
                    he said, “You're a Democrat and I'm wondering if you have any thoughts about
                    this.” I said I had met Carter, but I didn't know him - “do you know why ARAMCO
                    wants to?” and he says, “I don't know; he didn't tell me.” Well, I said, “I
                    think I know why, and that has to do with the legislation that was the subject
                    of a debate between Carter and Ford.” That was the legislation before Congress
                    that no American company could participate in the Arab boycott of Israel. There
                    was a proposal in Congress which failed after a sharp debate, saying that any
                    company that cooperated with that boycott was itself guilty of violating
                    American law, and Carter had said in the debate that he was in favor of that
                    legislation. So I said, “I think that's what they're concerned about.” So I
                    said, “Look, the new national security adviser is going to be Brzezinski. I know
                    Brzezinski.” He was, in fact, a friend of mine and a strong supporter of
                    Humphrey. So I said, “If you'd like, I'll make arrangements for Brzezinski to
                    meet with your client,” because I wanted to be helpful there. He called me up
                    and he says they'd like to do that. Anyhow, the meeting took place.</p>
                <p>I wasn't there; I didn't hear anything further about it, but Wriston called me on
                    the telephone and he said, “You were right. That's what they wanted to talk
                    about.” And he said, “You know, I wasn't that familiar with this piece of
                    legislation. Can we do anything to help here?” I said, “Well, what do you have
                    in mind?” “Well,” he says, “it seems to me, and it seems to ARAMCO, that we
                    shouldn't have this struggle next year and that we ought to come up with
                    something.” So he and I agreed that I would bring together the leaders of the
                    Anti-Defamation League who were active in this fight. He would bring together
                    the Business Roundtable, which ARAMCO was a part of.</p>
                <pb facs="0111" n="Page0111"/>
                <p>So we had a meeting in the boardroom of Chase Manhattan. As I went into that
                    boardroom meeting I kept thinking - I looked around and saw who was there, and
                    was. Here was the power of American business - the president of General Motors;
                    the president of General Electric; the president of ARAMCO; the president of the
                    Federated Stores; the president of EXXON; the head of Dupont. There were five of
                    us from the Anti-Defamation League. We had a wonderful few hours of discussion
                    where the Anti-Defamation League people presented their arguments, which were
                    presented well. And George Shultz was there as the president of Bechtel. That's
                    why I'm telling you the story. Out of this came an agreement that they would
                    appoint a couple of people and we would appoint a few people - lawyers - and try
                    to see if we could come up with a compromise. And I was part of that process.
                    They both asked me if I would chair the process. We did, and we came up with a
                    solution which was practically unanimous supporters in both the House and the
                    Senate. It solved the problem, but the negotiations were tough.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you recall more or less how it fell out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: Well, it really carried out the purposes with reasonable protection
                    for the businesses. It called for proper procedures. It's still the law. It's
                    still being observed.</p>
                <p>Obviously we got in touch with the White House and the Congress - Stu Eisenstadt,
                    a friend of mine, was in charge of domestic affairs for the Carter White House -
                    and I told Stu what was happening, I kept him informed. Meanwhile, occasionally
                    we would come to insoluble problems in negotiations. As a matter of fact, at one
                    point I was on vacation - I had been to all the meetings, but we had a little
                    place in the Virgin Islands and my wife and I and our five kids were there. I
                    recall receiving a call from the head of Dupont saying, “You've got to come
                    back,” and I said, “Why do I have to come back?” “Well,” he says, “it's broken
                    up again.” I said, “It'll wait until I come back.” And when I came back it was
                    resolved.</p>
                <p>Shultz at that time developed the impression, that I had saved and pushed the
                    agreement. Now he's secretary of state. The only time we met was at that one New
                    York meeting. So he obviously had a plus attitude toward me. When he flew out to
                    Madrid on one of his European trips, I called the NATO caucus so that Shultz
                    could meet with the NATO caucus, and my friends in the NATO caucus, trying to
                    help me, I'm sure, told him what a good job I was doing and how happy they were
                    that the NATO caucus is together. So he felt very good and he and I developed a
                    very close, really good relationship.</p>
                <pb facs="0112" n="Page0112"/>
                <p>Whenever I came back to Washington - because we met at meetings for about six,
                    seven weeks and then break for a couple of weeks and then come back for six,
                    seven weeks and break again, and at every break I had to go see Shultz - and
                    Haig - when they were there, and I would brief them on what's happening. I said
                    to Shultz that I thought the Russians were going to give us everything we ask
                    for - this is now after about two years - and he said, “Why do you say that?”
                    and I said, “Well, because it's clear to me from my discussions with the
                    Soviets.” By then I was pretty close to the KGB general who was the number two
                    man and he spoke English. I think I mentioned that they had three different
                    heads of delegation, all of whom were deputy foreign ministers, but that the KGB
                    general was the consistent number two man who ran the delegation and was very
                    effective and skilled.</p>
                <p>I said, “Well, you know they've been terribly hurt by the Madrid meeting and they
                    know it. Their business of trying to stop the deployment of cruise missiles is
                    going down the drain; they can't stop it, and I think they just want to end the
                    meeting, as far as they were concerned, and I think they know that they've got
                    to give us what we want.” He said, “Well, that's great.” But I said, “I've got
                    to tell you I'm no longer satisfied with what we've asked for.” So he looked at
                    me and he said, “What do you mean?” I said, “Well, let's assume that we get
                    everything we ask for and I appear before a congressional committee and somebody
                    says to me, 'Well, what have you asked for?' and I said, 'Well, we asked for
                    this statement, that statement, the other statement, and the concluding
                    document.'" I continued, “If I were a member of Congress I'd say, 'Statements
                    again? What good do statements do? They don't live up to what they undertake
                    anyhow.'" Shultz was nodding his head, so I said, “I can not be satisfied unless
                    I get people out of there. If I can people out of jail, if I can get human
                    beings to be able to migrate out then at least I feel I've done something in the
                    three years, and not just getting some paper; and I can defend myself with the
                    Congress.” I had not planned to say this.</p>
                <p>He said, “You want to change the rules in the middle of the game?” I said, “I
                    guess I do.” Well, he said, “I can't authorize that. It's above my pay grade.”
                    Within a half hour we were at the White House. I had certainly not expected
                    this. Schultz said, “Max has got something to say.” By then I had a good
                    relationship with the President. Reagan turned to Shultz and said, “George, this
                    makes a lot of sense to me. How do you feel about this?” Shultz replied, “Mr.
                    President, it certainly does makes sense, but” he said, “you know our allies
                    won't like it. The Russians certainly won't like it. We're changing the rules.”
                    I then said, “Mr. President, that's right. They won't like it. The Germans won't
                    like it.” I said, “But I don't know that I have to tell them,” which is what I
                    added in my discussions. Reagan, just like this, says, “George, I like it. I
                    think this is what we ought to do,” and he said, “If Genscher calls, you handle
                    him; if the chancellor calls, I'll handle him.” Just like that. Then he said to
                    me, “How are you going to decide which people?” which of course is a good
                    question. I did not know. And he said, “What I'd like to do is include the
                    Pentecostals who are now in the embassy.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0113" n="Page0113"/>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: You may remember. I think there were seven or eight Pentecostals.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They had been there for a long, long time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: They had been there for a long, long time.</p>
                <p>And then Reagan said to me, “You know, when I first became President, I met with
                    Dobrynin. I talked to Dobrynin; I told Dobrynin if they want to have a good
                    relationship with me the first thing they ought to do is clear the decks and let
                    the Pentecostals out.” And he said, “I haven't heard a word about that since.
                    I'd like you to do what you can about the Pentecostals.” So I said, “Well, I
                    will.” And then I said, “I don't have any idea which people?I don't know. I'll
                    have to play it by ear.” I didn't have a number in mind; nor a plan. I just had
                    a principle in mind.</p>
                <p>Upon my return to Moscow and to Madrid, I got a hold of Kondrashev, the KGB
                    general, and I said, “Sergei, I have instructions from my President. I am not to
                    permit this meeting to end, or agree to anything, unless we can get people out.”
                    He blew up, because he was pushing to end the meeting. I said, “Look, I'm not
                    speaking just for myself, Sergei. I'm speaking for the President of the United
                    States and the Secretary of State. I have that authority and instructions from
                    them. I think what you should do is get in touch with your chief in Moscow and
                    you just better tell them what the story is.” This was Andropov at the KGB.
                    About a week later he came to me - less than a week - and said, “I've got
                    instructions to talk to you and to negotiate with you.”</p>
                <p>I left out one item. As Shultz and I are leaving the President's office at that
                    meeting, we're standing up and getting ready to go and the President said, “Wait
                    a minute, Max,” and he went to his desk and he opens up his desk and he picks
                    out a piece of paper - and he said, “See what you can do about these people.” So
                    I went outside - Shultz and I had not seen the piece of paper - we both look at
                    the paper, and there are the names of Jewish refuseniks who were in jail in
                    Russia. Now how long he had that piece of paper in his desk, I'll be damned if I
                    know. He may have had a meeting that morning and somebody may have given him a
                    list. I just haven't got the slightest idea. But I had a list, at least to begin
                    with, of people, and I of course used that list. I then had gotten a list from
                    Dante Fascell, who headed the commission...</p>
                <p>Oh, there was another condition. The Soviet condition from the negotiation was
                    that nobody must know about it except the President, the Secretary of State, and
                    me. So I said, “What about Dobrynin?” who was then the ambassador. He said,
                    “Above all, Dobrynin. He must not know. He sticks his nose into everything,” I
                    remember him saying that to me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was the president saying this?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0114" n="Page0114"/>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: No, this was the KGB man saying to me, “Nobody must know about this
                    except Shultz, Reagan and Kampelman.” I asked, “What about Dobrynin?” and he
                    said, “No, he sticks his nose into everything and we shouldn't be dealing with?”
                    He didn't want anybody else to know, and I couldn't tell allies. I've got that
                    list, people of all religions. We began negotiating. We agree on the
                    Pentecostals, but with one difference. I get a hold of Warren Zimmerman, who had
                    been my early deputy in Madrid and was now in Moscow as DCM (Deputy Chief of
                    Mission). I said to Warren - without telling him why - “Warren, you have the
                    names of the seven Pentecostals at the embassy. Can you get me the names of
                    every member of their family?” and he sent me more than eighty names from
                    Siberia, or wherever they were.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think they were from Siberia.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: Siberia, yes.</p>
                <p>So I didn't give Kondrashev seven names, I gave him eighty-some odd names from
                    these two Siberian families. At one point he says, “Okay, we're all set on that.
                    We'll let them go.” That's part of our deal. The reason I'm saying this is that
                    at one point he said to me, “We've got problems with the Siberians.” I said,
                    “What's the problem?” He said, “They have to go to Israel.” I said, “They're not
                    Jews.” He said, “They have to go to Israel.” I said, “They don't want to go to
                    Israel, they want to go to Germany.” I said, “They don't want to go to Israel.”
                    He said, “No, they must go to Israel.” I said to him, “Sergei, if they go to
                    Israel they'll land in Israel and take the next plane out to Germany.” He said,
                    “I don't care what they do after they land in Israel.” So, I made arrangements
                    with our American embassy to fly to Israel and then to Germany.</p>
                <p>I had a lady on the list who Dante Fascell had given me. Again, I can't quite
                    remember her name, but I think it was Katz. She had relatives in Florida. I
                    explained to Sergei, “Look, Fascell is the chairman of the congressional
                    commission,” which he was - the commission on the CSCE. I said, “He's very
                    important. He may even be at some point chairman of the foreign relations
                    committee.” So I said, “I think it will do your government some good to make a
                    friend here.” He came to me again later. “We can not let Katz go.” I said, “Why
                    can't you let Katz go?” Then he said Mrs. Katz shot Lenin. I said, “Sergei, the
                    Katz you're talking about shot at Lenin in 1923.” I knew the event, of course.
                    It was at an opera and a lady by the name of Katz, if that was her name, took a
                    shot at Lenin. She missed, but she took a shot at Lenin. But he said she shot
                    Lenin. I explained, “Katz is a common name.”</p>
                <p>We also had Natan Sharansky. I do want to say that with all names I mentioned, I
                    cleared those names with Sakharov, and I want to say why I cleared names.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now Sakharov was in Russia.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0115" n="Page0115"/>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: Sakharov was in Russia and I had been in touch with him for a long
                    time. From the beginning, before we had a deal - of people without Sakharov
                    saying okay. The names mentioned by me in the early days might put those people
                    at risk; and I didn't want to do that unless he could assure me that either they
                    or their families approved of my using their name. So Sakharov and I, through
                    the American embassy, were in touch with each other during those long Madrid
                    days. I had Sharansky's name on this list and Mrs. Sharansky, who was very
                    energetic had been to see me three or four times. So I had Sharansky on the
                    list. Kondrashev said yes, finally. We ended up with a few hundred people
                    getting out. On Sharansky, I said to Sergei: “You're telling me that Sharansky
                    can go doesn't help. How do we tell Sharansky? If you go tell him we have a
                    deal, he isn't going to believe any of you fellows. It's an empty promise.”
                    Well, he says, “What should we do?” So I said, “You have not let his mother see
                    him for more than a year,” which was true. Ida Milgram was her name. I said,
                    “You haven't let her see him for more than a year. You have to let her go to see
                    him and she will explain this to him.” So he agreed.</p>
                <p>I received a cable from the American embassy saying Ida Milgram came in to see
                    them, and said much to her surprise the KGB police were very pleasant with her
                    and asked her to come to the KGB office. She came to the KGB office and they
                    very politely gave her permission to go with her son. She wanted to know what
                    was happening, so they explained to her what was happening. In the meantime I
                    let his wife know what was happening. His wife came back to me and said that she
                    doesn't want him to leave. She didn't think he ought to ask to leave. She was
                    accompanied this time by some Hasidic Jews, with the long beards and the fancy
                    black hats. I said, “Why?” and she says, “Well, it's acknowledging the right of
                    the Soviet Union to have him there,” which I understood as a problem. As the
                    question came up, how does he get out, the Russians say to me, “He's got to
                    ask.” I said, “Well, he's got to be careful about the letter because if the
                    letter acknowledges anything or if it asks pardon, it really means 'I was
                    sentenced properly and I'm asking?'" So I came up with a one sentence letter
                    which the KGB agreed to. Anyhow, Ida Milgram went to visit her son and said to
                    her son that his wife did not think he should do this. Sakharov, however, was
                    urging him to accept this and to go to Israel; and he decided that he doesn't
                    want to write. He writes about this in his book. I saw him about a month ago at
                    Charlie Krauthammer's house. He's now a member of the Cabinet in Israel. Anyhow,
                    we ended up by getting a few hundred people out of jail and out of the Soviet
                    Union.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I wonder if you could go back now and talk about sort of
                        the nuts and bolts of this Madrid meeting. What you did talk about was sort
                        of the end game there, but at the beginning, what were we asking for and why
                        were the Soviets in such a bind?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0116" n="Page0116"/>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: The earlier meeting in Belgrade had been a fiasco. You were there in
                    Belgrade. You knew the problems, I gather. There were serious problems. There
                    was no effective NATO caucus. There were, in fact, divisions within the NATO
                    caucus. I think I mentioned here how we got the NATO caucus started again in
                    Madrid.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: So we had a caucus that was going and it was an effective caucus going
                    for the preparatory meeting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: With all of this the Soviets were on the run. NATO had decided to put
                    Pershings and cruise missiles into Europe to balance the Soviet weapons. This
                    was their great objective. You remember they produced hundreds of thousands of
                    people in demonstrations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was the hurrah of the?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: It was the last hurrah of the Soviet Union in Europe. And they were
                    losing that battle. Genscher and a number of Europeans felt that what we did in
                    Madrid helped them because of the publicity we were getting in Europe -
                    publicity which we were not getting in the United States, but that we were
                    getting in Europe. I was on radio practically every day talking about the Soviet
                    Union. So that was their position and they wanted to get rid of that problem and
                    move away. Their request was for a disarmament conference to take place in
                    Europe. They finally agreed that that disarmament conference should include the
                    Americans and the Canadians. Q: At first they had been trying to exclude the
                    Americans.</p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: At first they were trying to exclude us, in order to undermine NATO,
                    but then they saw that was not feasible so the United States was to come in.
                    During the course of the Madrid meeting as they saw they weren't getting any
                    place. Though they continued to call it a disarmament conference, what they were
                    really talking about was a conference on military confidence building measures.
                    NATO had a counter to that, which was a French proposal, for military confidence
                    building measures. That too was interesting because by the time I went to Madrid
                    in September of 1980, the United States had not agreed to the French proposal
                    and I was not authorized to sign on to the French proposal. But the French
                    proposal was on the table. There was a dispute in the administration between
                    Brzezinski and Vance. Vance wanted us to support the French proposal;
                    Brzezinski, and the Defense Department, did not want us to support the French
                    proposal.</p>
                <pb facs="0117" n="Page0117"/>
                <p>After the preparatory meeting, and the beginning of the main meeting, at a
                    meeting at the White House, I asked for permission to support the French
                    proposal at a time when I thought it would be helpful to us in the negotiation.
                    I did not wish to give a blanket endorsement, but in back of my head I was
                    always aware of the fact I could have a problem with the French, and I wanted to
                    have a bargaining tool. The recommendation I made was finally accepted by
                    Brzezinski and the Defense Department. It was a way to bring the administration
                    together, but it was also a way to give me a negotiating tool. I did feel,
                    during the course of the meeting - I thought it was a good proposal - and at an
                    appropriate time I signed on to that proposal for military confidence building
                    measures. Toward the very end of the meeting, the Turks raised some questions
                    about that. They, of course, are the next door neighbors and they were concerned
                    about it. What I did at that point is I asked for a meeting with the Joint
                    Chiefs and I flew back to Washington and I met with the Chiefs. I explained the
                    French proposal thoroughly to them and what I thought we were getting out of it.
                    I also had authority to send their representative on my delegation, who was an
                    air force colonel, to Turkey. So he went to Turkey and we ironed out that
                    problem with the Turks and the Turks were pleased about it. This was the
                    military component of Madrid.</p>
                <p>Jim Goodby, whose name may be familiar to you; you may know him?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, he's been in.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: Jim Goodby later headed up our delegation at that military meeting
                    dealing with confidence security building measures.</p>
                <p>The mechanics in Madrid were moving nicely; we were getting support from the
                    neutrals. Now, at the very end of the meeting the Maltese began to act
                    Malta-like.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this with Mintov still there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: He was still there as their leader, a strange man.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was a pain in the ass, from a NATO point of view.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0118" n="Page0118"/>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: A pain, and he was still there. His foreign minister, whose name
                    escapes me, became friendly with me. He would fly from Malta to Madrid. He had
                    met Walter Reuther, the UAW (Automobiles Union Workers) leader, and he looked
                    upon himself as a bosom pal of Walter Reuther. He had asked Walter about me and
                    Walter said he and I were friends, which we were. So he felt he was, therefore,
                    my bosom friend and that he could manipulate me. Toward the end, as expected,
                    Malta began making new demands. They would not end the meeting unless their
                    demands were met - which was their technique. We were finally all agreed now,
                    except for the Maltese. Saliba was their Madrid representative, is now their
                    ambassador in Paris, who wrote me a letter recently. I told Saliba, “You tell
                    your minister that I am leaving Madrid tomorrow on the plane and I'm going back
                    to my family and to my private life,” - you remember I was not a Foreign Service
                    officer - “and that I'm asking my delegation to leave with me, but we will have
                    a representative from the American embassy sitting in and instructed to say no
                    every time the Maltese delegation proposal comes up.” And I said, “When you're
                    ready to deal intelligently and responsibly I'll be glad to fly back for the
                    final meeting.” And I left. And I took the whole delegation with me. I had Terry
                    Todman, our country ambassador somebody to always be there to go through the
                    form. Larry Eagleburger, when I came back, said, “What are you doing here?” I
                    told him exactly what I was doing and he thought that was a great idea. Finally
                    the Maltese gave in and it ended the meeting.</p>
                <p>There was one other problem at the very end. For reasons of high principle, the
                    Russians kept one issue open that they would not agree to, and that was - we
                    agreed to many conferences; we agreed to have a conference on human rights once
                    a year instead of waiting three or four years, on democracy and human rights,
                    and I wanted to have a meeting on family unification to take place a year from
                    then, but they wouldn't have that. I wouldn't agree to the end of the meeting.
                    Neither would NATO, unless we got that one. I persuaded NATO to stick with us on
                    this. This went on for about ten days. I was stubborn.</p>
                <p>The Germans and the Spanish were great; all of NATO were great. I have to say we
                    were unified?I came up with an idea which I discussed privately with my Spanish
                    colleague, and that was for the Spanish prime minister - he was the Social
                    Democrat who became prime minister for a number of years; a capable man; I said,
                    “You're the host country. Why don't you have your prime minister call all
                    thirty-five delegations to a reception - call it a farewell reception - and let
                    him say that this impasse must end, and, therefore, he is proposing the final
                    compromise to end the meeting.” And I said, “The Soviets will have to accept
                    that. There's no way they can not accept it.” So we drafted a final item which
                    included what we wanted on family reunification. He called the meeting together;
                    he made a talk, distributed the paper to everybody, and then said, “I'm assuming
                    that everybody here is agreeing to this final proposal.” The Soviets looked at
                    me and they knew exactly what I had done. There was no doubt in that. And that's
                    how we ended the meeting.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0119" n="Page0119"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there the feeling that basically the whole Helsinki
                        thing, as far as the Soviets were concerned, was to get the borders set? And
                        the rest of it was considered kind of minor stuff, which all of a sudden
                        they found themselves stuck with. This was their tar-baby. They grabbed that
                        border issue and all of a sudden all these other things came at them.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: Exactly. You saw the award on my desk from Genscher, NATO was strong,
                    and of course my relationship with Shultz strengthened during this whole period,
                    and with Reagan, because Reagan was informed.</p>
                <p>As a matter of fact, I have another story about Reagan that I think is relevant
                    here. It was during Madrid. I think Chernenko was the new prime minister of
                    Russia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It didn't last very long.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: Yes, it didn't last very long. But it doesn't matter who was there. In
                    any event, my discussions with Sergei Kondrashev, the general, led me to have an
                    idea, not related to the Madrid meeting, as to what the United States might do
                    vis-�-vis the Soviet Union; and it had to do with the forthcoming meeting of the
                    United Nations General Assembly. So on one of my trips to Washington I took it
                    up with Larry Eagleburger. Larry listened and he said, “Max, I gave the opposite
                    advice to George yesterday.” Just like that. Well, I thought to myself, I made a
                    try. I wasn't pushing it, I was just discussing it. It wasn't part of my Madrid
                    meeting. So I figured okay, that was it. Then Larry went on to say, “But I think
                    George ought to hear what you have to say.” Within ten minutes we're in Shultz's
                    office. Larry asked me to explain, I explained. Shultz turns to Larry and he
                    says, “You gave me the opposite advice yesterday.” Larry says, “Yes, but I
                    thought you ought to hear Max.” Shultz says, “Well I then gave this advice to
                    the President yesterday.” So I figured I might as well drop the idea. Shultz
                    continued, “The President ought to hear what you have to say.” He called the
                    President's secretary, and said to me, “You have a nine o'clock appointment to
                    see the President tomorrow morning. And, Max, I can't be there,” Shultz said to
                    me, “because I've got a breakfast on the Hill and I've got to go to that
                    breakfast on the Hill.”</p>
                <pb facs="0120" n="Page0120"/>
                <p>So at nine o'clock the next morning I showed up at the White House, the secretary
                    said, “You can go in,” and I go in, obviously interrupting a staff meeting
                    because they're all there - Baker, Meese, the whole bunch of them, including the
                    vice president. They're all around the room. And the President said, “George
                    says I ought to hear something that Max has to say.” He explained to them and I
                    made my statement. I knew I was interrupting so I made it brief. When I made the
                    suggestion to Eagleburger, I never thought I would reach this moment. Baker
                    spoke up against it and said, “You know George gave us the opposite advice
                    yesterday. I think George was right.” Meese agreed with Baker. Two or three
                    others speak up; they all agree with Baker. I think, 'what am I doing here?'
                    First of all, it wasn't that important. The President must see something in my
                    face of disappointment, although I did not feel disappointed. The President
                    looked at me and said, “Max, don't pay any attention to any of these fellows.
                    Not a single one of them was ever a Democrat.” And that ended it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course he had been. He had been a real New
                        Deal-er.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: Everybody laughed, of course. Not a single one of them was ever a
                    democrat.</p>
                <p>I mention this because it's clear from what I've been saying that the President
                    that I knew in Madrid and in Geneva was not the President I read about in the
                    newspapers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You do get this feeling - people I've talked to - that
                        there was a president with very firm convictions and who focused on things.
                        Not everything; he went about sort of the routine of business.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: He had views.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He had strong views.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>You left the Madrid conference, I take it, with great pleasure.</p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: Oh sure. I want to say to you I was not getting a salary at all for
                    this. Three years without a salary, but I was getting income from my law firm. I
                    was getting my expenses paid, but I was theoretically just doing this for three
                    months.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0121" n="Page0121"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just to get an idea on sort of the Washington scene, which
                        I think many people don't understand; men and women are pulled in from time
                        to time, like yourself, from law firms or something to do something. I would
                        think their business would suffer. Is there a benefit by this? I mean the
                        fact that you've got a partner of a law firm who is out accomplishing
                        something other than helping AT&amp;T (American Telephone &amp; Telegraph
                        Company) make some more money.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: Well, first of all, I was lucky I could do that. The reason I could do
                    it is we had a successful law firm. I was still getting an income from the law
                    firm, and not only that, for example, during those three years we had about
                    three or four months when we weren't meeting at one point because of the Polish
                    problem - the Soviets in effect installed a general as Poland's dictator.</p>
                <p>We objected and the meeting adjourned for three or four months. I was back in my
                    law firm during that period of time. Our firm did not engage in any government
                    business, only private law.</p>
                <p>I talked about Romania, I talked about Hungary; now Poland. The number two person
                    in the Polish delegation was a man by the name of Jerry Novak?You know I made a
                    point of developing relationships with most of the delegations, including some
                    from eastern Europe. As a matter of fact, I am still in touch with some of them.
                    Did I tell you that a book by KGB General Kondrashev is in my library
                    autographed by him?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, I don't think so.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: Well, Sergei Kondrashev, a KGB general, wrote a book a few years ago
                    in which he wrote about his experiences before Madrid. He was in charge of the
                    KGB in Germany. The co-author of that book was the fellow who was in charge of
                    the CIA in Germany during the same time, and they both wrote a book together.
                    Sergei sent me a copy of the book, which is published by Yale University Press,
                    “To my friend, Max Kampelman, who taught me the importance of democracy and
                    human rights,” or something like it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, how wonderful.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0122" n="Page0122"/>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: Anyhow, Novak, the Polish fellow, came to me at one point ; he knew he
                    could trust me - and he had a serious problem. His wife has joined the Women's
                    Committee of Solidarity and his son has joined the Youth Committee of
                    Solidarity, obviously hostile to the government he was working for. So I said,
                    in effect, “Look, let them do what they feel like doing. You can't stop them;
                    they've already done it, but if you get in trouble, you come to me and I'll
                    arrange for you to go to the United States,” which was all I could do for him.
                    It so happened that after Madrid, I arranged for him to go to the United States.
                    He is now, I think, their ambassador to the democratic Poland and a senior
                    official in their Foreign Service. I wrote a letter in his behalf when
                    Solidarity took over control.</p>
                <p>The number three person at the Polish delegation was Adam Rotfeld, who also a
                    senior official in Poland. He told me an interesting story. He said that he was
                    born in a part of Poland that was near Russia and that his father was the mayor
                    of that small community. His parents were Jewish. When he was a baby the nuns in
                    that community went to his father and said, “Look, you're in trouble. We know
                    what's coming. We'd be glad to take your baby and bring him up.” So they took
                    the baby and during the war his parents were killed. At the end of the war the
                    nuns called him and explained to him that he was Jewish, that they took care of
                    him and his parents were now dead, and they gave him a choice. If he wanted to
                    continue in Poland, they would continue to support him through all of his
                    schooling. If he wanted to go to Israel, they had a branch in Israel and they
                    would send him to that branch and the nuns there would take care of him and he
                    would get his education in Israel. He knew nothing about Israel - he was a child
                    - and he elected to stay in Poland.</p>
                <p>He was a student of the number one man in the Polish delegation, who had been his
                    professor in courses. Novak had also been a student of the delegation. This
                    number one man, who was a professor, also brought these two former students to
                    work with him. Rotfeld was told that as a Jew, he could never have a career in
                    the Foreign Service. He had been number one in his class. We chatted about that
                    and he kept me informed about what was happening. I never asked either of them
                    to do anything that was unpatriotic or dangerous. But curiously, Rotfeld, is
                    today a very senior Foreign Service official. I received an e-mail from him last
                    week. I keep in close touch with these people because I've got a separate
                    proposal that I'm now working on involving CSCE (Conference on Security and
                    Cooperation in Europe) and OSCE (Organization on Security and Cooperation in
                    Europe).</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This brings up a question. You've got this international
                        convention of the Soviet bloc and the Western bloc getting together. Did you
                        have a problem with the CIA sniffing around or trying to develop agents and
                        all that? I mean this is what the CIA does.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0123" n="Page0123"/>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: I assumed that the CIA may have been there, but I had absolutely no
                    problems and no identification, as distinguished from my experience in Geneva.
                    You have to understand that the United States government, up until Madrid, had
                    pretty much dismissed the CSCE as an institution.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: To me it's a Cinderella story.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: They pretty much dismissed it. But had I known the CIA was there I
                    would not have been troubled. Nobody identified himself to me as being a CIA
                    agent.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because I was just wondering whether sometimes an over
                        eager CIA person can screw things up.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: I will say when we I got to Geneva the CIA was there, very
                    actively.</p>
                <p>So this is now '83. I'm back into private life and I find myself being called on
                    again, every once in a while. For example, Shultz called me one day and said:
                    “The President would like to see you.” The president wanted to discuss the
                    Soviet-Jewish question. The United States embassy was the only embassy
                    represents outside of the Jewish synagogue on Friday night in order to protect
                    the people from the KGB. He did not understand why our allies are not helping us
                    there. He wrote a letter to a few European heads of state asking for their
                    cooperation. He gave me the use of an airplane; asked me to hand deliver and
                    dismiss the letter. He wanted me to talk to them about having people at the
                    synagogue. I did. It was a great experience. It was great for me. I had not met
                    a lot of these heads of government. On another occasion Shultz wanted me to go
                    El Salvador. It was a mess. I went down and spent three days. Then I went for
                    the election of Duarte.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Duarte is in El Salvador.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: I went down and I saw Duarte first, then there was an election - the
                    first presidential election in El Salvador. Shultz asked me to serve as an
                    observer. Tom Pickering was our ambassador during that time. We flew to various
                    places on the day of the election. Tom Pickering and I were on the same
                    helicopter. The helicopter was behaving strangely, but nevertheless we landed
                    and we went to see the different places. There were very long lines for their
                    first election. The people were filled with tremendous enthusiasm. As we landed
                    back in the capitol, Tom motioned for me to come ahead and he showed me bullet
                    holes in the helicopter; he explained, “That's why we were behaving strangely.
                    They were shooting at us.” Tom and I are very good friends now and we see each
                    other socially.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0124" n="Page0124"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm interviewing Tom right now.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: For the inauguration of Duarte, Shultz was chairman of the delegation
                    and asked me to serve as a member of the delegation. On the plane I sat next to
                    Jesse Helms on the airplane. Helms and I were talking; he remembered me from the
                    days I was in the Senate and we talked about Humphrey, and again Helms said to
                    me how much he admired Humphrey. You know, I have found uniformly that this was
                    a man respected by Democrats and Republicans. Helms was telling me stories about
                    him and Humphrey and then somebody came up and asked me to go up front to talk
                    to Shultz.</p>
                <p>Shultz in effect said, “Max, we got some news that there will be an assassination
                    attempt at the swearing in, and I think you ought to know about it.” I said, “I
                    think Helms can help,'" because Helms, we knew, was close to the extreme
                    right-wing. “Well,” he says, “what do you think? Should I call him up?” and I
                    said yes. So I brought Helms up front and Shultz told him. Helms was troubled
                    and said, “George, can I have a car when we land?” and Shultz said, “We'll
                    arrange for you to have a car.” He said, “Give me a car and I'll do what I can
                    do.” There was no assassination attempt. Now, whether Helms talked to people
                    when he got there, I don't know. But it was interesting for me to have these
                    occasional breaks in between my diplomatic assignment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you feel about the whole El Salvador thing at the
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: Well I supported the democratic elements and I supported the
                    administration. You have to understand that my experience with the communists in
                    Minnesota, Europe, and elsewhere, led me to believe that they had tentacles out
                    all over the world. I have always had a consistent view that democracy and
                    extremism just are incompatible, right or left. So I had no problems with that.
                    As a matter of fact, when I was Counselor to the Department, I did quite a bit
                    of work in Central America, working with our friends.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This brings up a philosophical point. One of the things
                        that disturbs me - I was born in 1928 many people, somewhat on the left,
                        that you call liberals, sort of join wholeheartedly into believing that
                        communism is so great. You know, when you had the horrible example of Stalin
                        and everything else. Did you find yourself at odds with some of your
                        colleagues?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: Constantly, including my college days. I've been associated with
                    groups, resisting their influence within the liberal community because it's not
                    liberal. And the party is going through much of the same thing today again.
                    There is a kind of mentality which I don't understand; I'm not a psychologist.
                    It's a mentality which looks upon the right as an enemy. Well, some on the right
                    are fascists, but most are loyal believers in democracy.</p>
                <pb facs="0125" n="Page0125"/>
                <p>I think I told you the story of Humphrey and Joe Raugh where Humphrey said, “I
                    don't know about you, Joe, but I only have one President today,” - and his
                    president was Dwight Eisenhower - “and if he asks me to help, I'll help if it's
                    within my conscience.” Look, I personally know that my working with Reagan has
                    damaged me in the eyes of a number of liberals and Democrats. So be it. I also
                    know the Democratic President gave me the Medal of Freedom.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mean a Republican president?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: No, Clinton. He gave me the Presidential Medal of Freedom. You know,
                    it's puzzling and it's troublesome. It's a mixture of things, of what I don't
                    claim to know.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well you still see this battle fought out on the Internet
                        between, you might say, the Marxist point of view. I mean almost the last
                        stand of this. The philosophy, basically - you know, share the wealth and
                        all - is fine, but the practicality has been so horrendous.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: Well, I for one, strongly support the President's foreign policy.
                    Frankly, I oppose his domestic policy. I really do not understand, and can not
                    support, what he's doing [domestically]. And the White House staff know; and I
                    don't keep my views secret. I know a lot of people and I tell them what I think.
                    I just don't understand it. I look upon the theologians in both parties as those
                    I disassociate from, whether it's the theologian of the left of the theologian
                    of the right. The theologian of the right these days is a theologian who
                    believes somehow that the way to help the economy is to let it trickle down -
                    it's been a traditional view; help the people on the top and some water will
                    come to the bottom. I just don't accept that. And the theologians on the left
                    think that everybody who disagrees with them is dangerous. They are not
                    sufficient believers in democracy and liberty in my book.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think it's true of both sides with the theologians: do
                        it my way or?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: Anyhow, the period between my two diplomatic assignments is where we
                    are at. Now at one point I read in The New York Times that I was going to
                    replace Jeane Kirkpatrick as ambassador to the United Nations. I looked at the
                    newspaper and there's an item which nobody spoke to me about. People called me
                    on the telephone and I told them that I didn't know. I did know my friend Jeane
                    Kirkpatrick was leaving because she told me so. But I had no idea that there was
                    talk about me being her replacement. Jeane ended up agreeing to stay another
                    year.</p>
                <pb facs="0126" n="Page0126"/>
                <p>Soon thereafter I received a call from journalist Joe Kraft. He asked, “Max, when
                    are you going to the Middle East?” I replied that “I'm now in my law firm. I'm
                    not going to the Middle East, Joe.” Well, he says, “Max, I know it's not public,
                    but I know you're going to the Middle East.” So I said, “Joe, tell me what you
                    know.” He said that “You're going to be the Mideast negotiator.” “Oh,” I said, “
                    then you know something I don't know.” He said, “I got it from the Saudis and
                    I've now confirmed it with people at the State Department.” I finally persuaded
                    him to believe that nobody ever spoke to be about it, which was true. Nobody
                    ever officially talked to me about it, and as far as I knew, it was not true.
                    Maybe they forgot to call me or maybe they changed their minds.</p>
                <p>Then, at five o'clock one morning, I received a telephone call at home from a
                    lady - five o'clock in the morning - who identified herself as a lady from CBS
                    (Columbia Broadcasting System) radio. She said, “You know, Mr. Ambassador,
                    there's a conference now in Geneva between Shultz and Gromyko,” which I was
                    aware of because the newspapers had reported it. They were trying to put
                    together the arms negotiation again because the Russians walked out of the arms
                    talks. “Well,” she said, “we just got a cable from Dan Rather saying you're
                    going to the U.S. negotiator.” So I said, “I really don't think that's so. I
                    haven't heard anything about this.” I persuaded her that I had never heard
                    anything about this; I was not lying to her. And after a long conversation she
                    said, “Well, I have to tell you that we're running with it at six o'clock and I
                    have to tell you that you'll be getting phone calls, so you ought to be prepared
                    for it.” So I said, “Why are you running with it if you know that I haven't been
                    asked to do this?” She said, “Because Dan Rather says that you have the
                    assignment.” Just as simple as that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well obviously we know who has the power. You might
                        explain who Dan Rather is.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: So I turned off the phone. I left my home at about nine o'clock to go
                    to my law office and there were television reporters right in front of our house
                    here. I arrived at my law office to find television cameras in the office. All I
                    could say was that I didn't know anything about this, and that's all that I
                    said. “I know nothing about this” - because I didn't. Days went by, with the
                    press stories etc. I did not want the assignment. My wife did not want me to go.
                    She didn't want to live in Geneva. And I didn't want to go for two reasons: one,
                    I didn't want to go to Geneva; two, I didn't really feel qualified. It's a
                    complicated task. Although, I learned a lot from the Committee on Present
                    Danger, it was really complicated and I did not want to go to Geneva.
                    Furthermore, I did not believe I was going because nobody had asked me to go. I
                    figured it was The New York Times story and Joe Kraft all over again. So my wife
                    said, “Max, you've got to do something about this,” because we were being
                    pestered. She suggested that I call Shultz. I responded “Well, I've thought of
                    calling Shultz but I'm a little concerned about calling,” because, you know, the
                    Dutchman was likely to say to me, “Who the hell asked you?”</p>
                <pb facs="0127" n="Page0127"/>
                <p>I called Larry Eagleburger who had just left the State Department and was working
                    with Kissinger. Once on the phone with Larry, I could not get a word in
                    edgewise. Typically, he was calling me stupid and dumb etc.., as Larry
                    Eagleburger has the capacity of doing. And I said, “Larry, why?” and he in
                    effect said, “You have no business taking this goddamn job. You can't win on
                    this job. It's an impossible job, It's a lost job. You don't know enough. You
                    have no business doing this.” And I said, “Larry, that's why I'm calling you. I
                    want you to tell George Shultz?” - and I explained to him that nobody had asked
                    me to take the job. I asked Larry to “Tell George, please, that I don't want the
                    job, I really don't want the job. I strongly don't want the job.” So he asked
                    me, “What if he says, 'Will Max take the UN job?'". So I said, “What UN job,
                    Larry?” Well, he says, “The one I talked to you about.” I said, “Larry, you
                    never talked to me about the UN job.” So there was some truth in the UN report,
                    but he never did talk to me about; he thought he had talked to me about it.
                    “Well,” he said, “ I meant to talk to you about it but then Jeane decided to
                    stay another year.” So I said, “If he offers me the UN job, that I will take,
                    because I would like to serve the country. I don't mind working at that job, but
                    if Jeane leaves, sure, it's New York. I wouldn't say no to that job, but I don't
                    want the Geneva job.” He called me back an hour or two later and said, “Mission
                    Accomplished.”</p>
                <p>I was scheduled to speak in Sun Valley, Idaho, at a Young Presidents
                    Organization. My wife and I thought we'd follow it with a few days of vacation
                    at the same time. I was about to be introduced and a lady ran up to the dais,
                    “There's a call for you from the White House.” So obviously I stopped. It was
                    Shultz and Cap Weinberger both on the phone. “Max, you'll be getting a phone
                    call in five minutes from the President and we don't want you to say no.” Shultz
                    and Weinberger knew I did not want the job. And I said, “You know, I can't take
                    this job. I really can't take this job. I'm not qualified.” They said in effect,
                    “We'll get you a top-notch deputy.” The President called me in five minutes. He
                    knew that I was reluctant - he had been told - and he said, “You're going to go
                    to Geneva, Max” and, “I'm asking you to go.” And, “Where are you?” I told him
                    where I was and he said, “Can you be in Washington tomorrow?” I said, “Yes. I'll
                    leave tonight.” Meanwhile, the audience was nervous and excited about the fact
                    because they were told about the call. So my wife and I left and I went to see
                    the President in Washington. He made it clear to me that he couldn't find
                    anybody else who satisfies both Weinberger and Shultz.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q. Oh yes. These two are at loggerheads, although they were
                        friends.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: That's right. They were at loggerheads here. President Reagan said
                    both of them were prepared to accept me. He said I would always have access to
                    him. When I was in town and there's a meeting of the National Security Council,
                    he wanted me to be at,” which was kind of a nice thing - and he lived up to
                    that. And with that said, I found myself going to Geneva.</p>
                <pb facs="0128" n="Page0128"/>
                <p>I learned in the process that I had three negotiations occurring simultaneously
                    and I was the head of all three, but my specific job was on ballistic missile
                    defense (SDI). John Tower was to head start; Mike Glitman was experienced with
                    the INF. John Tower spent twenty years in the Senate and was chairman of the
                    Armed Services Committee. When Shultz told me this, I said, “George, John Tower,
                    twenty years in the Senate; how is he going to feel about me being the overall
                    chairman?” Shultz told me “He's going to have to accept it.” I said, “He knows
                    more about this subject than I do.” He said that I would be supported as
                    chairman” I thought to myself that Mike Glitman had a career in the Foreign
                    Service and worked with Paul Nitze. I asked, “Why isn't Paul Nitze doing this?”
                    I was told he was too old; and would serve in Washington working with Shultz and
                    the President. I said, “What about Ed Rowny?” The die was cast.</p>
                <p>I will say that the President gave us a grand sendoff; he arranged a breakfast of
                    Congressional leaders for the day that we were leaving. Cap Weinberger gave us
                    an airplane. Since I don't like to fly all night, I persuaded the Defense
                    Department that we leave at noontime so we can consult. When I was traveling to
                    Europe as a lawyer I always took a morning flight out of Kennedy, because I
                    didn't want to fly all night. The a breakfast at the White House was with the
                    leaders of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, the Senate Armed Services
                    Committee, the House Foreign Relations, and the House Armed Services. It was a
                    good-bye, farewell meeting and they gave us a great sendoff. Reagan was
                    wonderful in what he said; they were all cooperative.</p>
                <p>But before that, the was another interesting incident. I was able to attend the
                    National Security meetings. For one of the first meetings that took place I
                    received an invitation from the White House: 'The President wants you at the
                    meeting.' So I went to the meeting. Geneva hadn't started yet. Cap Weinberger
                    said, “Mr. President, I have learned of some disturbing news. I have learned
                    that Bob Byrd,” Senator from West Virginia and the leader of the Senate at the
                    time, “is introducing a resolution, putting the Senate right into our
                    negotiations in Geneva by getting a special committee involved to do this. This
                    is interfering with your constitutional responsibilities and we've got to stop
                    it. You've got to do something about this.” The President - and I found this was
                    a pattern for him; went around the table; he did no respond; he just went around
                    the table having other people comment on what was said. Everybody agreed this is
                    a terrible idea, that it's an interference. He then said, “Well, Max, what do
                    you think?” I said, “Mr. President, I hadn't heard about it before.” But I
                    continued, “When I was in Madrid, you remember, I found the Congress to be very
                    helpful to me,” which they were. I had worked very closely with the Congress. So
                    he says, “Max, why don't you go see Bob Byrd and tell him that I asked you to
                    see him?”</p>
                <pb facs="0129" n="Page0129"/>
                <p>So I went to see Bob Byrd. When I met with Bob Byrd, he told me that he was
                    putting together a committee - Democrats and Republicans - across the
                    appropriate top committees and he wanted his committee to be right on top of the
                    negotiations. So we talked and I told him about my Madrid experiences with
                    Congress. We negotiated a deal. It was going to be an observer committee. I
                    said, “We can't have any of you sitting in on the negotiations. You just can't
                    do that. I want you out there frequently and I will make arrangements for you to
                    meet the Soviet delegates every time any of the congressional people come out.
                    If you were a Russian and you knew that there were some Senators there sitting,
                    you'd be talking to the senators, not to the U.S. negotiators. You will
                    downgrade the status of the U.S. negotiators, so I can't permit you to do that.
                    I will brief you fully. There will be no secrets from you.” So we negotiated
                    that deal and then I also said to him, “I want you there on the opening day. I
                    want to show we're there with the consent and approval of the American
                    government, President and Congress.” He agreed; he understood everything - and
                    we worked out a good deal. And then as we finished he said, “You know, Max, I'm
                    a little puzzled,” because I told him about Cap Weinberger. He said, “I'm a
                    little puzzled about this. I didn't make this proposal without first calling the
                    President and talking to him about it. The President thought it was a damn good
                    idea.” Isn't that interesting?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: The President never let on at that meeting that he even knew about it.
                    So we worked out a deal where they came out frequently. There were two or three
                    people in the House who would come out as well and I would always brief them
                    fully, but the Senators came out regularly, steadily. Al Gore was constantly
                    coming out. Ted Stevens, Al Gore, and Claiborne Pell were frequently together
                    and they were helpful to us. I'd arrange press conferences, with photographs, so
                    that they could send pictures back to their constituents about their involvement
                    in Geneva. They knew everything that was happening because I told them. We
                    discussed matters. And when I came back to Washington the observer committee
                    always had a meeting that I attended where I would brief them. I'd bring Mike
                    Glitman and John Tower around for the meetings. John, of course, would love it
                    when the Senators would come out because they were his old colleagues.</p>
                <pb facs="0130" n="Page0130"/>
                <p>Now, interestingly enough, this is not of national importance but one such event
                    comes to mind now. Claiborne Pell, who was Chairman of the Foreign Relations
                    Committee, was on this observer group and one day he called me on the phone and
                    said, “Max, I can't help it; I'm going to be absent on one of our visiting
                    days.” I said, “Claiborne, what's up?” and he said, “Well, I'm going to go to
                    Zurich. A friend of mine is going to be there.” I said, “Why don't you have him
                    come meet you in Geneva so you don't have to leave?” It turns out the friend
                    happened to be Yuri Geller, who was on the stage as a magician or as a mind
                    reader and did what are considered tricks through his mind - paranormal.
                    Claiborne Pell was a believer in the paranormal. He arranged for Geller to come
                    to Geneva instead of Zurich. I then said, “Why don't you go back to him and say
                    that since we're going to have a reception for the Senators with the Russians -
                    let him take the stage.” Claiborne thought that was a great idea so he called
                    Yuri Geller and Geller said he'd be delighted to do that.</p>
                <p>So we had a large reception with the Russians and the Americans; all the
                    delegates from both groups - and Geller took the platform. In the meantime he
                    called my secretary and asked her to bring a tea spoon to the meeting. Well,
                    what does he do with the tea spoon? He took that tea spoon, which my secretary
                    brought, so it couldn't have been his, and with his mind he bends the goddamn
                    thing. And I saw him do it. I was on the platform. He bent it. He proceeded by
                    taking my watch. He moved it backwards without touching it, by two minutes.
                    Everybody was saying it was really a fantastic kind of performance. Of course,
                    afterwards the Russian head of delegation said to me, “You know, we have people
                    like that in Russia, too.” Anyhow, the rapport between us and the Senators was
                    good and we had a pretty good personal rapport with the Soviets as well.</p>
                <p>Now on this connection, before I forget I want to put one other incident in.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0131" n="Page0131"/>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: I got to know, of course, General Abramson, who was the head of U.S.
                    missile defense. As part of my job I was briefed by him. Part of his people were
                    on my delegation since my delegation consisted of people from Defense, the Joint
                    Chiefs, State, CIA - you know, the whole works. We had a large delegation! At
                    one point I saw Abramson in Washington and said, “Abe, when you're next in
                    Europe, why don't you come to Geneva and I'll introduce you to the Russian
                    generals who are there. As a matter of fact, I'll invite them to a session with
                    you, if you'd like.” I thought that would be a good idea. So he replied, “I'd
                    like to do that.” He informed me that he was going to be in Europe at [this and
                    this time].” There were three chief Russian negotiators, just as there were
                    three Americans. I told my Russian counterpart in the space and defense area, my
                    counterpart, Kvitzinsky, that I've invited General Abramson to Geneva. I didn't
                    know if he'll come, but I hoped when Abramson came that he and his group would
                    be willing to meet with Abramson. I remember Kvitzinsky said to me very
                    formally, “If the American delegation asks the Soviet delegation to attend a
                    meeting, the Soviet delegation will always comply.” Just very formal. I figured
                    the Russians didn't want to go on record with anything, which was fine. Then Abe
                    called me and said, “I'll be with you at [this and this date].” So I told my
                    Russian counterpart, “General Abramson will be here on [this and this date]. I'd
                    like to invite your Space and Defense delegation to a meeting to meet him and
                    have him talk with you.” And he said, “When the American delegation invites the
                    Soviet delegation, then we will attend.”</p>
                <p>I then received a call from Abramson saying he couldn't attend the meeting. I
                    said, “Why can't you come?” He replied, “Cap doesn't want me to go.” I said, “I
                    want you to come. You've got to come.” Well, he said, “Cap Weinberger has
                    rejected the trip.” I called the White House and said, “You shouldn't be
                    interfering with the negotiations this way.” I don't know who made things work
                    out, but Abramson came out and the meeting was fascinating. Abe was a thin,
                    tall, and athletic man. It seemed to me, as I looked at the delegation of Soviet
                    generals, not a one of them was under two hundred pounds. Abramson told the
                    Russians not only about the U.S. program, but he told them about the Russian
                    program too, and it was clear to me that he knew more about the Russian program
                    than they did. And they were furiously taking copious notes. Really. Furiously
                    taking notes. This proved very helpful to us in the talks.</p>
                <pb facs="0132" n="Page0132"/>
                <p>Interestingly enough, regarding my relationships with the Soviets in Geneva
                    Kvitzinsky was a very capable diplomat who earlier walked in the woods with Paul
                    Nitze. At one point, he spoke English fluently. I was having lunch with Yuri; I
                    found luncheons were far better forums because there are no interpreters present
                    and with no interpreters they spoke freely; it's not reported; I remember saying
                    to him, “Yuri, what the hell are you still doing in Geneva? You were with Paul
                    Nitze. You are better than that. You know your decisions are being made in
                    Moscow. Get out of this. This is not going to help your career.” And I said it
                    genuinely because by then I knew his wife was a teacher and I knew his family
                    situation. He said, “What should I do?” I said, “You know people. Get yourself
                    the ambassadorial post to Germany. You speak German fluently. That's what you
                    should do. Because here you're nothing. You're just reporting back and you're
                    doing the same thing you did years ago. It's not challenging your mind.” And he
                    knew I was right. Curiously enough, a few months later I received a note from
                    him: 'Dear Max, I took your advice.' - nothing else - he was appointed the
                    ambassador to Germany. Isn't that interesting?</p>
                <p>Now Victor Karpov, who was with me the overall head of the delegation and
                    specifically negotiated START was a real professional diplomat, but
                    unfortunately he was an alcoholic...As a matter of fact, at one point the Swiss
                    police came to me, (I had good relationships with the Swiss) and said they found
                    him in the gutter, and what should they do? I said, “Take him back to the
                    mission. Don't say a goddamn thing to anybody, and keep it away from the press,”
                    which they did. Karpov knew that. Early on the negotiators under John Tower (I
                    had two roles - I was the chairman of the whole thing, but I was also
                    responsible for Space and Defense) very proudly told me they had Victor Karpov
                    over for cocktails the previous evening, they got him drunk and they had an
                    inside track now. I got a hold of John Tower and I said; “John, that'll never
                    happen again. That's not the way the United States is negotiating. You are not
                    to get him drunk again. And if I hear that you're going to get him drunk again,
                    I'm simply going to report it to the White House, and I don't want to have to do
                    that.” To the best of my knowledge that was not done again. But I got a hold of
                    Karpov and I said, “Victor, this is what I learned. Stop that. Don't do that.
                    Drink in your apartment if you must. The KBG will get you.” Victor Karpov has
                    passed on since then so I feel I can talk about him more openly. But you can see
                    that for me this was all an interesting kind of never before experience, so I
                    could make my own rules of operation.</p>
                <p>Do you want to continue? I have a few other things to say, but that's up to
                    you.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's continue.</hi>

                <pb facs="0133" n="Page0133"/>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: At one point now I received a call from the White House at one point
                    saying, “Max, we'd like you to go to India. The president met with Indira
                    Gandhi,” who was then the president of India. Gandhi was very pro-Soviet and the
                    President said to Gandhi that he was going to send you out there to talk about
                    the American position. They of course would provide me an airplane. I was busy;
                    I was deeply involved in the Geneva negotiations, but I went. I remember flying
                    out on Friday morning to India and meeting with Gandhi and then meeting with the
                    foreign and defense ministers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Her. Oh, it was Rajiv Gandhi at that time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: The defense minister impressed me. And I remember saying to the
                    defense minister, “You know, you've got a lot of superb scientists in your
                    country.” A lot of them had been trained in the United States. “You've got a
                    problem of Chinese nuclear capacity. You ought to be putting up your own
                    defenses. You ought to be talking to our Defense Department about how you can
                    have missile defenses, instead of attacking our missile defense program.” Sunday
                    I was back in Geneva. It was a quick trip.</p>
                <p>Anyhow, another call came from the White House. “The President wants you to go to
                    Australia.” Well you just don't make a weekend trip to Australia. So I said,
                    “Well, can I do that during the summer break?” and they said, “Yes.” The
                    President had met with the Australian prime minister, Hawke, who was also
                    apparently partial toward the Soviet position, and he wanted me to deal with
                    that. My wife and I decided to turn it into a vacation. State worked out the
                    arrangements to go to Australia. We had a date certain and Maggie and I decided
                    we would stop first in New Zealand, then go on to Australia, and we'd take our
                    youngest daughter with us and make a family trip. I was saying goodbye to Shultz
                    the previous day - I was supposed to leave the next morning - and he wanted to
                    know a little bit more of what my plans were and I said, “Well, we're first
                    stopping for a few days in New Zealand,” and he said, “You're not going to New
                    Zealand?” and I said, “Yes.” He said, “You can't go to New Zealand.” I said,
                    “Why can't I go to New Zealand?” and he replied, “We're not sending any
                    diplomats to New Zealand.” You may remember we had a struggle with New Zealand
                    over nuclear ships.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: He said, “Look, why don't you let Maggie go to New Zealand with your
                    daughter and you go to Australia, and then let her join you in Australia?” So I
                    obviously didn't go to New Zealand. I went to Australia. Hawke was the prime
                    minister at the time. He is somebody who became my friend later on. I spent time
                    and we vacationed in Australia; it was a good session.</p>
                <pb facs="0134" n="Page0134"/>
                <p>Then on the way back Shultz suggested that since it was summer he would be in
                    Palo Alto at his home and he said, “When you come back, why don't you stop by
                    Palo Alto and we'll visit?” Our ambassador was a man by the name of Lane, who
                    was a good friend of Shultz's. The ambassador was very helpful to me and we had
                    a good time in Australia. My talks with Hawke went well. I then flew to San
                    Francisco and then Palo Alto while Maggie saw some friends of hers. We were
                    sitting around the swimming pool in Palo Alto and Shultz said, “I need somebody
                    in Washington. My counselor is leaving.” - he was the fellow who later became
                    postmaster general - and he said, “I've got to find a replacement.” I said,
                    “What are you looking for?” I was thinking he wanted suggestions. Schultz wanted
                    somebody that could be in Washington if he and the deputy secretary were out of
                    Washington. He wanted somebody who could take some of his speaking engagements
                    outside of the country or in country. He wanted somebody who can help him with
                    the relationships with Congress. And I came up with a few names of good people.
                    And then he said that he knew he really wanted me there. So I said, “Well, Mr.
                    Secretary, I'll be pleased to come if you want me to come there, but then we
                    have the job of finding somebody to take my place.” So, we discussed about who
                    could take my place.</p>
                <p>He didn't want me to talk about this to anybody. So I did not. We came up with
                    Paul Wolfowitz, who was our ambassador to Indonesia, and he said to me, “I don't
                    think Paul will take it. Paul is great, but I don't think Paul will take it
                    because he wife loves it out there and he loves it out there. Will you call
                    him?” When we got back to Washington I called Paul on the phone and Paul said he
                    wanted to think about it. He called back the next day and said no, that they
                    wanted to stay in Indonesia. Shultz then called me and said he had talked to the
                    President and the President did not want me to leave Geneva. So I figured, well,
                    okay, that's it. “So the President suggested, why don't you do both jobs.” So I
                    said, “Do you think it's feasible for me to do both?” and he noted we completed
                    one treaty. The other one was well on its way. I could fly back and forth; I was
                    not any longer needed to be there every day. I ended up with both jobs, but I
                    stayed more in Washington. In any event, as a result of this I saw a lot of the
                    Russian foreign minister, Shevardnadze.</p>
                <p>Shultz came to me one day in Washington and said, “I just heard from
                    Shevardnadze. He's going to be in Geneva on [this and this day] and he wants to
                    know whether you will be there.” So I said, “If he's going to be there, I'll be
                    there, if he wants to see me.” So I made arrangements to be there. I set up a
                    meeting for nine o'clock that morning at the Russian mission. I flew in the
                    previous day to Geneva and my press man told me that “The meeting will be over
                    at ten o'clock.” I said, “How do you know it will be over at ten o'clock?” Well,
                    he told me, they called a press conference for 10:15. The meeting lasted until
                    about 12:30, incidentally, and I did not invite Tower or Glitman to join me, for
                    two reasons - one, they were not invited; two, Shultz wanted me to be there
                    alone, without the other two. I found that what he really wanted to do is to
                    find out why the U.S. was taking the positions we took and he didn't trust the
                    word he was getting from his negotiators. Based at least on our meetings
                    together, he felt I'd be frank with him. This was after the Reykjavik, Iceland
                    summit.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0135" n="Page0135"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, the Reykjavik meeting between Gorbachev and
                        Reagan.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: I had a chance to spend a little time with Shevardnadze. Anyhow, the
                    meeting lasted until 12:30 and we went through the whole protocol. I was very
                    straight with him. For example, on one item I remember, which involved a
                    military matter. I said to him, “Look, I don't understand this position by the
                    U.S. I don't know why we have this position,” but I said, “This position is
                    strongly held by the navy.” And I said that I could not believe that the
                    President would act against the navy on this question, and it does not in any
                    way adversely affect Russia. In spite of what your people may tell you, I said,
                    I don't see how you're hurt by this. “Furthermore,” I continued, “our navy has
                    responsibilities your navy does not have. We have a navy all over the world.
                    Your navy is not all over the world.” He understood. It was a candid exchange. I
                    said, “I can ask for an explanation if you want it. I may not understand it
                    because I'm not an expert in this field.”</p>
                <p>Kvitzinsky went to Germany to be their ambassador. Shevardnadze replaced Karpov
                    as the head of the delegation. He kept Karpov as the START negotiator, and since
                    I was Counselor, he replaced Karkov as head with a man who later became their
                    ambassador here in Washington, one of their senior diplomats, who spoke English
                    fluently. We ended up, as you know, with two treaties.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'd like to stop at this point. I want to ask some
                        questions about while you were dealing with this about changes in the Soviet
                        Union, because the arrival of Gorbachev and Shevardnadze. And then of course
                        there was the meeting between Gorbachev and Reagan, and then the Reykjavik
                        meeting in Iceland where almost all reference was?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: I do have something to say about the Geneva meeting, but I can say it
                    next time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Max, while you were doing the Madrid talks and all of
                        this, were changes in the Soviet Union having a major effect?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: The Madrid talks did not come at about the time of changes in the
                    Soviet Union. The change was during the Geneva talks.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You went back to private life and you were
                        involved...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: I went back to private life after Madrid and I kept getting called on
                    periodically to do occasional chores, which I was delighted to do.</p>
                <pb facs="0136" n="Page0136"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As we moved in toward the end of the Reagan Administration
                        things were really beginning to pop in the Soviet Union. Did you get
                        involved in this at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: Oh sure. I have no doubt in my mind that Reagan and Shultz had a great
                    deal to do with the changes. We, of course, had nothing to do with the fact that
                    Gorbachev was selected to head up the Soviet Union, but I will say that the
                    inter-relationship between both Gorbachev with both Reagan and Shultz, as well
                    as the inter-relationship of Shevardnadze with Shultz, played, I think, a
                    significant role in the transformation of the Soviet Union. I also believed,
                    with others, that the Madrid meeting had a great impact on the leadership of the
                    Soviet Union. Whether it had any impact on the selection of Gorbachev I haven't
                    the slightest idea, but I do know that they took a licking and knew it; and from
                    what we later learned, it was a setback, because we talked to many of the
                    Soviets afterwards.</p>
                <p>As far as the inter-relationship between Gorbachev and Reagan is concerned, that
                    began really with the first summit in Geneva between the two of them. I did not
                    attend that summit. We called a break in our Geneva negotiations during the
                    period. I asked Shultz whether he expected me to be there because if he did I
                    would've gone there, but he said no, he wanted me to be in Washington and that
                    if he needs to call me he could. He did not think that the negotiations would
                    deal with arms control because the arms control negotiations had just recently
                    begun. Interestingly, if I could drop a footnote here, John Tower, who was
                    living in Geneva decided, with his wife, to actually live in Geneva during the
                    talks. So he was in Geneva. I had my family here in Washington. John wanted to
                    go to the summit talks; he wanted to be in on the talks. I told him that I did
                    not think that he would be welcome at the talks, but that I had no problem if he
                    could arrange it. He tried to arrange it and he was turned back.</p>
                <p>At the end of those talks - it was close to Christmas and we had a Christmas
                    break in Geneva - I came back to Geneva in early January. Two things happened.
                    One, before I went back there was a meeting of the National Security Council,
                    and as you remember I said that I was invited to the meetings of the National
                    Security Council. Reagan made the case and felt very positive about his meeting
                    with Gorbachev. He said, “I think Maggie was right. I think we might be able to
                    deal with him,” which was interesting. We didn't go into a great deal about that
                    at the National Security Council meeting, but he discussed a little bit his
                    feelings about the meeting. When I got back to Geneva Victor Karpov took me
                    aside. “Max, I just want you to know that I have instructions from my highest
                    authority not to attack your President.” He didn't say who it was; I assumed it
                    was Gorbachev.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had the President been attacked before?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0137" n="Page0137"/>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: Well the Russians were always attacking the President. Whoever the
                    President was, the Soviets were attacking the President. But he said, and then I
                    had to laugh as we broke up to go into the formal meeting, he said, “That
                    doesn't cover your Secretary of Defense,” which I laughed at. I'll jump now a
                    few years, if I may.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had you, though, sensed on our side somewhat the same
                        thing or had we been pretty careful in our language?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: We've always been careful with the language. I think we were most
                    careful with our language.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you picking up any instructions or something, “Let's
                        proceed a little differently”?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: There was absolutely no change in our approach. Nobody ever said to me
                    that we should make a change, nor did we in any way alter our position with
                    respect to SDI. But what I did hear, personally, is the President saying I think
                    we can do business with this fellow.</p>
                <p>The reason I'm jumping now is that after the Reagan presidency I received a call
                    or a letter, maybe both, from Mrs. Reagan saying that the Reagan Foundation was
                    going to have a commemoration meeting about Reykjavik, and she asked if would I
                    attend and speak at the meeting. This was after I was out of government, and I
                    said of course I'd be delighted to do that. They had the interpreter for
                    Gorbachev there. Gorbachev was not there but the interpreter of Gorbachev was
                    there who was at all of the sessions. The Geneva meeting came up. The man who
                    was our chief of staff of Reagan who recently died - the Wall Street broker
                    whose name escapes me, was also there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Regan.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: Regan, that's right. He was also there.</p>
                <p>We had a very interesting day chatting about the talks. On the Geneva meeting,
                    the interpreter impressed me with the fact?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was sort of a bald man with a big mustache.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: He was the Russian.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0138" n="Page0138"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, the Russian. You'd see him all the pictures.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: Yes, you'd see him in all the various places and he knew his
                    stuff.</p>
                <p>He said that they had been briefed before the meeting about Reagan and what they
                    expected to find was a doddering old man with pretensions, a cowboy, an old
                    movie actor, and not a serious person. They drove up - it's freezing cold, he
                    said, and Gorbachev was bundled in one of these Russian fur coats and hats; I
                    know Geneva can be cold. He said, “We drove up to this place, opened the door,
                    and there is this fellow. Ronald Reagan without a coat, a big smile, rushing out
                    of the door to greet us.” And he said, “It shocked all of us.” Regan interrupted
                    and said, “I just want you to know we had a heavy fur coat on Reagan's
                    shoulders, expecting him to go out in his fur coat, and as your car driver drove
                    up the president said, 'Who the hell needs this?' and threw the coat away and
                    came out,” which was an interesting little sidebar, and I thought it relevant
                    for this phase.</p>
                <p>In any event, shortly after the Geneva meeting got under way, the interpreter
                    said, “We were further surprised by Reagan saying to Gorbachev, 'Let's just go
                    walk and talk,'" and he pulled Gorbachev into a small lake house closer to them.
                    I remember it; I've seen it. It was a glorified hut. And, from what the
                    interpreter said, and from what I later saw in the notes that the interpreter
                    had made of the meeting, Reagan was quite open about the fact of what are we
                    going to do about this relationship between our two countries. The issue of
                    whether or not we were going to war? Are we going to go to peace? What are we
                    going to do? How are we going to handle this? It's up to us to make the
                    decisions. Do we need nuclear weapons? They found it to be a very constructive
                    meeting and a constructive opening, though they never did get to arms control or
                    any other detail.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm trying to get a little bit of how you worked this; you
                        were both the Counselor of the State Department and our negotiator
                        chairman?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: At that time I was not yet Counselor to the State Department. Our
                    Geneva negotiations had just started. I didn't become Counselor to the State
                    Department until we had practically finished the INF (Intermediate Nuclear
                    Forces) Treaty - practically finished it - and had most of the START treaty
                    understood between us, with details to be worked out. It was at that time, even
                    though the negotiations continued for another year-and-a-half, I was full-time
                    negotiator, not Counselor. But when Shultz and the President asked me to take on
                    the additional job, the heavy work was really done in Geneva. We needed
                    technicians to come together, which took a lot of time, but the really serious
                    policy questions were coming to a close.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At the Geneva thing while sort of the heavy work was done,
                        how did these talks start? Was it saying we really have to do something
                        here? Do you think on both sides or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0139" n="Page0139"/>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: The talks started with formal statements that were really formal
                    presentations by each side. The Soviets attacked us for wanting to undermine the
                    ABM (Anti-Ballistic Missile) Treaty with our missile defense program. I spoke
                    for the United States and my point was that what we were doing was not in
                    violation of the ABM Treaty, but that what we really needed to do was begin to
                    modernize our systems. We knew they had their defenses and we were going to
                    proceed with our defenses. It was very formal and the formal presentations
                    continued practically until the very end. The informal discussions didn't begin
                    until Gorbachev moved in and Shevardnadze moved in and then the coldness began
                    to break down.</p>
                <p>I will, in that connection, say that the first meeting between Shevardnadze and
                    Shultz took place in Finland at a conference that I also attended. The two of
                    them had some private time together. We had a meeting between the two
                    delegations. This was not arms negotiations, but the delegations at the Helsinki
                    meeting, and then Shultz took Shevardnadze aside and the two of them were
                    together about thirty or forty minutes. This was after the Geneva summit. Shultz
                    felt very comfortable about Shevardnadze and the relationship between the two
                    became extremely close; family close. Shultz learned about Shevardnadze's
                    grandchild who was ill. Shultz made great efforts to find where in the United
                    States the medical facilities were appropriate to what he understood the illness
                    of the grandchild to be, and he made efforts in that direction. The relationship
                    was a good relationship between them, to the point where after I became
                    counselor - Shultz came into my office, which was next to his because I had the
                    counselor's office, and he said Shevardnadze was going to be in Geneva. Did I
                    mention this?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I can't recall.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: Shevardnadze was going to be in Geneva on this and this date and he
                    wanted to know whether I would be there and I said to Shultz, “If Shevardnadze
                    will be there, I'll be there,” because I was flexible. I was going back and
                    forth, dividing my time. There were still some outstanding issues and if it was
                    serious I would fly back to Geneva to see what was happening. I got to Geneva
                    and made an appointment through the embassy for a nine o'clock meeting at the
                    Soviet mission in and my publicity man for USIA (United States Information
                    Agency) said to me, “Your meeting will be over at ten o'clock,” and I said, “How
                    do you know?” and he said, “He's got a press conference at 10:15.” So I went at
                    nine o'clock thinking I'd have an hour there. Actually I did not ask John Tower
                    or Mike Glitman to join me. I asked Shultz whether I should and Shultz said,
                    “No, you were invited. He didn't ask them.” So I went alone and I can tell you
                    we didn't break up until 12:15.” At ten o'clock I looked at my watch and I said
                    to him, “You know you've got a press conference scheduled,” and he said,
                    “They've got nothing to do except to wait for me,” and we continued talking.</p>
                <pb facs="0140" n="Page0140"/>
                <p>It was clear to me that he was concerned about on the remaining issues between us
                    and he didn't understand why we were taking the positions we were taking. I did
                    my best to discuss these with him; he didn't obviously believe he was getting
                    our story from his delegation. I gave him the story and there was no doubt in my
                    mind he accepted what I was saying. I was not bluff; I was straight with him. As
                    a matter of fact, I remember at one time during the discussion getting to some
                    naval issues and I said to him, “Mr. Minister, I have to tell you I don't really
                    myself understand the U.S. position on this particular issue. It's highly
                    technical; I don't understand it.” But, I continued, “I know our navy feels very
                    strongly about this and it's inconceivable to me that President Reagan would
                    overrule the navy on something like this, and I don't see how your navy is hurt
                    in the slightest by what we're doing.” I explained to him, “We have
                    international obligations and we have a different kind of a navy than you have,”
                    and he listened.</p>
                <p>At one point, for example, on the ABM Treaty I mentioned something to him about
                    the ABM treaty's Agreed Statement D; he had never heard of Agreed Statement D. I
                    had an interpreter with me and he had an interpreter with him, so I had our
                    interpreter read agreed statement D to him in English and in Russian and he had
                    never heard of it. He asked his interpreter to go in and get the Russian version
                    of the ABM Treaty, which was interesting because I learned - I don't know how to
                    say this, but I learned in Madrid that I had to see what the Russian
                    translations were.</p>
                <p>I don't know if I ever mentioned to you that I had a linguist from the State
                    Department come out to Geneva, at the end - after we thought we had the whole
                    agreement ready - and I had him read the Russian version. He came up with about
                    fifty areas where he would differ with the Russian translation from the American
                    translation. I remember saying to Kondrashev, “We can't accept this. We won't go
                    along with this.” He said, “You have no right to judge our language,” and I
                    said, “I have every right to see whether there is consistency between your
                    language and my language,” and I said, “You better work with my translator and
                    get something settled.” So I learned about this.</p>
                <p>Shevardnadze got the Russian version and he looked at it and it was what I was
                    saying it was. He said, “I don't think Gorbachev knows about this.” This
                    statement, if I can just take a minute of your time, provided, in my opinion,
                    the basis for an agreement. I explained to Shevardnadze that Nixon was the one
                    who proposed the ABM Treaty to the Soviets whYou didn't want it and resisted it.
                    Now, I said, “The reason you resisted it is because you were working on this
                    problem. So a compromise was worked out. After the ABM Treaty there was to be a
                    series of agreed statements-” (end of tape)</p>
                <pb facs="0141" n="Page0141"/>
                <p>One of those agreed statements was Agreed Statement D. What does Agreed Statement
                    D say? I don't have the specific text in front of me, but Statement D says that
                    the ABM Treaty is applicable only to the technology of the moment and not to new
                    technologies. We agreed to Agreed Statement D. Our ABM program is not the
                    technology of the moment, it's new technologies. We were not violating the ABM
                    Treaty. This was then and remains now my personal position. I could never get
                    the Department of Defense to agree with this, even though this was a way to
                    support. The Defense Department wanted to get out of the ABM Treaty and I didn't
                    think it was necessary to get out of the ABM Treaty to pursue our missile
                    defense program. This gives you an idea of the relationship with
                    Shevardnadze.</p>
                <p>In Reykjavik, for example, I think we were there for three days. On the last day
                    things were at loggerheads and Gorbachev and Reagan recessed for lunch. Shultz
                    and Shevardnadze remained and called together our delegation, including
                    Akromayev, who was the head of the Joint Chiefs of Russia. We were trying to
                    come up with something that might salvage the situation and I remember
                    Shevardnadze turning to me, and after long discussions that we had, and trying
                    here and there to make them shift saying, “You're a creative person. Why don't
                    you come up with something here that'll solve this problem?” Curiously, we did
                    come up with something. It was not my idea, but Richard Perle's. He came up with
                    something very creative, which both Shultz and Shevardnadze thought had some
                    merit. As a matter of fact, all of us around the table thought it had some
                    merit. It was creative.</p>
                <p>Just then the President was driving up from Reykjavik back to our meeting and we
                    all ran down to the room where Reagan was and the Secretary said, “Richard has
                    something to propose to you to consider, Mr. President, that we [in the U.S.]
                    agreed to, and it makes sense for you to consider.” And Reagan said, “Now, You
                    all think that what I'm about to hear I ought to take seriously?” and everybody
                    said yes. Richard Pearle began the process of explaining when the door opened
                    and Gorbachev waltzed in as if he owned the room. He walked right in and we
                    couldn't continue talking, so we went out and two hours later the meeting broke
                    up. I frequently thought to myself, 'what if we'd had another fifteen minutes?
                    Maybe it could have been different.'</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you were doing these things in Geneva, what was your
                        reaction initially, and then as it progressed to the Strategic Defense
                        Initiative known as Star Wars? A lot of people in the United States were
                        saying this is pie in the sky. The science was extremely complicated. What
                        was your preparation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: Well, you have to understand that before I went out to Geneva I had a
                    deputy who was an expert - he really was, Hank Cooper; a difficult personality,
                    but really an engineer who knew his stuff. So not only was I briefed in
                    Washington by the Defense Department, Arms Control Agency, and Cooper, but also
                    I flew out to our labs and was briefed where fundamental research was taking
                    place.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0142" n="Page0142"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Livermore probably. Well, anyway, in California.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: I went to both of them and I got briefed by their experts. I want to
                    say that I didn't have the slightest doubt in my mind that this was serious and
                    feasible. Also Abramson persuaded me that the Russians had a similar program. As
                    I told you earlier, Abramson told the Russian generals where they were doing
                    their work on missile defenses, and they obviously thought that it was a good
                    program. Interestingly enough, the Russians made a proposal at the United
                    Nations during the course of these negotiations that there be an international
                    defense system developed. They didn't follow through on it. To answer your
                    question, I have no doubt in my mind that this was not pie in the sky, and that
                    it was necessary. Otherwise I would not have participated.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the whole Geneva process proceed?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: It proceeded. We met formally, I recall, three times a week. We met
                    informally whenever we could. But the fact of the matter is that the deal was
                    not made in Geneva. The deal was made in private conferences between Shultz and
                    Shevardnadze, with their technical assistants present at each time. They're the
                    ones who ironed out the differences which were then reflected in Geneva, but the
                    fundamental work was done between the two and the experts the two brought along.
                    For example, Shevardnadze depended a great deal on General Akromayev, who was
                    the Chief of Staff, and who, interestingly enough, later committed suicide, and
                    Shultz depended a great deal on Paul Nitze. I placed my two cents in it, not
                    because I was a technician, but because I am a realist in the negotiating
                    approach. I was present at all of these sessions - Shultz wanted me at all of
                    these sessions - and together we'd come up with ideas, test them and come up
                    with the agreement.</p>
                <pb facs="0143" n="Page0143"/>
                <p>Of the fundamental questions, the first one that broke was down the agreement to
                    go down to zero on INF. Now that was, interestingly enough, Dick Perle's idea.
                    Dick submitted it to the President and the President bought it. I have to say to
                    you that the one thing that was clear to me from the beginning of Geneva, as far
                    as I was concerned, was that Ronald Reagan wanted to go down to zero for
                    everything and nobody else agreed with him in the administration. Shultz didn't
                    agree with him, Weinberger didn't agree with him, Ken Adelman didn't; nobody
                    wanted to go down to zero. The Congressional leadership didn't agree with him.
                    As a matter of fact, after Reykjavik Sam Nunn got a hold of me and asked, “Is it
                    true that they came close to going down to zero?” I said, “It's true. He called
                    it a close call, because he didn't think we should go down to zero. Al Gore
                    didn't think we should go down to zero. They were all part of the Senatorial
                    observer group that I worked with. But Reagan wanted to go down to zero. As a
                    matter of fact, I remember Al Gore saying to me that zero was impossible; the
                    Russians would never accept it, and that Perle had recommended it only as a way
                    of killing the deal. I differed with that because I knew Perle quite well and I
                    knew when he was bluffing and I knew when he was serious. We pushed for zero and
                    we meant zero, out of the INF.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: “INF,” this is?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: Intermediate Nuclear Forces.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Basically this was the SS-20 and that whole thing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: Fundamentally that's what gave rise to the SS-20 that gave rise to our
                    response with Pershings and cruise missiles.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which was the last real crises between the two
                        superpowers.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: Reagan was firm about it and we got down to zero, in spite of the
                    skeptics who said this was just a negotiating device by him to kill the deal.
                    This was an important step for us. We ended up, in START, the longer range
                    missiles, with approximately fifty percent reductions, which is the first time
                    we've ever had any kind of a deal reducing rather than putting restrictions on
                    nuclear weapons. I felt very good to be a part of that process.</p>
                <pb facs="0144" n="Page0144"/>
                <p>Relationships developed very well. Bill Crowe, who was then the Chairman of the
                    Joint Chiefs, developed a very good relationship with Akromayev and I remember
                    he invited Akromayev to visit the United States. Crowe was the host and took him
                    around the country and also took him on a battleship. After he finished his tour
                    a few of us met with him and Crowe. It really seemed to me that he was impressed
                    with what he saw. He had no knowledge of how overwhelming our power was,
                    particularly our navy. I remember a statement he made: “I used to be critical of
                    our navy for wanting more money all the time.” He says, “Now I understand.” What
                    impressed him, interestingly enough, was not only the modernity of what we had,
                    but in the navy the fact that we had women sailors and he saw women soldiers.
                    This really impressed him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I've interviewed Admiral Crowe and he was saying that
                        Akromayev was very impressed when he went to an air force base and met women
                        mechanics. He thought maybe these were trotted out to make him look good and
                        he was talking to pilots and the pilots would say, “No, this is for real. My
                        life depends on the ability of these [women].” So I think he put his finger
                        on where the real power anybody - I speak as a former enlisted man - knows
                        in any military is that is our real strength is in the non- commissioned
                        officer corps, and the Soviet system does not produce a very good
                        non-commissioned officer. It's still sort of a brutish type of thing.
                        They've got a lot more officers and not many non-commissioned. Our real
                        strength is the expertise and the ability of the non-commissioned
                        officers.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: Well he learned that. In any event, those are the things that are in
                    my mind.</p>
                <p>Now, in time, therefore, the Geneva negotiations turned into formalities. The
                    real substantive negotiations were outside of the Geneva talks. Now, when it
                    came to the detailed drafting of the treaties that's when Geneva again was
                    vital, because there is where we had the experts, on both sides, and we weren't
                    going to be misled on technicalities. And this took a lot of time.</p>
                <p>Now in that connection, I think I mentioned the early problem of the Senate and
                    Senator Byrd and the observer group. I want to say that the observer group was
                    extremely helpful to us when it came time to ratify INF and START. They felt
                    they were in on everything because we briefed them fully, and therefore that
                    procedure worked.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, in a way the lesson learned from the League of
                        Nations and Wilson's refusal to allow Lodge and other Republican senators to
                        get involved was well learned by this point.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0145" n="Page0145"/>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: Reagan understood this and some of the others did not. As a matter of
                    fact, another illustration occurs to me. I told you we had a tremendous sendoff
                    at a big breakfast at the White House and that Reagan had the top people in the
                    House and Senate there etc. I got to Geneva and a week or so later I got a call
                    from the deputy secretary of state, Ken Dam, who said, “Max, George wanted me to
                    alert you that you may be called back to Washington by the President, for a
                    couple of days.” I said, “Why?” and he then said, “Well, we're in trouble on the
                    M-X (Missile-X) missiles. There's a piece of legislation; twenty-six M-X
                    missiles that are coming up and there is strong opposition.” Max Friedersdorf,
                    the legislative man at the White House, persuaded Reagan that we need help and
                    he's thinking of you.” I said, “It's bad. I just got shipped off with a
                    bi-partisan consensus and all of a sudden you're bringing me back to do some
                    partisan lobbying.” I said, “That's not good.” He said, “George agrees with you
                    and George expressed himself to that effect, but I don't know. I want to alert
                    you.”</p>
                <p>On Friday night, Geneva time, I got a call from Max Friedersdorf: “The President
                    would like to see you on Monday morning.” I said, “It's on this M-X?” and he
                    said, “Yeah, it's on the M-X.” I said, “Well, okay; if the President wants to
                    see me, I'll be there,” and I remember saying to him, “It's Friday night. If you
                    want me to be there, I've got to fly the Concorde.” He said, “You've got
                    authority to fly the Concorde from London.” So I took the Concorde. On Monday
                    morning I went to the White House. I was given a list of Congressmen I was to
                    see in the Capitol. I looked and I didn't see Tip O'Neil, who was the speaker of
                    the house, and I said, “Where's Tip O'Neil?” The response was, “Oh no. He's
                    leading the opposition.” So I said, “You know, I'm not going to set foot into
                    that House of Representatives without first talking to Tip O'Neil.” That got him
                    all nervous, and I was firm. So they located Tip O'Neil. It was about eight
                    o'clock in the morning. I knew Tip O'Neil. I had been active in the Democratic
                    Party and he knew Humphrey. I didn't know Tip O'Neil well, but I knew him, and I
                    knew as a matter of courtesy I wasn't going to walk into the House of
                    Representatives.</p>
                <p>My first appointment was with Tip O'Neil. I explained my presence and we talked.
                    He said, “How many votes are you short?” and I responded. He opened up his desk
                    and took out a piece of paper. He said: “You're shorter than that. It's worse
                    than that.” And then we talked as friends - not intimate friends, but we talked.
                    Mostly what was concerning him was the deterioration in American politics - the
                    hostilities that were growing, the tensions, and the fact that every member of
                    the Congress wanted to be President of the United States - the way he put it -
                    instead of understanding the virtue of being in service as a member of Congress.
                    And then he said, “Are you going to see Michael today?” - the Republican leader
                    - and I said, “Yes, I have an appointment to see Michael, too.” “Well, he says,
                    “you talk to him. He agrees with me fully that this crew is just terrible.” I
                    had been told earlier that he had a sister who was a nun, a sister, at one of
                    the church organizations for peace - a church organization or something like
                    that.</p>
                <pb facs="0146" n="Page0146"/>
                <p>I made my rounds - Democrats and Republicans - and I smelled, during my rounds,
                    more favorable reactions from the Democrats. Tip O'Neil seemed to be quietly
                    helping. I had said to him: “You know, Tip, this kind of politics of trying to
                    kill the system is not the function of the Congress.” And I said, “The
                    Democratic Party, to the best of my knowledge, has never tried to kill the
                    system. We may think too much money or too little money is being spent on
                    something, but we don't want to kill the system.” And he listened. Anyhow, I
                    began to smell a little bit better atmosphere. My theme was that we should not
                    unilaterally give up a weapon system without getting the Soviets to
                    reciprocate.</p>
                <p>At the end of the day I went to see the President and said, “Mr. President, I
                    have very little doubt in my mind that Tip helped me with Democrats today.” I
                    said, “I just have a smell that he helped me.” He picked up the phone and said,
                    “Get me Tip O'Neil.” I only heard one part of the conversation, filled with “You
                    dumb Irishman” - to Tip O'Neil. “What in the hell got into you? I hear you were
                    polite to my man, Max.” Two Irish friends cussing each other out. These were
                    obviously two friends.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well that was part of the Irish mafia there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: That's right. It was part of the Irish mafia. Again, we never heard of
                    this Reagan in the newspapers. But I'm only telling you what I heard.</p>
                <p>My schedule showed a Reagan press conference on his agenda. We finished talking
                    and we walked outside toward, I believe, the East Room. I walked in with the
                    President and encountered endless numbers of Members of Congress, and the press.
                    The room was filled with Democrats and Republicans - and journalists. And on the
                    platform were George Shultz and Cap Weinberger and the Vice President. We walked
                    up and there's a chair for me on that platform, - a full press with cameras.</p>
                <p>The President went to the microphone and said, “I guess there's no need for me to
                    introduce Max to you. Max, why don't you come here and talk?” Just like that.
                    “Can you come and tell them what you were doing today,” or something like that.
                    I can tell you I was not prepared. I didn't have the slightest idea. And I now
                    remember saying, “Mr. President, I'm pleased to have the chance to say what I
                    was doing today,” but I said, “I see friends in the audience here, I didn't
                    expect to be here. I am in Washington to discuss the MX missile and I see some
                    people in the audience who, I think, are opposed to it. Your position and my
                    position, Mr. President, are the same, but Mr. President, I want you to know
                    that every one of these people, whether they're for the MX or against the MX, is
                    an American patriot who wants to do what's right for the United States.” And I
                    said, “If we have any differences, these are not differences that are
                    fundamental for the safety of this country,” which of course was what I should
                    say, and this is what I talked about. It's one really outstanding experience of
                    my life. And then I went back to Geneva. The MX passed the House by a narrow
                    margin, and it's there.</p>
                <pb facs="0147" n="Page0147"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You might explain MX for somebody who doesn't know.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: I'm not technical. It was an intercontinental weapon. The point I was
                    making at my speech was, and with everybody I talked to, that I thought we ought
                    to get rid of the MX, but only as part of a treaty with the Soviet Union, and
                    not unilaterally. That was the thrust of my talk with Tip O'Neil; that was the
                    thrust of my talk wherever I went to, and that was the thrust of my talk to the
                    Congressmen and to the press. I didn't want to give up anything without getting
                    something in return, and that's why, as a negotiator, I had agreed to come down.
                    I'm glad you asked me that because that was the thrust of my report.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were sensing real movement in this because we had been
                        going for maybe twenty or more years on various talks, which was sort of an
                        exercise in - well, it wasn't in futility completely because an awful lot of
                        the aspects were turned over and over to so many people. It was a training
                        exercise, almost. But nothing was happening. But it took the combination of
                        Gorbachev and Reagan to get this moving.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: Yes, it did. And, I want to say, Shultz and Shevardnadze. There's no
                    question about it. They were together and they greatly respected each other.
                    They liked each other. To the best of my knowledge, I have reason to believe
                    they're still in touch with each other.</p>
                <p>If I could drop a footnote about Shultz. There was a meeting scheduled in Moscow
                    between Shultz and Shevardnadze. I was scheduled to go to Moscow with them; as a
                    matter of fact, a number of us were going. I was Counselor then also. It
                    happened to coincide with the Jewish holiday of Passover, and Richard Shifter,
                    who was then the Assistant Secretary of State in human rights - with whom I'm
                    having dinner tonight - talked to me about an idea he had. He was going to
                    Moscow also, the visit coincided with a Passover Seder in the Moscow embassy
                    that night, that Hartman was organizing.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Mr. Hartman, our ambassador.</hi>

                <pb facs="0148" n="Page0148"/>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: Yes. Many Jewish Refuseniks who were not in jail were invited. Dick
                    had the idea and discussed it with me, and I took it up with Shultz - that
                    Shultz should come to the Seder since he was going to be in Moscow. I talked to
                    Shultz about that and Shultz said, “That's a great idea,” and he told Ros
                    Ridgway, who was our Assistant Secretary, to arrange the schedule so that he
                    could be at the American embassy for dinner that night. Ros said he was
                    scheduled to have dinner with Shevardnadze. Shultz said, “Explain to
                    Shevardnadze that I can't have dinner with him, but I'll see him after that;
                    that I want to go to the Jewish Passover Seder,” which he did. Shultz went. I
                    did not go because I had a heart attack two or three days before this. I had an
                    unexpected, sudden heart attack. Before going to Moscow, Shultz stopped by my
                    house - I had just gotten out of the hospital - to see if I had any last minute
                    requests of him, which was thoughtful. That was a great event, that Seder, from
                    what everybody tells me. As a matter of fact, one of the people who Shultz met
                    that night, whose name escapes me, continues, to this day, to communicate with
                    him and correspond with Shultz. I believe it is Eva Nudel. She is now in Israel
                    and she had a great impact on him. She talked at the Seder. At any rate, you can
                    see symbolically what it did in Moscow. The Secretary of State of the United
                    States was there. And it was good for Gorbachev and Shevardnadze to know that he
                    had gone to the Seder.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing at the end?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: Well, at the end I was doing two jobs, mostly Counselor work, because
                    the treaty principles were worked out. When tensions arose, I'd go back. And
                    there were such times. As a matter of fact, there was one occasion toward the
                    end when we were not far apart. We had a meeting scheduled between Shultz and
                    Shevardnadze in Geneva. They met periodically, not only about these talks, but
                    about other things as well.</p>
                <p>I went to bed that night and I thought we had had a deal; everybody was agreed to
                    it and the technicians were writing the words on that issue. It was an INF
                    issue, if I remember correctly. I was tired. I always tried to fly during the
                    day, but this time I flew out there with Shultz and we flew all night; so I was
                    tired. For the first time in my life, I took a sleeping pill and went to sleep.
                    At about three or four o'clock in the morning Charlie Hill called me and woke me
                    at my apartment. My wife and I kept the apartment, even though I was also now
                    Counselor as well. Charlie said, “The talks are breaking up. They've broken up
                    in order to go back and talk to the principals and George says he'd like you to
                    go down there and settle it if you can. I'm sending a car for you.” So I woke up
                    and went back and I settled it. We got it done so that by the morning meeting,
                    which was supposed to be the final meeting, we had an agreement. But it did
                    occasionally require me to go back and forth and try to be a bit creative about
                    some of these issues. But I was then Counselor, so I was doing, in effect, all
                    things; and as Counselor I was doing anything that came up. I was making
                    occasional public talks as well.</p>
                <pb facs="0149" n="Page0149"/>
                <p>I met with Shultz at least twice a day when he was in town. We met together in
                    the morning with him and John Whitehead, and other senior officials. We met
                    every morning and every evening. The rule was that at least one of us had to be
                    in Washington at a time. We all agreed that we would want our schedules
                    coordinated. Even though I was low man on the totem pole - I think I was number
                    three on the totem pole by the statute, but realistically I think I looked upon
                    myself as number four and not number three. But I remember even as number three
                    there were a couple of days when all the cables went out from Washington, to all
                    the world, signed Kampelman instead of Shultz. We'd talk about whatever came up.
                    We met with Members of Congress when necessary. He asked me to go down to
                    Central America on three occasions, which I did. I think I've reported that
                    here. I had a fascinating experience. John Whitehead and I became lasting
                    friends; we're still in touch with each other. Shultz and I became lasting
                    friends. It was a pleasant and satisfying experience.</p>
                <p>One issue came up that was important and involved the current crisis, the Middle
                    East. Shultz came to me one day - he may have come to my office or I may have
                    gone to his office; I don't remember now; I think I went to his office - and he
                    said, “You've seen the American embassy in Israel in Tel Aviv?” and I said,
                    “Yes, I have.” He continued, “It's a security risk. It's a safety risk. It's a
                    disgrace for us to have an embassy in an office building with a public garage
                    down below, facing an ocean where we're vulnerable. The ambassador's office is
                    vulnerable to shots from the sea that might come from some ship?” He continued:
                    “We need a new embassy and I'm told Jesse Helms won't go along with a new
                    embassy. Will you go talk to him?” This was after the Latin American matter that
                    I described in an earlier tape where Jesse Helms, and I were sitting next to
                    each other on an airplane. Do you remember that?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, I do.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0150" n="Page0150"/>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: Shultz felt I had a relationship with Jesse Helms. So I went to see
                    Jesse Helms and discussed it with him. He said he was fully aware. He had been
                    to Israel, he had seen it, and he thought the embassy was a disgrace. He said,
                    “You tell George that if he tells me how much money he needs, I'll support it. I
                    won't ask any questions. I'll arrange to see that he gets every dime he wants in
                    the building of a new embassy, but it's got to be in Jerusalem and not in Tel
                    Aviv. I will not agree to a new embassy in Tel Aviv.” I said, “Look, Senator, I
                    also think the embassy should be in Jerusalem. In every country where we do
                    business in the world our embassy is at the seat of government. The seat of
                    government is in Jerusalem and I'm for having our embassy in Jerusalem.” “But,”
                    I said, “that's not the administration's position.” He said, “Well, an
                    overwhelming number in the Congress would support the embassy being moved to
                    Jerusalem.” I said, “I know and I am against what the administration's position
                    is, personally, on it, but the administration's position is until there is a
                    peace agreement, they aren't going to build the embassy in Jerusalem.” Anyhow,
                    within a half hour we had a deal, subject to Shultz's approval. It required that
                    we would be asking for new buildings in Tel Aviv and in Jerusalem. Both
                    buildings would be adequate to be an embassy. Tel Aviv had the army and the
                    business community and Jerusalem had the seat of government. So we were to build
                    two buildings and they wouldn't be wasted because we needed to build them.
                    Actually, there was no proper building in Jerusalem for the consulate. That was
                    the deal.</p>
                <p>I went back to Shultz and Shultz said he thought it made sense, but he was going
                    to check it out with Dick Murphy, the assistant secretary for Near Eastern
                    affairs. Well, the bureau opposed it. I was for it. Shultz decided to support my
                    position and he said to me, “Murphy tells me that the Arab world is going to be
                    terribly unhappy about this and that we're going to get a flow of protests from
                    the ambassadors. You're going to talk to those ambassadors, not me.” Let me say
                    here that only one ambassador came. The plan passed the Congress and only one
                    ambassador came, the Egyptian, who said to me he wasn't opposing it; he wanted
                    an explanation - which was interesting, and I reported that.</p>
                <p>We then set out to work. We had a real estate expert, Nick Salgo, who owned the
                    Watergate, a dollar a year man for the government temporarily. He was a big
                    contributor to Reagan. I arranged for him to go out to find locations in
                    Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, and he did. Regrettably, the place he found in Tel Aviv
                    was a place that was vetoed by the Israeli government because it was near the
                    Israeli intelligence operation north of Tel Aviv. To this day we haven't built
                    anything in Jerusalem even though he found a splendid location. The legislation,
                    at White House direction after we left the government, permitted the President
                    to declare a temporary waiver.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What sort of groups would you be talking to as
                        Counselor?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0151" n="Page0151"/>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: I didn't do that much, but I did some. I did some talking overseas,
                    for example, in London, in Paris, when they wanted somebody to speak about the
                    negotiations. I could do that; I did that in my role as Counselor. In the United
                    States I met with many delegations that were coming into Washington to see the
                    Secretary. If the Secretary wouldn't see them, I frequently saw them. I spoke
                    around the country on foreign policy in universities. That was not a major
                    effort, but I was there to do some of that when the Secretary was invited and
                    could or should not accept.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well with the arms control at the final Geneva accords,
                        were the French on board?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: They were on board. Let me just say about that what I indicated in
                    Madrid where we had a very effective NATO caucus. Let me tell you that for the
                    Geneva talks I went to Brussels before every single session and I went to
                    Brussels at the end of every single session. I briefed NATO on those talks. On
                    one or two occasions where the sessions might last a long time, I would arrange
                    to go to the NATO in between; in the middle of a session. I kept NATO fully
                    informed and, therefore, we didn't have the slightest problem, and that included
                    the French. No problems. As a matter of fact, I made some very good friendships
                    among the NATO's secretariat. Renaldo Petrinani was the number two man in
                    Brussels under that old long-time head, the Dutchman. Renaldo Petrinani later
                    became the Italian ambassador to Washington. We remain friends to this day.
                    We're both on the board at Georgetown University's Institute for the Study of
                    Diplomacy. I kept NATO fully informed. I would not only keep them informed, but
                    if they had any ideas I wanted to hear them. They generally did not get
                    involved, but they wanted to be informed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During this time that you were working with the Reagan
                        Administration, what were your relations with the vice president, George
                        Bush?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: Excellent. Frequently - as a matter of fact, it became a pattern, I
                    think - I would come in and brief the president. The vice president would
                    occasionally be there. When he was not, I moved. The vice president would also
                    ask me to come in and brief him privately. Our relationships were excellent. I
                    think I mentioned to you, but maybe I didn't, how kind he was to me on a rainy
                    day at the first Gorbachev meeting in Washington.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, you mentioned that.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0152" n="Page0152"/>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: He looked upon me as a friend, so the relationships were good. When he
                    became president I supported him in the Iraq Crisis. There weren't many
                    Democrats who supported him in the Gulf. Al Gore was one. I supported him and I
                    tried to help him, and he appreciated it. Curiously, I remember the first time I
                    saw him as President he took me on a tour of the residence of the White House. I
                    had not seen previously seen the residences until Bush took me through there.
                    Incidentally, out of one of the rooms Reverend Billy Graham, who was obviously a
                    guest at the White House for that day, came to greet us. He had slept over night
                    there. What interested me was a side comment he made to me, which was, “You
                    know, Barbara and I were never up here before.” That was interesting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ronald Reagan was a great sort of friend but nobody he was
                        close to, not even his kids.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: That's right. The fact that the Vice President was never invited to
                    the residence was telling to me. Now I have not seen much of George Bush since
                    he left the presidency, although once I visited him and his wife in Maine, just
                    for a few hours.</p>
                <p>Let me also say that during the Bush presidency I was called on four times, I
                    think, to spend a month for Jim Baker on CSCE meetings that were going to take
                    place based on agreements that I had made in Madrid. One was on nationalities,
                    one was on family reunification, one was on immigration and human rights. I
                    think I've talked about that at one point here, including the one in Moscow
                    dealing with McDonald's restaurant.</p>
                <p>The Copenhagen meeting, which I think was one of the great historic meetings in
                    international relations, we came out with a document which three international
                    law professors whom I know called the most important international human rights
                    document since the Magna Carta. That Copenhagen document is superb. In order to
                    solidify the Copenhagen meeting, I helped push a recommendation that there be a
                    meeting of the heads of states to ratify, and it's called the Agreement of
                    Paris, and the meeting took place in Paris. Baker invited me to the Paris
                    meeting; he thought I ought to be at the meeting. I did not sit in on decisions,
                    but I was in at the meeting. And they did ratify it. At the end of the last
                    session there were a lot of people around from different countries - you know,
                    thirty-five countries - and Barbara Bush saw me and called out, “Max,” and asked
                    me to come over. We embraced and then the President came by. I had not seen him
                    at all during this two or three days, and she shouted, “George, here's Max.” He
                    came over and she said, “He's responsible for this meeting,” which I didn't know
                    she knew, but it was interesting. He said, “I know, I know.” It was very nice.
                    Not that I've seen them much, but they were very nice.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm looking at this and what I suggest we do?I assume you
                        left the Counselor job at the end of the Reagan Administration.</hi>

                <p>KAMPELMAN: Oh, yes. I told Baker that I was leaving.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So what I thought we would do is maybe stop at this point.
                        We'll have another session which we'll be talking about your time after
                        leaving the Reagan presidency, and we'll talk about NGOs.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>***</p>
                <p>Max, let's talk about your time afterward. What sort of NGOs (Non-Governmental
                    Organizations) have you been involved with?</p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: Well, before my diplomatic service I was involved with a few
                    Jewish-Israeli organizations; the Anti-Defamation League was one. I think I
                    became a vice chairman of that, or something like that. Mostly, as far as Israel
                    is concerned, I kept out of its politics, but I joined the board of the American
                    Friends of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and became its chairman, and I
                    also joined the Board of Trustees of the university itself. I became quite
                    active in the university. Indeed, they have a chair in my name, which they
                    created, which was good. And then I also became Chairman of the Jerusalem
                    Foundation, Mayor Teddy Kollek of Jerusalem enlisted me for that assignment.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was a very, very influential figure.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: He asked me if I would assume the chairmanship of the Jerusalem
                    Foundation in the United States, and I did.</p>
                <p>After Madrid, Freedom House asked me to join the board, which I agreed to do, and
                    then to serve as chairman, which I agreed to do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Would you explain what Freedom House is?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0154" n="Page0154"/>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: Freedom House was an organization created at the beginning of the
                    Second World War. It was an organization created by Eleanor Roosevelt and
                    Wendell Wilke to advance the cause of freedom in the world, including in the
                    United States. It was a bipartisan effort. We just recently celebrated our
                    sixtieth anniversary. I think this organization was extremely helpful in
                    strengthening the democratic elements, mostly in Eastern Europe and in the
                    Soviet Union. It did so with some minor funds, but mostly with encouragement and
                    training and vision. Apparently the then leadership, which consisted of Leo
                    Cherne, who was a very distinguished American during my day there, and Leonard
                    Sussman, who was the executive director; they asked me to serve on the board and
                    then to serve as chairman. They liked the Madrid meeting and felt that it was
                    helpful to them. I'm now chairman emeritus and still very active in the
                    organization.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What type of things is it getting involved with now, since
                        the whole terrain has changed so much?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: At the moment Freedom House has adopted an op-ed piece that I wrote in
                    the Washington Times somewhat more than a year ago. And now I am putting in a
                    great deal of time, along with Mark Palmer, in pushing the concept that the
                    Helsinki Final Act, as we worked it out in Madrid, should expand itself into the
                    Mediterranean area. When I was in Madrid it consisted of only thirty-five
                    countries, which was thirty-three European countries plus the United States and
                    Canada. Today it's fifty-five because with the breakup of the Soviet Union, new
                    Central Asian countries asked to be a part of it, were invited into and ended up
                    joining. Now our project is to move south, as well as to strengthen what they
                    now call the OSCE, rather than the CSCE, in the areas of Central Asia.</p>
                <p>I don't know if I ever went into this philosophy of the Madrid meeting that I had
                    with you. Stop me if I have. I don't want to repeat myself. But when I was given
                    the invitation to head up our delegation in Madrid, I was advised by a number of
                    people not to take it because it was nothing but a Soviet front, they said to
                    me. But when I was teaching at the University of Minnesota a book came out -
                    Gunnar Myrdahl. Did I discuss that?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think you did.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0155" n="Page0155"/>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: Well, let's put that aside. What I learned in Madrid was that it's
                    very important to take advantage of an “ought.” The Helsinki Final Act asserted
                    the ways countries ought to behave. We then would have a right to say, “Move
                    your 'is' to the 'ought'.” Now there is no ought in the North African
                    Mediterranean area and our concept is to get the 'ought' broadened into the
                    Mediterranean; Mark Palmer and I have now met on the plan with about a dozen
                    ambassadors; we had lunch with all of the Scandinavian ambassadors. We were
                    pleased when the prime minister of Denmark supported the plan at a speech here
                    in Washington. So that's the kind of thing Freedom House does. Regrettably, our
                    White House is killing the opportunity to spread democracy south of Europe.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm wondering, talking about the Mediterranean and all,
                        one looks at the Islamic world, and with the quasi exception of Indonesia,
                        in this whole place there's no real democracy in that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: Well Turkey is a Muslim state. India has more Muslims in it than the
                    Middle East has and India is a democracy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then let's be exclusive. Let's look at Syria, Egypt,
                        Algeria?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: That's the seat now of anti-democratic activity. Freedom House is now
                    helping me to wake up the White House to the opportunity we have. They seems
                    tied in knots on this question.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. You know in a way your work on democracy and all with
                        Eastern Europe was already prepared for you. I mean these were people who
                        had, at a certain point, sort of democratic roots, with the exception of
                        Russia.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: But that's a big exception.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, a huge exception, but the point being that it was
                        almost like speaking to like, but when you start moving into the Islamic
                        world, with the exception of Turkey, which of course had Ataturk which broke
                        away from the rule of Islam, which is still a problem there. You know, these
                        other countries aren't going anywhere.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0156" n="Page0156"/>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: I can tell you that's what they said to me and to others about Russia.
                    “What are you trying to do there? You can't change it.” Yet Russia has changed.
                    We're living in a world where there's a larger percentage of the human race
                    today governed by democracies or near democracies than ever before in known
                    history. And I talk about percentage because obviously a population is a
                    certainty. There are democratic sources that exist even within countries like
                    Saudi Arabia. Egypt goes through a form of election now because they feel under
                    pressure to do so; they're not a democracy. Jordan is closer to a democracy, but
                    even Jordan doesn't quite reach it there. Morocco is moving closer in that area.
                    And we do not minimize at all the fact that the largest number of Muslims in the
                    world live in Indonesia and in India where there is democracy, or relative
                    democracy certainly in India. So we can not accept, and do not accept, the
                    notion that democracy is antithetical to Islam.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: And our job, which is not an easy one, and I don't mean to indicate to
                    you that it's an easy one, is to expend the concept, certainly now into the
                    Mediterranean and maybe into the Gulf states, although that's a slow process.
                    But Qatar today is moving toward democracy. Bahrain is moving toward democracy.
                    These are Gulf states. Anyhow, that's what Freedom House is pushing and I don't
                    mind telling you that in the last two months I have met with three under
                    secretaries of state now in office, two assistant secretaries of state now in
                    office, and have received green lights from all five to continue with our
                    efforts. I have discussed the project with one of the leading members of the
                    National Security Council, who seems attracted to it. The task now is to get the
                    State Department to come in with a recommendation, but that requires
                    imagination.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In practical terms, what are you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: We're meeting with them. We've written a paper, Mark and I, a rather
                    long paper, justifying and setting out how the plan ought to be put into
                    effect.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But how does this impact say in Egypt?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0157" n="Page0157"/>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: Well, we've talked to the Egyptians and they seem agreeable. There are
                    six non-participating Mediterranean states that are part of the Helsinki
                    process. They were present toward the end of the European negotiations. Spain
                    and Malta wanted them to sign in addition to the thirty-five countries, and they
                    were prepared to sign, six of them. Europe, however, since every decision had to
                    be unanimous, said they don't want to add to the East-West task. The East-West
                    problem was what they were creating and they didn't want to bring in a
                    Mediterranean complexity. But all six are listed in the Helsinki Final Act. That
                    includes Egypt, it includes Israel, it includes Morocco, it includes Jordan, it
                    includes Algeria. We now are suggesting that they become full members, if they
                    wish. They want to be invited in and that's what we're asking. And then when
                    they can accept the 'ought' we've moved another step forward towards what may be
                    a long effort.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As you wrestle with the problem with democracy, what
                        happens if elections are held and a religious group gets the majority, which
                        in turn, itself, does not believe in democracy? In other words, once it gets
                        in power then it says Allah has told us to do this and forget about having
                        other elections because we're?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: Well then they can be expelled from the process. The essence of
                    democracy is that a democracy may decide not to be a democracy, through a vote.
                    But for us democracy is not just an election; it's a whole concept of a rule of
                    law. And that's what we're processing. As a matter of fact, what the Helsinki
                    process produced - for example, in Copenhagen where I was asked by Jim Baker to
                    go back for a month and represent the United States even though I was out of the
                    government and finished my Counselor job. He asked me to go back to Copenhagen,
                    to Geneva, to Madrid, to Moscow - one a year, for a month, to help them to
                    strengthen up the Helsinki process. The Copenhagen document has been called by a
                    number of professors of international law - I can think now of three, but there
                    are more than three - the most important international human rights document
                    since the Magna Carta, and it spells out what a democracy means. If anybody was
                    to come and join this process, they would be joining what is apparent, a series
                    of 'oughts;' and that's our task. Once the oughts are there, we have a leg up
                    toward the 'is.' That is also an economic ingredient in the Helsinki process
                    which is attractive.</p>
                <p>A professor of international law at the University of Illinois is this summer
                    preparing for us - he wrote me the other day that he'll have it ready in
                    September - a whole pamphlet setting forth what all the documents of the
                    Helsinki process are saying, so that when country X says, “Well, we're invited
                    to come in. What are our obligations?” it'll all be down in writing what the
                    obligations are. Now, a country can assume obligations and not live up to them,
                    but we're not looking for a magic wand. We're saying if you can get this “ought”
                    in there, we've got a leg up. It strengthens the democratic elements within the
                    country and hopefully is achieved down the road. Anyhow, that's what Freedom
                    House is, one of its activities. I don't know if you've heard of the Community
                    of Democracies.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0158" n="Page0158"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, I haven't.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: That's Freedom House again. This was as a result of a recommendation
                    made by Professor John Norton Moore of the University of Virginia, who used to
                    be a legal adviser in the State Department. He and Mark Palmer came up with an
                    idea to Freedom House's board under which the foreign ministers of the
                    democracies of the world should meet together periodically, discuss their
                    problems, and see about moving forward the whole concept of democracy. I
                    presented this idea to the White House during the Clinton Administration, during
                    the last week, as a matter of fact, of Tony Lake's White House service. I
                    discussed it with him for about an hour and he said, “Max, you've given me the
                    only reason I have to regret leaving this job. I'd like to work on this
                    project.” Tony is now on our board. Sandy Berger adopted it and liked it.
                    Madeleine Albright accepted it and there was a meeting in Warsaw sponsored by
                    the United States, Chile, and Poland, of about 100 foreign ministers who agreed
                    to create a Community of Democracies.</p>
                <p>Interestingly enough, a number of non-democratic foreign ministers showed up,
                    which we, Freedom House, did not like. But they showed up wanting to be part of
                    it. The Community agreed to meet again in Seoul, Korea, which they did last
                    November. This administration thought of it at first as a Madeleine Albright
                    proposal and were not interested in pursuing it, but we persuaded them that this
                    was not a Madeleine Albright proposal - it was a Freedom House proposal - Colin
                    Powell was not able to be there, but he sent Paula Dobriansky, Under Secretary.
                    They've agreed to have another meeting in Chile. Now, I'm not against saying
                    none of these are magic wands, but they're movements, and Freedom House engages
                    in those movements. We now have offices in Eastern Europe and in Central Asia.
                    Anyhow, that was one of my non-governmental organizations that I've spent a lot
                    of time with and still am spending time.</p>
                <p>Now another activity: Freedom House was after Madrid, now I move to after Geneva.
                    There is an organization called the American Academy of Diplomacy. It consists
                    of no more than 100 members. They're supposed to be distinguished Foreign
                    Service officers, mostly of a higher level - I was invited - and I was elected
                    to membership. My name was proposed, there was a mail ballot, and I was elected.
                    I was then asked to serve on the board. I served on the board. Larry Eagleburger
                    was chairman of the board. I attend a board meeting late and Larry was in his as
                    I walked in and Larry said, “Congratulations, Max.” I said, “Congratulations on
                    what?” He said, “We've just elected you my successor.” So I became chairman of
                    the American Academy of Diplomacy. Bruce Laingan, who was our diplomat in charge
                    in Iran during the terrible problems there, was and is the President. I think
                    he's called president. I served in that job until my serious illness and then I
                    got out, but I'm on the board. I do a lot of work with them, meet with them
                    regularly.</p>
                <pb facs="0159" n="Page0159"/>
                <p>Next, Georgetown University has an Institute for the Study of Diplomacy. Ed
                    Muskie, the former senator, was the chairman. The board came to me and asked me
                    if I would succeed Ed Muskie as chairman. I agreed. I served as chairman until
                    last year - I'm still on the board - when I was replaced by Tom Pickering.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: Tom Pickering. Tom is a good friend of mine and a champion diplomat
                    and leader.</p>
                <p>Tom is now the chairman. I've been quite active. We've had meetings, we've
                    studied, we've been active.</p>

                <p>KAMPELMAN: We at Georgetown do a number of things. One of the things is that we
                    take in, every year, people from the State Department, the Defense Department,
                    the CIA - they apply for it - and give them advanced training at Georgetown
                    University. We, at the same time, do studies. We have a staff and we do
                    different studies. We've done studies on the intelligence operation in the U.S.,
                    we're now working on that again to modernize it and make some changes in it.
                    We're not revolutionizing the world, but it's important. We teach classes at the
                    university and it works out quite well.</p>
                <p>Now, I was also chosen by the President to serve on the board of the United
                    States Institute of Peace. I was then asked by the White House and by Sam Lewis,
                    who was then the president, if I would become chairman. I said no, I could not
                    take that; it was just too much for me. They then came back to me afterwards and
                    said would I be willing to serve as vice chairman if Chester Crocker assumed the
                    chairmanship, and I said yes. Chester and I are good friends, and up until last
                    year I was vice chairman. My term expired and under the statute, I had my two
                    terms. But I'm still close to them. Richard Solomon is now its president.
                    Although I'm not on the board I constantly meet with Chester and Dick because
                    we're good friends. So you can see my non-governmental organizations have
                    occupied my time and have been very useful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Looking at this overall, for somebody trying to understand
                        Washington, where do these organizations fit into the projection of American
                        or world foreign policy? How do they work, do you feel?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0160" n="Page0160"/>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: Well, they each have their own unique niche to cover. Freedom House,
                    for example, is much broader non-governmental; although Freedom House has been
                    asked by the State Department, under contract, to engage in a number of
                    democratic activities in the world, and we're doing that. We also become a kind
                    of a pressure group on government, and that's one function of non-governmental
                    organizations. The American Academy of Diplomacy is not academic, but they
                    primarily are designed to strengthen the State Department. They try to help with
                    appropriations; they make themselves available to be helpful. Their experts are
                    available and on call, and frequently are called upon by the State Department to
                    do different chores. The Georgetown project and the U.S. Institute of Peace
                    write papers, do studies, stimulate.</p>
                <p>I left out one very important non-governmental organization, but it's
                    semi-governmental. President Carter - and this was before I went to Madrid -
                    asked me to become chairman of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for
                    Scholars. Now the Woodrow Wilson Center was designed to be the tribute to
                    President Wilson. It was established under the Johnson Administration, toward
                    its very end. Hubert Humphrey was its first chairman. I was its third chairman.
                    The chairman is appointed by the President. The executive director when I was
                    chairman is now the Librarian of Congress, James Billington. The Woodrow Wilson
                    Center is government funded. We brought in scholars from the United States and
                    around the world to discuss questions of war and peace and they spend a year -
                    some less than a year - as fellows. Some of our retired State Department people
                    also move to the Woodrow Wilson Center.</p>
                <p>I thoroughly enjoyed that work; I thought it was important work. And as a
                    practical matter let me say that Madrid came on its heels, while I was chairman.
                    I made a point of returning to Washington for every board meeting, which was
                    four times a year, to work with Jim Billington on these issues. One of our
                    scholars was a Polish scholar, by the Polish, actually, a scholar of ancient
                    Europe, but a scholar in the best sense of that word. He was arrested during
                    Madrid. He associated himself with the Polish solidarity movement, as a liberal
                    scholar. Jim Billington called me on the telephone to tell me that he'd been
                    arrested. I got on the floor of the Madrid meeting and I reported that this
                    outstanding scholar had been arrested, and I publicly said to the Polish
                    delegate that I wanted the government of Poland to know that as far as I was
                    concerned, I could not consider the Polish government to be a civilized
                    government so long as this gentleman and others were in jail. This was when
                    Jaruzelski became the dictator of Poland. And we got him out. As a matter of
                    fact, he became the foreign minister of Poland about five years ago. These are
                    some of the things that we've done. As a matter of fact, when he came to
                    Washington as foreign minister he asked to see me. I met him and he thanked me.
                    I met his wife previously. These are things that one can do with outside
                    activities.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the articles - the op-ed piece in the
                        Washington Times, something on foreign affairs? There's a great deal of
                        emphasis on this, but by looking at this over time, do these penetrate the
                        power circle - the NSC (National Security Council), the State Department,
                        the Defense Department?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0161" n="Page0161"/>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: It's a good question. I think it varies. Some articles do penetrate.
                    Some annoy and sometimes have an influence, even with their annoyance. I would
                    say that a columnist who is published throughout the country has greater
                    influence than the occasional op-ed piece that I might write, for example, and
                    as you know, I write quite a few of those. I would think an outstanding column
                    or a television personality who has greater influence because it might produce
                    greater political influence. But I do feel some take it seriously. I use this
                    illustration now: the Community of Democracies which became government policy,
                    and is today government policy, the next meeting will be in El Salvador. I
                    talked about what I'm doing with extending the Helsinki Final Act. As I say, I
                    know the upper levels of the State Department are now considering it seriously
                    and giving it serious thought, because I've met with them. Sometimes it just
                    goes by the board. But, you know, I have found that practically everything I
                    have written - and I have written quite a bit - brings some response.</p>
                <p>Now, for example, let me turn to the ABM treaty: I, in Geneva, came up with
                    certain ideas about the ABM treaty and missile defenses. I left the government
                    and a new president came in now, Bush. I wrote a piece about it, giving my
                    version of what ought to be done, based on my experience. Ken Adelman, close to
                    this new administration and former head of ACTA, called me on the telephone and
                    said, “Good article, Max,” - he knew what my view was - and he said, “The new
                    counsel at the Defense Department is a friend of mine. Would you be willing to
                    have lunch with him?” I said, “Of course.” So the three of us had lunch and I
                    talked about it. They did not follow my recommendation, and I think they would
                    have been better off had they done so. I had lunch at the White House with a
                    friend who knew my views, who saw my piece, who commented on my piece, and at
                    lunch said, “Did you read the president's statement on missile defense?” and I
                    said, “I did,” and he said to me, “Did anything sound familiar to you?” with a
                    smile; and I said, “Yes, I recognized some of it.” But I said, “As a matter of
                    fact, he left out some of it, too,” which he laughed at.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course. Your experience over many years in working in
                        the Washington foreign affairs thing, you can penetrate at certain points by
                        these organizations, by contacts, by writing, and all that.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0162" n="Page0162"/>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: You can. For example, I made a speech a couple of months ago before a
                    group of rather significant influential people at a meeting called by David
                    Abshire, who was a former ambassador of NATO and a former head of the CSIS. If I
                    must say so myself, I worked on the speech and it was a damn good speech. David,
                    I think, arranged for it to be published in a magazine called Vital Speeches of
                    the Day. I've now had four or five speeches of mine published by them and that
                    gets wide distribution. Every library in the country uses it and every library
                    in every university uses it because it's a research source. I can tell you from
                    the mail I've gotten, that it has an impact. Now that deals with the question
                    you were raising earlier about the Muslims and democracy and how realistic is it
                    to make the 21st Century the century of democracy, which is what the Secretary
                    of State today and the President have said is the purpose of American foreign
                    policy today. It's had its impact. I think you have greater impact if you're
                    working at the White House, but the fact of the matter is it comes together and
                    you can get groups organized and it has an impact. This is part of the strength
                    of democracy - views have an impact when you reach a political year, as we're
                    now reaching, because they get picked up?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're talking about the election year of 2004.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: That's right. The election of 2004 is coming up. It gets picked up.
                    Now I don't mean to exaggerate its influence. You'll have much greater influence
                    if you're in the government at the higher echelons of the government. I'm not
                    saying you necessarily have the influence at the lower echelons, but you do have
                    influence even at the lower echelons of government. If you're a responsible
                    citizen and you have views, I think you have a duty and an obligation to share
                    those views - if you have them. In my case the practice of law is no longer my
                    serious interest.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're talking about August 27, 2003. Just to take a
                        snapshot, how do you feel about American foreign policy and where it's going
                        today? This is very controversial. There are many people who are quite
                        unhappy. I wonder if you could just, for somebody in the future, take a look
                        and talk just a bit about that.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0163" n="Page0163"/>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: Let me say that I believe, and indeed I perhaps have had some voice in
                    contributing the thought, that I would like American foreign policy to be
                    directed toward the aim of turning the 21st century into the Century of
                    Democracy. This is my prevailing philosophy. I made a talk on the Hill before
                    the U.S. Institute of Peace during the very beginning of the Bush
                    Administration, in which I urged that democracy be America's foreign policy.
                    That's a talk that was also reprinted in Vital Speeches of the Day. So that's
                    where I come from. I do not believe that somehow those of us who were born in
                    the western hemisphere have a unique gene which permits us to enjoy democracy
                    while the rest of the human race doesn't want it, or can't experience it, or
                    wouldn't appreciate it. That's not my view of the human race, nor is it my view
                    of religion. So that I believe those of us who have, have a duty to share to
                    help. I give to charity. This is a giving idea. That's my philosophy.</p>
                <p>I did not vote for George Bush Jr., the president. I did not vote for him for
                    President, mostly because I considered myself to be a Democrat. I was not an
                    enthusiast of Al Gore, with whom I worked very closely. I didn't see Bush's job
                    as governor of Texas to be a qualification, so I didn't vote for him. But I will
                    say that I was impressed with the people around him, even during the campaign;
                    and whereas friends of mine felt that they couldn't possibly tolerate the idea
                    of Bush, I was not in that camp because I knew that Condoleezza Rice was
                    advising him on foreign policy. I had met Condoleezza Rice when she worked for
                    the elder Bush. I had worked with her because she was a specialist on Russia. I
                    was impressed with her. When she was provost at Stanford I spent time with her
                    because George Shultz set up a group of advisers; she was one of them and I was
                    one of them. We met once a year. I knew George Shultz supported Bush and George
                    Shultz told me I should not underestimate him. I had the occasion at George
                    Shultz's eightieth birthday party in San Francisco, which was a two-fold affair
                    - a big affair Saturday night which his wife ran, and a good private brunch
                    Sunday morning. But that Saturday night in San Francisco I found myself assigned
                    by Shultz to a table sitting next to Condi Rice on one side and Don Rumsfeld on
                    the other side. I knew Don Rumsfeld from his earlier experience in Washington. I
                    had invited Don Rumsfeld, when he left government, to join the board of Freedom
                    House. He joined the board of Freedom House and indeed contributed money to the
                    Freedom House. The three of us decided, in effect, to ignore the music; we'll
                    talk international policy. This was after the election, but before we knew who
                    was President. Condi knew that if Bush was President she would go down as the
                    national security adviser, and we even talked about where she should live.
                    Rumsfeld, I am certain, had no idea - had no desire to get into the government,
                    but he ended up being in the government. Well, I had known him, so I felt
                    comfortable with him; I felt comfortable with Condi Rice. I had worked closely
                    with Colin Powell when he was at the White House and when he was Joint Chiefs.
                    So I felt very good about the team that Bush brought in, and then when Bush
                    began to verbalize this business of democracy I was pleased, and remain pleased
                    at that objective.</p>
                <pb facs="0164" n="Page0164"/>
                <p>In general, therefore I will say I support the President's policies. I can not
                    say 100 percent because I don't even agree 100 percent with my wife on all
                    things, but in the main thrust I'm a supporter. Now, I do think two serious
                    mistakes were made in connection with Iraq. I've written a piece on this for the
                    Washington Post, which they published. I do not believe that a president who
                    assumes the oath of office, and who believes that national safety and security
                    call for a specific policy - policy X - I do not believe that a President who
                    took the oath of office should say I believe in policy X, but, of course, if I'm
                    vetoed at the U.N. Security Council, I won't pursue it. That is not his oath of
                    office. And as I look at the United Nations, I see Libya in charge of its human
                    rights, I see Syria replacing the United States in the human rights conference,
                    I see Libya as chairman of the security council, I see a General Assembly which
                    is controlled by non-democratic societies and states. I don't believe they are
                    equipped to substitute for the President of the United States, elected by the
                    American people, on foreign policy issues.</p>
                <p>Now, two mistakes I think that the Bush Administration made is first - and you
                    have to say the administration's error; you can blame it on Defense, you can
                    blame it on State - whatever it is, it's the administration. They were
                    unprepared for the looting that would take place and did not send in military
                    police. We should have had thousands of military police trained to police the
                    streets, so when Saddam Hussein, who has obviously demonstrated over the years
                    canniness and intelligence and tactical control, opens up all the jails, sends
                    out thousands of criminals into the streets, we should be prepared. So what do
                    the criminals do? They loot. We're not prepared to stop it. So that had a bad
                    effect on many people within Iraq. The second mistake I think we made - and this
                    shocked the hell out of me because I was certain they would understand this
                    beforehand - with our high technology and communication we should have had radio
                    outlets, and indeed radios and television outlets, throughout Iraq. On the first
                    day the President should have spoken not to the American people, but to the
                    people of Iraq and said, “Our troops are now within Iraq. We'll get out as soon
                    as we can. This is our purpose.” A number of friends of mine have now been in
                    Iraq for the last few months. One of them worked with me in Madrid and in Geneva
                    and is now on the staff of the U.S. Institute of Peace. He came back last week
                    and came to my office to brief me. He says the people of Iraq are overwhelmingly
                    for the United States; I don't get that from our press, but the Terrorists
                    gained by their radio broadcasts and we lost.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well this, I think, is always a major problem, in that the
                        press focuses on the hole and not on the doughnut. They almost have to have
                        a mob to have a picture. You get no feel for the progress that's going on
                        there.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0165" n="Page0165"/>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: Now, for example, I was listening last night to the Jim Lehrer show -
                    I try to listen to it; it's a good show. The lady who was broadcasting the news
                    said two more U.S. soldiers were killed today, bringing the total to 140 since
                    May when President Bush announced that we had won the war. Now, let me say the
                    last part of this is editorializing, just as editorializing would be “One
                    hundred and forty troops were killed, which is compared to 600 who were killed
                    in automobile accidents in the same period.” Either one is a kind of news
                    editorializing. So that is part of the problem. But you asked for my view. My
                    view is that we're going in the right direction. We've made some mistakes. I
                    don't think we're doing the right thing yet in Afghanistan. I do not think we
                    should have made deals with the feudal tribal leaders, which is what we have
                    done. I think we need more troops in Iraq; I think we need more troops in
                    Afghanistan. This is my view.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think the problem probably rests with the Pentagon right
                        now.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Moving on to another subject, you mentioned that you had been involved with
                    Israel and the Hebrew university and all, but avoided the politics. How does one
                    avoid the politics, and what are the politics of being a prominent Jewish leader
                    in Washington and you've got Israel which is a political minefield?</p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: I can only give you my view. I have always acted on the assumption
                    that I would help the democratically elected government in Israel, whatever the
                    party. If the Prime Minister needs my help, I'll help him. The Likud prime
                    minister, if he needs my help and he was elected, I'll help him. That's been my
                    approach toward this. Nor have I ever tried to mix internally in their
                    elections. I've kept away from that as far as I could. My philosophy has always
                    been that, they're a democracy, and there but for the grace of G-d go I, which
                    is exactly my philosophy as I think about, for example, the Holocaust. There but
                    for the grace of G-d go I. I think this permeates the view of many Jews. I am
                    convinced in my own head that if Israel were not a democracy I would not be with
                    that view. But the fact they are a democracy makes me of that view.</p>
                <p>Now I know Palestinians. As a matter of fact, I met with the Palestinian
                    negotiating group a number of years ago, during the Carter Administration, on
                    two occasions. On one occasion a friend of mine who is a Palestinian here and
                    works at the World Bank asked me if I would meet with their negotiating group. I
                    said of course. I met with them at one of the hotels downtown. We talked about
                    how one negotiates; we also talked about their objectives and my perception of
                    Israel's position, which has not changed. They're lovely, educated people. I
                    appreciated being with them, and on another occasion I was asked by the United
                    States to go to Athens - actually we didn't meet in Athens, it was outside of
                    Athens - where I met some Israelis and some Palestinians who were there,
                    military people, and we talked about these issues. But, regrettably, it's a mess
                    out there. Now, there are many other Jews in the United States who take part in
                    their politics, who contribute to their political campaigns for one party or the
                    other party.</p>
                <pb facs="0166" n="Page0166"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is it difficult to duck the political side of the thing?
                        You know, you have a very strong, what one could only call an Israeli lobby,
                        in the United States, which has tremendous political clout.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: It does, and I want to say that I contribute every year to that group.
                    It's AIPAC, American-Israel Public Affairs Committee. They don't mix in Israeli
                    politics. What they do is try to advance the interests of Israel as a country,
                    no matter who the leader is. They'll push resolutions, they try to get money in
                    appropriations for aid, but they don't get involved in Israeli politics.</p>
                <p>Let me say one other thing. You talk about extra-curricular work. I have not
                    discussed this. I have known every Israeli ambassador since I came to Washington
                    in 1949. That includes their early ambassador, Aubrey (Abba) Eban. A good friend
                    of mine was Israel's ambassador, Abraham Harmon, had got me involved with the
                    Hebrew University. My recollection is that their next ambassador was a man by
                    the name of Dinitz. Dinitz was very close to Henry Kissinger and during that
                    administration the oil problem came up with Saudi Arabia. He discussed it with
                    me, and I said to him, “You know, you're not equipped to deal with this
                    technical stuff, but there are people in Washington who know oil. Let me bring
                    them together for you.” So I did and they all were great - technically
                    helpful.</p>
                <p>That began a process which exists today. The composition of the people helping
                    him depends on the issue. At first, oil became the problem. Every single one of
                    those ambassadors has agreed - because they pass it one from one ambassador to
                    the next - to meet with expert Americans. The group changes. These are
                    experienced Washington people. They are all Jewish and friends of Israel. We
                    give advice when it's asked for. Mostly I think it's intelligent, responsible
                    advice. We do it with the current ambassador. We don't ever advertise it. None
                    of it is self-dealing. Every one of these people has no personal financial
                    interest with any of these issues. My wife and I had dinner last night with one
                    of the former ambassadors and his wife, who were visiting here. They just got a
                    new grandson in New York and they were visiting Washington. He's at the
                    university. We talked about the danger to Jewish and Arab civilians arising out
                    of the combat.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course this has been the name of the game for years on
                        both sides.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: I know.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The innocents far outnumber what you would call combat
                        related deaths.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0167" n="Page0167"/>
                <p>KAMPELMAN: That's right. But his answer to me was he agrees. Bt he said to me,
                    “You know what? What the Palestinians have learned is that they get surrounded
                    by people; they invite children to come around them.” This is what he said to
                    me. I don't know if that's so or not. But it's part of the game. That is said.
                    It should end. Wars should end!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's part of the game on both sides, yes.</hi>
