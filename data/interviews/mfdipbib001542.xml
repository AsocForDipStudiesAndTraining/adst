                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When and under what circumstances did you join the Voice
                        of America?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DeLONG: I was a technician at a radio station in Hollywood when the war started.
                    A friend of mine named Eddie Ruggles received a telephone call from the chief
                    engineer of the Voice at that time, Carol Hauser, an early chief engineer of a
                    radio station in Hollywood, asking him if he'd be interested in joining the
                    Voice. He decided to go, and I said to him, “Well, if when you get back there it
                    looks like anything worthwhile, let me know if they need somebody else. I might
                    be interested.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When was this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DeLONG: This was probably February of 1942.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So the Voice was just about on the air.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DeLONG: They were just getting organized. He went back, and a few days later I
                    got a big stack of papers to fill out — Form 57, security clearance
                    requirements, and a whole bunch of stuff, which I sent in. A few days later I
                    got a call — it was on a Thursday — from Hauser, who asked, could I be in New
                    York a week from Sunday.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's calling it fast.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>DeLONG: That's calling it fast. We didn't have any freeways in those days. I
                    said, “Well, I can try.” I had a house in California, and had to make
                    arrangements for somebody to rent it, and we took off in a '37 DeSoto for New
                    York. I got into New York just as I said I would, on the evening before I was
                    due to go to work. I didn't have any idea where I was going to stay, and Eddie
                    Ruggles put me up in his apartment overnight. I went into New York the following
                    morning — 270 Madison Avenue, fifth floor. That's where the studios were at that
                    time — if you can call them studios. They had some makeshift studios, two small
                    ones and one you might call a medium one. And that was it: three studios.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was using them at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DeLONG: They were used by the program staff that was headed by John Houseman. He
                    had an assistant named Mary Wilder, as I recall. In any case, there was a small
                    master control, and a recording system with three disk recorders.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So this had not been used by a previous broadcast</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DeLONG: No. No, it was all put in by Hauser and a few people that he'd managed to
                    put together, probably right after Pearl Harbor, December of '41. It was March
                    15th, '42, that I joined the Voice.</p>
                <p>A lot of the programming at that time was done by the networks, CBS and NBC
                    basically. All of the transmitters were transmitters they'd acquired from the
                    networks — NBC, CBS, Westinghouse, Crosley, GE, WRUL Worldwide — and they leased
                    some stuff from Press Wireless shortly after that — a communications outfit
                    basically for telegraph transmission.</p>
                <p>Anyway, they sat me down in this one studio, called Studio D, as I recall, and
                    they'd have 15 minutes of English, 15 minutes of German, 15 minutes of French
                    and 15 minutes of Italian, and then they'd repeat it — hour after hour after
                    hour. So that's how I got started at the Voice.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the government go about taking over — if that's
                        what they did — these transmitting facilities of the private companies?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DeLONG: I wasn't in on the negotiations, but I believe what they did was lease
                    them from the various owners. They didn't actually commandeer them, so to speak,
                    but they leased them. And of course these stations were not really financially
                    supportive because of the fact that they were shortwave. You don't do much
                    advertising on short wave.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did they have these operations just for the prestige of
                        it, to have a presence in the world?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DeLONG: Essentially, yes. Partly I think they did it because they didn't know
                    what future value these stations might have. And, at least to South America, I
                    think the networks did a little commercial work on those stations. But for the
                    most part they were money losers as far as the networks were concerned.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Presumably they were just as relieved to have the
                        government start paying them.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DeLONG: Oh, sure. Sure.</p>
                <p>We had a very small master control. Our staff at that time was a total of maybe
                    eight or nine technicians in that studio operation. As a matter of fact, when I
                    first saw it, I was a little regretful that I had taken the job; I was about
                    ready to turn around and go back. It didn't look like it was going to go any
                    place. But it did.</p>
                <p>When I first came to the Voice, one of the first people I met was Minnie Fleck,
                    who was the administrative officer for the Facilities branch at 270 Madison
                    Avenue. Minnie went on to a variety of different jobs in the Voice. And then
                    there was a fellow by the name of Doc Andrews, who was an early George Jacobs;
                    he scheduled frequencies and antennas and things like that for the Facilities
                    branch. I don't remember him ever moving up to the Argonaut Building on 57th
                    Street, but he was one of the first persons I met. Another person who was with
                    the Voice in those early days at 270 Madison Avenue is Marian Edwards, who later
                    married one of the studio technicians, Tom Kelly, and was known in later years
                    as Marian Kelly, in the Traffic office.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At what point do you recall other languages being added,
                        beyond the four initial ones? Very soon, I gather.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DeLONG: It was very soon. As a matter of fact, we didn't stay at 270 Madison
                    Avenue very long. Some time during the summer VOA took over the top floor of the
                    Argonaut Building at 57th and Broadway in New York, and they had five studios on
                    that top floor. The programs would be sent from there via telephone lines down
                    to 270 Madison Avenue through that master control until we got something going
                    on the fifth floor of the Argonaut Building. Hauser, who was in charge of the
                    technical operations insofar as the studio plants were concerned, hired some CBS
                    engineers to design and install the studio facilities in the Argonaut Building:
                    a large master control, which consisted of, as I recall, about 26 outgoing
                    channels to the transmitters; a recording system of 14 recording channels — disk
                    recording; that's before tape was ever heard of for broadcast purposes — and we
                    had 13 studios on the fifth floor, plus the five we had on the top floor. The
                    program people had the fourth floor, and in the same building there were
                    wirephoto facilities for transmitting still pictures overseas.</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>In the middle of this installation VOA started to build facilities on the West
                    Coast, in San Francisco, and Hauser went to California to get that project
                    going. He left a fellow by the name of George Herrick in charge of the technical
                    operation in New York. George was a very ambitious fellow. He kind of took over
                    when Hauser went to California, and by the time Hauser had finished in
                    California and got back to New York he effectively didn't have a job left.
                    Herrick had taken over the operation. Hauser soon resigned and returned to
                    California. He later opened a broadcast station in Eureka, California.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who did Hauser or Herrick report to? DeLONG: Hauser
                        reported to James Weldon, who was the chief engineer for the OWI. You know,
                        this started out to be what was called the Coordinator of Information.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Right. VOA in COI preceded the OWI.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DeLONG: The COI was part of the Emergency Management thing of the President. And
                    of course Robert Sherwood, as you know, was head of the operation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He took over the Overseas Branch of the OWI.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DeLONG: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I've understood that the program operation on the West
                        Coast was practically independent of New York. Was the engineering also, or
                        was there any attempt to coordinate them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DeLONG: There was an attempt to coordinate it. However, it did operate
                    essentially independently of New York. Hauser went out to San Francisco to get
                    it established, but once it was established it was on its own, more or less. Of
                    course, the Voice still didn't have any transmitters of its own; they were still
                    operating under lease. In California they had Associated Broadcasters and
                    General Electric Company transmitters.</p>
                <p>Anyway, Herrick had taken over. And as I started to say, in the middle of the
                    installation of the studio plant in the Argonaut Building, Herrick came to me
                    one day and said, “Do you think we can finish up this job, because I'm not
                    satisfied with the way CBS is doing this.” It wasn't CBS per se, it was a group
                    of engineers who worked for CBS who were doing the work. CBS itself had no
                    direct relationship; these fellows were on their own.</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>Anyway, he came to me and said, “Do you think we can finish up this job on our
                    own?” I was young and foolish and said, “Of course we can.” So he turned the
                    whole thing over to me to finish up the studio plant. We had an electrical
                    contractor who had been working with the CBS group and we kept them on. All I
                    did was supervise the thing. Max Swoboda assisted. We doubled the capacity of
                    master control; it started out as 20 and we doubled it to 40. They were adding
                    more and more programs. I couldn't keep up with the programming. All we did was
                    get the facilities ready. Of course, everything recorded in those days was done
                    by disk.</p>
                <p>We had a training program for technicians because there weren't any available. We
                    robbed some of the broadcast stations. We had some fellows from WOR in New York
                    and from WINS in New York — that's where Herrick came from, by the way. Max
                    Swoboda was also from WINS. We had Ed Scatterday and Joe Craig from WOR. They
                    were in Master Control. Chuck Phillips headed up Recording. He was from
                    California.</p>
                <p>That's how it all got started. It was in the Argonaut Building that you might say
                    the Voice hit its stride. It was a well-established operation by now. We stayed
                    in that building all through the war.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you stay in that part of the engineering
                        operation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DeLONG: I stayed in that part until the construction job was finished, and then I
                    was put in charge of the plant operation, that is, the technicians who operated
                    the equipment. We had a supervisor for studio facilities; we had a supervisor
                    for recording; we had a master control supervisor, each with their individual
                    staffs. And then I had the job on top of that. I reported to Herrick and Herrick
                    reported to the head of the Facilities branch, Pete Nelson. There were fellows
                    like Gene Patterson, who was in charge of scheduling studios. John Dowd was in
                    charge of scheduling transmitters. Ed Burgeni worked in Dowd's group. Herrick
                    was chief of the technical operation. We continued right there throughout the
                    war.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And your relationship with the various language
                        operations, I suppose, was like that that I experienced in VOA in
                        Washington, in which all kinds of language services use the same
                        studio.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DeLONG: That's right. It was the same kind of scheduling problem. Everybody
                    wanted to do the same thing at the same time. Nobody wanted to work at night. We
                    had a traffic operation. Such fellows as Perry Harten and Gene Patterson and
                    Dowd were in that kind of an operation. Howard Hotchner at that time was in
                    charge, I believe, of the production operation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think that was after the war that he became head of

                <p>DeLONG: It seemed to me he was there during the war. I'm pretty sure he was there
                    during the war. I remember we had a Broadcast Steering Committee for a short
                    time. Gene Patterson, Howard Hotchner and I met every couple of weeks to try and
                    work out differences that might come up. We wrote several papers for
                    distribution to the staffs to help explain how certain operations were carried
                    out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Werner Michel was in charge of production in the early
                        days.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DeLONG: I remember that name, too.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At least that's what Gene Kern told me. There was a
                        triumvirate heading the program operation — Houseman, Werner Michel and
                        Connie Ernst, according to Gene.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DeLONG: They were all a little bit out of my area, so I don't know specifically
                    where each one of them fit.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, when you built this installation in the Argonaut
                        Building and doubled the size of master control and increased the number of
                        studios, was there any expectation that this was going to continue after the
                        war?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DeLONG: No. As a matter of fact, I figured that when the thing was all over I
                    would be going back to California. Of course, when the war ended, the State
                    Department took it over, until Dulles became Secretary.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did VOA engineering have any liaison relationship with the
                        military? I know it did with the BBC.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DeLONG: One studio at least was devoted to AFRS (Armed Forces Radio Service).
                    They used to program part of the day on some of the transmitters for AFRS
                    through our master control and using our studios.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Gene Kern says that VOA did a number of programs for the
                        troops — jazz programs, pop music programs.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DeLONG: If they did I didn't know about it. If it came from VOA itself and they
                    did that kind of programming, well then they did it and I didn't know about it.
                    But I do know that AFRS did their own programming with their own people through
                    our facilities in the Argonaut Building.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think it was in Houseman's book, but somewhere I have
                        read that the first programs that went on the air from VOA were shipped, on
                        disk, by bomber across the Atlantic and then played from transmitters of the
                        BBC in London. Do you have any recollection of that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DeLONG: I know we shipped records, that's all I know. I think he probably is
                    right. He would know.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But I can't imagine doing a news program and then shipping
                        it across the ocean.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DeLONG: It probably wouldn't be a news program. I don't know. It could be
                    something that was current but not necessarily news.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I know there was an organization of broadcast operators in
                        London for the United States called the American Broadcasting Station in
                        Europe — ABSIE. Was there any connection between you people and the ABSIE
                        operation? I guess the technical side of ABSIE was run by the BBC, wasn't
                        it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DeLONG: That's right. Yes, there was some coordination because I remember the
                    name being mentioned in New York when we were there. Herrick never was very
                    communicative with respect to details, so I didn't personally handle anything
                    like that. I know there were conversations back and forth, but the degree to
                    which VOA controlled ABSIE, if any, I don't know.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you aware, during the war, toward the latter days of
                        the war, that a committee of top broadcasters in this country, including
                        Sarnoff and Lemmon and a number of other big, top names in the industry,
                        proposed the setting up of a foundation for broadcasting by short wave
                        overseas for the United States government? And presumably they would turn
                        over their facilities to the foundation. Nothing ever came of it, as far as
                        I know.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DeLONG: I never heard of it. The State Department took over after the war. There
                    was a short time after the war in which there was some kind of intermediate
                    operation, but I don't know under what jurisdiction it fell.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was called something like the Interim International
                        Information Administration; I don't remember the name of it.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>DeLONG: For a very short time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then of course in '47 most of the programming went to CBS
                        and NBC. So at that time what happened to you people in engineering? Because
                        they cut a lot of the broadcasting. Did they RIF you people, too?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DeLONG: As I recall, there wasn't too much in the way of layoffs. When the war
                    ended, I think a number of the studio technicians were reduced. The rest of the
                    operation wasn't, because even though some of the programming went to the
                    networks, the programs were fed through our master control to the transmitters.
                    We still did a lot of recording, all the time. So there was no substantial
                    reduction in staffing when some of the programming was taken over, principally
                    by CBS. We did set up a small facility at CBS for doing this stuff, which I'm
                    sure VOA paid for. And undoubtedly they paid for whatever programming the
                    networks did for them.</p>
                <p>But that didn't last very long, Cliff. It was a very short period. And the stuff
                    all came back again. We had to build studios finally after the war, about five
                    studios, over in the Fisk Building, which was across the street from the
                    Argonaut. They needed more space in the Argonaut, so they moved the engineering
                    group into the Excelsior Bank Building, which was across 57th Street; we were on
                    the second floor. It was in that building where we really started the expansion
                    of the transmitter facilities for the Voice.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was my next question. When the war actually ended,
                        did the broadcasters who had leased these facilities to VOA during the war
                        ask for them back, or take them back? What did you start using instead of
                        them if you didn't have those facilities any more?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DeLONG: No, they continued to use them until we constructed facilities. What
                    financial arrangements were made? I don't know. But we continued to use them;
                    the stations continued to operate. We didn't have our own staffs in those
                    places. CBS and NBC operated the two transmitter plants in California, Dixon and
                    Delano. Associated Broadcasters and GE transmitters in California disappeared.
                    You see, Jim Weldon, who was chief engineer for OWI, did start some construction
                    work. As a matter of fact, I think he was responsible for construction of the
                    two plants in California that were operated by CBS and NBC — Dixon and Delano.
                    They replaced the San Francisco facilities.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These were new facilities?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DeLONG: These were new facilities that he installed.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And was this during or after the war?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DeLONG: It was probably done during the last half of the war, probably about
                    1944.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At some point, we also had an installation in Honolulu, or
                        somewhere in Hawaii.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DeLONG: That's true.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was that during the war?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DeLONG: I don't believe so. I think that came up after the war.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So Dixon and Delano replaced the Associated and GE
                        facilities.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DeLONG: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about Schenectady and Bound Brook (NJ) and Scituate
                        (MA)?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DeLONG: Schenectady disappeared. We continued to operate Bound Brook. We
                    continued at Brentwood, Long Island — that was under CBS. Scituate operated for
                    a long time. Walter Lemmon and the Voice were at odds because Lemmon wanted, I
                    believe, to take the facility back but the government didn't want to give it up.
                    It was a very poor installation, by the way; it was always a source of trouble.
                    We sent inspection teams out to look at it, and they kept reporting deficiencies
                    in the equipment. They had a lot of equipment failures. Eventually the
                    government gave it up after the war.</p>
                <p>But when the Voice started to build its own plants, principally overseas, of
                    course — when we invaded Germany and got as far as Munich, Herrick went over and
                    took over the Munich Relay Station, which was a German installation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: With Czech equipment.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DeLONG: With Czech equipment, that's right. And we added a medium wave
                    transmitter there. While we were still in the Argonaut Building we started what
                    we called the Ring Plan, which was Jade, John — in Okinawa and the Philippines,
                    two major plants on the East and West Coasts of the United States, Tangier — all
                    of that was going on after the war.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's when the Cold War had started, and the “Ring” was
                        to ring the Soviet Union.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DeLONG: That's right. That's right. And the Vagabond. You've heard of the
                    Vagabond, the transmitter on a ship.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which turned out to be the Courier.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DeLONG: The Courier, that's right. And we even had what I called the Great White
                    Whale, which was a mobile unit on wheels, with recording equipment in it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is that the thing that's down at Greenville still, in two
                        parts? It's a massive thing, totally impractical.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DeLONG: No, I don't think so. This was one unit, and was operated by a fellow by
                    the name of Lou Ross, who was a government employee. He was our mobile
                    operator.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was an operator, all right.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DeLONG: You can say that again.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So what happened to the Ring Plan?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DeLONG: The Ring Plan was going full steam. We'd broken ground in the state of
                    Washington, and we had acquired sites and started to do some clearing work in
                    North Carolina. The contracts had been let for all the transmitters. The
                    Philippines and Okinawa got started, and we had contracts for the construction
                    when Joe McCarthy hit the fan, and everything stopped cold, except the ones
                    which we actually had construction contracts for. The two sites in the state of
                    Washington and in North Carolina were stopped and the land sold off.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We wound up with practically the same installation in
                        North Carolina eventually anyhow.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DeLONG: That's right. That wasn't till quite some time later.</p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>You asked earlier about cooperation between VOA engineering and the military.
                    When they went to invade Italy, they wanted to set up an operation in Rome,
                    which required a small master control. There was a lieutenant named Vic Terola,
                    who approached us about designing — or helping them design — a small m.c. for
                    the Rome operation. It was a very rudimentary thing, and I had the job of
                    putting that thing together. We contracted with the Langevin Company to build
                    it, essentially copied after an old Western Electric design. It was rudimentary
                    but it did the job. In that sense, I personally did some cooperation with the
                    military. Vic is still alive but he's in a nursing home down in Florida.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this to broadcast to the Italian population?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DeLONG: Yes, it was a local broadcast operation by the military. In Germany they
                    had military government. I presume they had something similar to that in
                    Italy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But in Italy, as I recall, they assumed that they were
                        reverting to democracy right off the bat.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DeLONG: That's right. But they needed something over there. Maybe the existing
                    facilities had been so damaged that they had to set something up for them. I
                    don't know. Of course, we had a liaison man in London with the BBC, Bill Brady.
                    He was there for years and years.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Back to the subject of the new construction after the war.
                        You said that Scituate kept operating for a while, that Schenectady was
                        turned back to GE, you kept Bound Brook going for a while, and Brentwood,
                        Long Island</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DeLONG: There was another one called Wayne, New Jersey. And Crosley in Cincinnati
                    — Bethany, we call it. It's still operating, as far as I know.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You talked about the construction on the West Coast, at
                        Dixon and Delano, but what construction was there on the East Coast?</hi>

                <p>DeLONG: We had these six 500-kilowatt transmitters in the warehouse in Brooklyn,
                    because when the Ring Plan was cancelled as a result of the McCarthy thing — or
                    part of it, we got some of it built, the Asian part, but not the stateside
                    transmitters — we had the transmitters because we'd already bought them in
                    preparation for the installation. And they were delivered and put in Brooklyn in
                    storage, from approximately 1948.</p>
                <p>When jamming started, George Herrick came up with the idea of using a “clipper”
                    on the VOA transmitters. The clipper is a device which chops off the highest
                    peaks in the sound as it's being transmitted through the transmitters, and
                    effectively raises the average volume or loudness of the transmission. In
                    addition to that, it provided for pre-emphasis, on the theory that the sibilant
                    sounds add more to the intelligibility of the received signal than just an
                    ordinary flat characteristic. So we pre-emphasized the higher tones in speech,
                    and the “s's” and such sounds as that. Julie Ross did the development work on
                    the clipper, and I had to write an instruction book for the overseas
                    transmitters. These devices were used on the transmissions and effectively
                    increased the loudness of VOA signals all during the jamming period, and we
                    continued to use them right up until around 1977 or thereabouts.</p>
                <p>They were controversial because the clipper causes distortion in the signal,
                    known as harmonic distortion, and while it increases the intelligibility, it
                    also makes the sound a little less desirable to listen to. There's no question
                    that it did increase the loudness of VOA signals, but one of the things which
                    developed later was when you used clippers on top of clippers — that is, we used
                    the clipper on this stateside transmitter and then it was clipped again on the
                    transmitters overseas. If it's relayed more than once or twice the distortion
                    becomes rather evident. And the pre-emphasis also causes what you might term
                    distortion of the signal.</p>
                <p>In about 1976 or thereabouts a big question arose as to whether we should
                    continue to use clippers, and it was one of the things that Ed Martin and Ken
                    Giddens had a difference of opinion on. Subsequently, the clippers were removed
                    and a new version of a limiting-type amplifier, which was developed by John
                    Birch, was used on the VOA transmissions.</p>
                <p>But back to the story. In 1949 I was sent to Mexico City as part of the
                    delegation to an international conference on broadcasting. The delegation was
                    chaired by George Sterling of the Federal Communications Commission. The people
                    from the Voice down there were Roger Legge, Muse Delgado, and me. The FCC had
                    three or four people down there. And there was one representative from RCA. The
                    purpose of the Mexico City conference, which was related to the ITU — the
                    International Telecommunication Union — was to establish a broadcasting plan for
                    sharing the high-frequency short wave broadcast channels, worldwide. The
                    Russians, the French, the British, the Netherlands were there — everybody was
                    there. I went down in January and came back in March; I was there about three
                    months. The conference came up with a plan for certain sunspots, sunspot 70
                    summer time. I don't want to get too technical but sunspots affect short wave
                    broadcasting — what frequency to use, night and day, at certain hours in order
                    to reach a specific target.</p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And they go in 11-year cycles, is it? DeLONG: The sunspots
                        go in approximately an 11-year cycle. So this was a median sunspot number,
                        sunspot 70. Trying to put all the requirements of all these countries into a
                        plan was something like trying to put a gallon of milk in a quart bottle. It
                        just wouldn't work, without taking a lot away from countries in the way of
                        facilities and frequencies to use. The Russians and the United States did
                        not accept the proposals. As a matter of fact, I personally sent a note to
                        George Sterling just before I came back to New York, saying the plan could
                        never work. I opposed any signing of the plan by the United States. George
                        Sterling and the FCC group were trying very hard to get a plan; they wanted
                        to accept the plan. Roger Legge, I believe, was inclined to go along with
                        them, but Delgado and I didn't like the idea at all.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Delgado was then the program manager.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DeLONG: That's right. Anyway, the United States and the Russians did not accept
                    the Mexico City plan, but a number of other countries did sign it. The way the
                    thing works in practice is that the guy with the most power in transmitter
                    kilowatts is the guy who gets what he wants. You just force your way in. That's
                    the brute force system that we use now.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mean we're still not signatories?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DeLONG: We're signatories to the ITU, but not to the plan. And the way the system
                    works is that the various countries register the frequencies that they're using
                    with the ITU, so everybody knows what everybody else is using, and they try to
                    fit their stuff in as best they can and if they can't, well, they just go on
                    with them. Tough luck. And the guy with the most power wins, you might say. But
                    it works something like that.</p>
                <p>Anyway, the conference set up a committee to meet in Paris the following June,
                    June of '49, and I was selected, along with Prose Walker of the FCC, to go to
                    Paris representing the United States as observers. The Russians also had
                    observers there. And the rest of the people — the Canadians, the British, the
                    French, and so forth — were charged with the responsibility of establishing
                    plans for other sunspot numbers in other seasons.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course, at that point, the Germans and the Japanese
                        were not figuring into these international agreements — big broadcasters
                        today.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>DeLONG: That's right. So, they worked there six months. The funny part of it is,
                    all the technical information that was available was furnished by the United
                    States, because the FCC had developed a set of charts, transparencies that you
                    could slide back and forth for certain paths, certain frequencies, stuff like
                    that, so it was quite easy to determine what the best frequency would be at any
                    time under any set of conditions. This information was made available to the
                    plan committee, but we didn't participate in the plan except to be there and
                    report home.</p>
                <p>Well, Prose Walker's mother died just a few weeks before the end of the committee
                    so he had to come back to the United States and left me over there by myself. My
                    contact back in the State Department was a fellow by the name of Fred Trimmer,
                    who at one time was sort of associated with the Voice — I don't know in what
                    capacity, some kind of liaison type thing. The night before the closing of the
                    committee I sent off a message from the embassy in Paris back to Trimmer and
                    told him that the conference was closing and asked if there was anything I
                    should say at the closing meeting. I never got an answer — I mean, I got an
                    answer but it didn't get there in time. It said just observe the reactions of
                    the various countries to the proposed plan. It wasn't very hard to do.</p>
                <p>But the following day I felt kind of like a bump on a log sitting there in the
                    conference not knowing whether I should say something or not. I finally decided
                    I would make some kind of innocuous statement, so after they had done all of the
                    voting on it and were just about ready to close up, I raised my hand and asked
                    for recognition — the chairman was a Frenchman, host country. I made a short
                    speech, something to the effect that I had observed their work over the past six
                    months and recognized the fact that they had all worked very hard and diligently
                    to come up with a plan but in my judgment the plan could never work because they
                    could not possibly accommodate the requirements of all the countries in the
                    plan. I felt sure that the United States could not accept their work, but the
                    official position of the United States would be known at a later date — words to
                    that effect. I thanked them for their hospitality, et cetera, and that was my
                    contribution to the Technical Planning Committee. I've got a certificate from
                    the Department of State: Delegate to the Technical Planning Committee. So that
                    was that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your job at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>DeLONG: They had pulled me out of the operating job that I had in New York, when
                    I was plant manager — plant supervisor, I guess you might call it. I don't
                    remember what my civil service thing says. That was effectively what the job
                    was. When I came back from Mexico City I went back in that job for three months,
                    but when I went to Paris they assigned a fellow by the name of El Morde, who had
                    been a master control man, to the plant job. He was down in Washington, too, for
                    a short time till he died. When I got back from Paris, George Herrick said to
                    me, “Look, I don't want you to go back in operations.” He had plans for a
                    magnificent plant in New York — 36 studios, a master control with 50 outgoing
                    channels, a large recording operation. By this time we had started to use tape.
                    We had one of the first tape machines, the Ampex 200, in New York — two of them
                    as I recall.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was before there was any idea of moving to
                        Washington.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DeLONG: Before any idea of moving to Washington. We were going to have these 36
                    studios — one auditorium-type and one large one — and a big recording operation
                    — 40 recording channels. We were still dedicated to disk at that time; tape
                    equipment in our judgment hadn't proven itself yet, although that 200 was a nice
                    machine, the first one that Ampex made, and it ran at 30 inches per second.
                    Later we started using 7 1/2 inches.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When I joined the Voice in Washington, in the Interior
                        Department penthouse, they were using Magnecorders, and tape exclusively. We
                        didn't have any disk machines up there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DeLONG: When was that?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: 1951.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DeLONG: That's when we were in the transition stage. Incidentally, I had to go
                    down to Washington with Charlie Affelder once. The two of us rehabbed that
                    equipment down there.</p>
                <p>Anyway, when I came back from Paris, George says, “I don't want you to go back to
                    operations. I want you to take on the job of the design of these facilities” —
                    this magnificent dream he had about 36 studios. Where he got the need for it
                    I'll never know, but he apparently sold it to the director through the
                    facilities manager at that time, a fellow by the name of Nelson. They had no
                    idea of ever going to Washington.</p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>So, okay, I take on the job. We contract with Smith Meeker Engineering Company of
                    New York. I spent about nine months on the design. We got a complete set of
                    specifications for the equipment — blueprints, drawings, what have you, for the
                    whole ball of wax, equipment-wise. In the meantime, the administrative people
                    were looking for a building in New York in which to put these facilities. They
                    never found one. Or before they found one the Congress decided that the Voice
                    should be in Washington and not in New York. Of course, in the meantime my plans
                    had gone on the shelf because there wasn't any place to build it. We had all
                    these fancy plans and no place to put them. When the Congress decided we should
                    come to Washington, I was put on the study team to come to Washington to find a
                    suitable place in which to place the studios.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It had to be a government building?DeLONG: It had to be a
                        government building, and GSA was supposed to provide it. First they thought
                        maybe they could use NBC's Washington studios, because they were moving out
                        on Nebraska Avenue and they had a facility above the Trans-Lux Theater, a
                        tiny little place. I said, “No good.” Then they thought maybe they could use
                        the CBS studios which were down on 13th Street, just about the same kind of
                        set-up. “No good.” We couldn't possibly use it. It would only accommodate
                        about two or three programs at one time so we couldn't possibly use it. Then
                        they showed us the old Pension Building. It had this great big area down on
                        the main floor where the dances used to be held and then all these balconies
                        around for about four flights up.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All that waste space. There's no way you could build
                        offices in the middle there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DeLONG: No. I said, “Well, I can tell you this much. I can build studios down
                    there on that dance floor, but I don't know how people are going to get to
                    them.” (Laughter) So that was out. Then they showed us the attic of the General
                    Accounting Office building, where there was a bunch of air-conditioning
                    equipment running. I said, “Can't do it; can't use it.” They wanted us to move
                    out to Suitland, where the Census Bureau is, and I didn't even bother to go out
                    because the director of USIA at the time, Ted Streibert, said it has to be
                    inside Washington. So then we started to lay out some of the floors in 1778
                    Pennsylvania Avenue (later 1776). But when the administrative people got wind of
                    that, that was nixed because they needed it for USIA, not for the Voice.
                    Finally, after several months, GSA came up with the second floor of the HEW
                    building for the studio plant. It was the best we had seen, and we were running
                    out of time because we had a deadline to meet. So I said, “Okay, this will work.
                    We can make studios here.” So essentially I was responsible for us being in
                    HEW.</p>
                <p>We contracted with an architectural firm, Deigert and Yerkes here in Washington,
                    and they did the design of the physical layout. I had an assistant named Ken
                    Manhart who was an acoustical engineer. He helped with the acoustical layout of
                    the studios — the sound treatment. He subsequently went with Douglas Aircraft,
                    one of the their best acoustical engineers. I still hear from him
                    occasionally.</p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>We got out our plans that had been on the shelf, for the grandiose plans in New
                    York, dusted them off, cut hunks of it out, discarded part of it. We then issued
                    invitations for bids, and got about four of them, one of them being Gates Radio
                    Company in Quincy, Illinois. This was custom design. It wasn't standard
                    equipment; all the result of my work with Smith Meeker Co.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was a beautiful set-up at the time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DeLONG: Yeah. The Voice's director at that time was Jack Poppele, and he didn't
                    like Gates Radio. He wanted Western Electric Company equipment. I guess he was
                    brought up on Western Electric equipment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was chief engineer of WOR, wasn't he?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DeLONG: In name. In any case, he had a fellow working with him who had been with
                    him at WOR; I can't think of his name offhand. The contract people were going
                    crazy. Gates Radio Company was the low bidder. They agreed to meet all the
                    specifications, no questions asked, guaranteed. So all we really had to do was
                    to build the stuff according to the plans. It didn't matter whether it was Gates
                    Radio Company, Western Electric or somebody else, as long as it was properly
                    built. In the meantime we were trying to meet a deadline. Finally, over in the
                    contract office one day, this fellow I mentioned who worked with Poppele and I
                    were trying to resolve this thing, and he finally picked up the phone and called
                    Poppele and said, “Look, Jack, do you want to be responsible for not meeting the
                    Congressional deadline for the Voice to be in Washington?” He explained to him
                    that in spite of the fact it was Gates Radio Company it was still custom
                    equipment. So Poppele finally gave in and said okay. So we got a contract with
                    Gates Radio Company. I spent the next six months, at least, in Quincy, Illinois,
                    off and on, traveling back and forth, checking the design out, testing stuff,
                    making a few modifications where things didn't work quite the way we figured
                    they would. John Birch, whom you may know, was at Gates; he worked for Gates at
                    the time, and he and I worked together out there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you, in effect, hired him.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DeLONG: Yeah. As a matter of fact, I've got one of the knobs like those we used
                    on the consoles. (Laughter)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, those studios have lasted a long time.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>DeLONG: Twenty-five years, at least. So then we got into the construction. GSA
                    had the contract for the construction, not the Voice. There were accountants on
                    the floor, watching all the time. I have to say they did a pretty good job. We
                    worked right along with them. One of the problems was that the architect had
                    developed a color scheme for the studios as part of the design. The floor tile
                    for the studios and the corridor was on order and virtually in shipment to the
                    site, when Poppele found out what color they were, and didn't like it. GSA had
                    to cancel the order and reorder, and it delayed the thing at least two weeks. In
                    the meantime, we were gradually getting the stuff in from Gates Radio but not
                    fast enough to meet our deadline. So in the back corner of what we called the
                    equipment room, which is in that space between master control and central
                    recording, we took a corner back there and threw in what was called a temporary
                    master control. We had wires draped from the ceiling and all over the place. We
                    only had one studio ready to go, Studio 13 — plus Interior — and the night
                    before the first broadcast out of Washington — I remember it well — at 2 o'clock
                    in the morning, Julie Ross and I were on the floor under the console, wondering
                    where in the world is this hum coming from. (Laughter) We were scheduled to go
                    on the air at 10 o'clock the next morning. We spent at least an hour trying to
                    find where this noise was coming from — and finally located it as a misplaced
                    ground on the installation. So we fixed it, made the deadline, and the thing
                    went off without a hitch. We got on the air.</p>
                <p>In the meantime, this big master control starts to arrive, and we put it in, and
                    then had the problem of cutting over to it. I never will forget that day. When
                    we cut over to it, all at once the whole studio plant took off in oscillation.
                    The electricians were working all over the place, hooking stuff up, you know.
                    All of this was going on, and I said, “Cut it!” So we cut everything off and
                    went back to the temporary, and then tried it again. I told the electricians to
                    stop working. Whatever it was cleared, and I presumed an electrician that was
                    working some place was responsible. We tried it again and it worked.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How long did it take, from the time you started
                        construction of those studios to completion?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DeLONG: You mean actual physical construction? At least a year; probably more
                    like 15 or 16 months to get it going, because we had to work around everything.
                    We had temporary operations, and were trying to get our stuff in and get it
                    operating.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you able to start with some studios while others were
                        still under construction?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DeLONG: Oh, sure. We'd bring studios on the line as fast as we could. As soon as
                    we'd get a console we'd stick it in a studio, get it hooked up and in operation
                    until we got finished. So that was a big job for me, and I was quite proud of it
                    actually. I got an award for it, as a matter of fact.</p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>Then for a short time I headed up what was called the Audio Engineering Section
                    under Julie Ross. By this time Ed Martin was engineering manager, of course.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was Julie Ross's job?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DeLONG: Martin was engineering manager. Under him was Ross as chief engineer. He
                    had a power plant engineer under him, Bill Walker, and a radio frequency
                    engineer, Charlie Pease. In the audio engineering group I had Charlie Affelder
                    and another fellow working with me. We were basically trying to clean up the
                    data on the installation of the plant so everybody would know where everything
                    was connected — what we call running sheets, showing where wire terminals are
                    and what's connected to them, and all that kind of stuff.</p>
                <p>I was sitting in my office one day when Charlie Pease comes in to me and says,
                    “You've been elected.” I say, “Elected for what?” And he says, “You're going to
                    be project engineer for the Greenville project.” I'd heard about it. It wasn't
                    called the Greenville project at the time because we hadn't yet picked
                    Greenville as the site. The general area had been selected by Ross, but the
                    specific sites had not been picked out.</p>
                <p>The first thing I did was to go down with Ross to North Carolina, and we surveyed
                    different areas near Greenville for the plants. We picked three places. GSA
                    started condemnation proceedings for the land. I had to write up a specification
                    for the development of a design for the plant. That is, what was to go into the
                    plant, how many antennas we needed, what their bearings should be — I had to
                    work with George Jacobs on this — frequencies and bearings needed for specific
                    antennas.</p>
                <p>The Greenville project included a receiving station and two transmitting plants.
                    The receiving station was to receive from overseas and pipe the stuff up to
                    Washington. I know they used it on the two-ways and things like that. So, I had
                    to write this design spec up, and we contracted with the Austin Company, after
                    negotiating with several firms. The contracting officer, at my recommendation,
                    and I guess Ross's, picked Austin Company, designing engineers. That picture
                    over there on the wall shows me with Allen Austin and next to him, mugging the
                    camera, is Dick Wittenmeyer, who was their project engineer for the project.
                    That picture was taken in Greenville at the dedication of the plant; Ed Murrow
                    and George Allen are there in the background. I went to Cleveland, where the
                    Austin Company is, and I spent at least one winter out there. It took us about a
                    year to develop the design for the plant. It was a CPFF contract.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you in effect moved to Cleveland.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>DeLONG: I didn't move to Cleveland, but I'd go back and forth about once a week.
                    When the design was finished, Charlie Pease and a couple of other fellows — an
                    electrical engineer, a civil engineer and I — all went out to Cleveland for a
                    final review of the plant specs. We were about a week out there doing that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were the transmitters that were installed there the ones
                        that were in the Brooklyn warehouse?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DeLONG: Yes. The 500 KW transmitters that were installed — three of them went in
                    Site A, three of them went in Site B, so we had six 500-kilowatt
                    transmitters.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: To start with.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DeLONG: To start with. We also bought six General Electric 250-kilowatt
                    transmitters that were installed there. The 500's consisted essentially of two
                    250-kilowatt amplifiers linked together through a combiner.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were they used with the full 500 kilowatts of power to
                        start with?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DeLONG: Yes. To the best of my knowledge, they were.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I didn't think we had any 500's until recent years.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DeLONG: No. Greenville started off with 500's. We had some trouble keeping them
                    there because a lot of the vacuum capacitors had been in the warehouse for so
                    long — you know, they have shelf life. But they were put in as 500-kilowattt
                    transmitters, and they were operated as 500 kilowatt transmitters — at least
                    after a short shakedown they were.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ed Martin said that somebody, I forget who it was, had
                        said — maybe it was the Congress — that they didn't want a Latin American
                        capability because Lemmon was doing our work for us in Latin America, and
                        that George Allen insisted that we include a Latin American capability.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DeLONG: We put in Latin America antennas, that I know. You see, I was purely a
                    hardware type. That was all I did. In Greenville we had approximately 100
                    antennas, we had six 250-kilowatt transmitters, six 500-kilowatt transmitters,
                    and four 50-kilowatt transmitters, plus a couple of other smaller ones.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At what point was the decision made, and the Congressional
                        approval gotten, to go for Greenville? And who was responsible? After the
                        McCarthy destruction of the Ring Plan, nothing was done for years. Was it
                        Loomis or Allen or who got this thing moving again?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DeLONG: That I can't be sure of. I don't know whether Loomis was there at the
                    outset of it. The money was appropriated, of course, by Congress, but the choice
                    of Greenville was an engineering decision.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Loomis joined VOA in '58. He told me his chief concern,
                        when he took over, was to get this worldwide transmitter system back on the
                        track.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DeLONG: I guess he was in charge of the Voice at that time. '58 was just about
                    the time that thing started. I didn't keep dates.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ed Martin thinks that George Allen deserves the credit and
                        not Henry Loomis.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DeLONG: Maybe both of them. It might have been a combined thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you say it took a year to do Greenville.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DeLONG: The design took almost a year, and another year, almost, to get it
                    installed. We had a terrific problem down there with drainage, getting water off
                    the land. We had to default one contractor on that job because he didn't
                    complete on time. He got caught in the winter and couldn't finish his contract
                    on schedule. The civil engineer and I went down to Greenville to review the
                    situation, and there was mud all over the place — terrible. So we came back to
                    Washington, and Ed Noel, who was contracting officer at that time, wanted to
                    terminate the guy because he wasn't meeting the schedule. Both the civil
                    engineer and I recommended he not terminate because it would take somebody else
                    the same amount of time to get that part finished. But he did it anyway. He
                    called — it was Christmas Eve, I remember — he called Greenville on the phone
                    and terminated the contract. It took three months to get somebody else on the
                    job and to get going again.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So when you completed Greenville, what then?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>DeLONG: The next job I had was setting up two small receiving stations in
                    California, one associated with Dixon, the other associated with Delano. The
                    idea at that time — we were security conscious — was to establish a method of
                    keeping in touch with the West Coast if we lost our transcontinental telephone
                    facility — the idea being that we could relay from Greenville to the West Coast,
                    to those transmitters.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're getting to Greenville from Washington by
                        microwave.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DeLONG: That's right. That was one of the shortcomings. I was in my office one
                    day and a fellow from Philco Radio came in. He said, “How are you going to
                    deliver your stuff to Greenville?” I said, “Oh, I don't know. I suspect we'll
                    use AT&amp;T lines like we've always done, for our service to Greenville.” As a
                    matter of fact, I think Marian Kelly (in the Traffic office) had already started
                    to work on establishing the circuits. This is while the construction was going
                    on in Greenville, of course. He said, “I think we can save you some money.” I
                    said, “Well, I can't stop you from making a proposal if you want to make one.” A
                    few days later we got a proposal from Philco, with the cost. We wrote a memo
                    through Martin to Loomis, and Loomis bought the idea of using microwave.</p>
                <p>The problem developed when we got competitive. I mean, the contracting officer as
                    usual had to get bids. We couldn't negotiate with Philco without getting
                    somebody else in, so we had to write a set of specs for a microwave system. We
                    established reliability requirements — 99.5% reliability, that sort of thing,
                    and issued an invitation for people to bid. Philco bid. But because they knew
                    they were competitive, Philco trimmed their original proposal, that they had
                    made on an unsolicited basis, and left out one relay station, claiming that they
                    could maintain the service with one less microwave relay station. They were the
                    best bidder, so we awarded Philco the contract.</p>

                <p>DeLONG: Despite the trim-back. We had nobody, frankly, on our staff that had any
                    great experience with microwave stuff, but the firm was reliable, we thought.
                    The system went in and for a while it worked. Then we started having outages.
                    The contract included service. They had to have a man down there on the system
                    all the time on call, so when something happened he'd have to get to the relay
                    station that was in trouble — they had a monitoring system to tell him which one
                    it was — and get it fixed. Or try to get it fixed. But where it's a propagation
                    problem, you can't fix it with equipment — except to add more relay points
                    within the system. So we suffered along with this for quite some time. VOA set
                    up emergency back-up lines, low-quality service with the phone company. Anyway,
                    later we had a fellow come on the job who knew a little bit about microwave, and
                    after prolonged agonizing with the Philco set-up, we took the bull by the horns
                    and decided to revamp the entire system. We added some additional antennas and
                    some additional relay points — one at least — and I think the thing's been
                    fairly reliable since then. It wasn't too long after that that I retired.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned a satellite a minute ago. The satellite
                        wasn't in the beginning of Greenville, was it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DeLONG: No. That was an add-on. As a matter of fact, it was done after I left the
                    Voice.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did you retire?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DeLONG: 1979. January.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So what happened between the refurbishing or redesign of
                        the microwave and your retirement?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DeLONG: Well, of course I was out of Greenville once that plant went into
                    operation, except if they had a problem down there and they wanted some
                    information I could provide it, maybe.</p>
                <p>As I mentioned before, we built these two receiving stations in California. That
                    was my next job, getting these two stations built. We had microwave links
                    between the receiving stations and the two transmitting plants.</p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>The next job I had was the rehabilitation of Bethany, Dixon and Delano. The big
                    question that came up at that time — Loomis was still in charge — was whether to
                    remove the old transmitters that had been put in out there during the last part
                    of the war — the original transmitters — or to add new ones and leave the old
                    ones in operation. Loomis's decision was to leave the old ones in, and
                    supplement them with additional transmitters. So we had to contract for the
                    design of a building expansion at both Dixon and Delano. In Bethany, instead of
                    keeping the six transmitters that were originally there — as I recall, they were
                    100 kilowatt transmitters; that's the Crosley installation, and Crosley was
                    still operating it, by the way — we decided to pull three of the 100s out and
                    put in three 250s. Charlie Affelder wrote up a set of specifications for
                    automated transmitters; I mean, automated to the extent that they could retune
                    in 30 seconds to a new frequency, by pre-setting and pushing a button. So that
                    was issued, and Collins Radio Company was the successful bidder. Continental bid
                    — Weldon's outfit — and there might have been a couple of others. Anyway,
                    Collins got the award. We were down to Dallas quite a bit during the manufacture
                    of the transmitters. We went down as a team. Charlie Affelder was sparkplugging
                    it. I was concentrating on building and installation design, and I needed the
                    information from Collins in order to design the building, to tell the contracted
                    design firm where to have openings and that sort of thing.</p>
                <p>We eventually got this all put together, and we issued invitations to bid, and we
                    got a West Coast outfit to bid on the jobthey could bid them individually or as
                    a group — Dixon, Delano and Bethany. Incidentally, the building design at
                    Bethany was a factor, too. We had to make some modifications in the building
                    there in order to put the Collins in. So that was part of the A and E job —
                    architect and engineering job, we call it. Funnything, Philco was successful in
                    bidding for the A and E job, so Philco did the design work for the buildings,
                    Collins was building the transmitters, and Philco was on Collins continually for
                    information, and I had to arbitrate. Anyway, I spent many late hours in
                    Philadelphia with Philco. We got the contract for construction in 1965 or
                    66.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Loomis left in '65.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DeLONG: Work hadn't been finished, I believe, when he left. I know it started
                    before he left, but he wasn't there for the finish of it, I believe. Anyway, one
                    of the subcontractors on the West Coast job — this guy bid for Dixon and Delano,
                    we had another contractor for Bethany. So two contractors to deal with, one for
                    Bethany and one for Dixon and Delano. We sent a crew out there. Tom Phillips was
                    in charge of Delano construction, and Ted Hamel, who came on board while we were
                    at Greenville, was in charge of the Dixon construction. Another fellow who came
                    on board during the Greenville job was in charge of Bethany. I can't remember
                    his name; he was the construction supervisor. We had three men at Dixon and
                    three men at Delano. There was an electronic engineer and either an electrical
                    or a civil engineer at each site.</p>

                </p>
                <p>DeLONG: Not at all. Not at all. I knew about them being done, but I didn't have
                    any direct relationship with them. There were other project engineers.</p>

                </p>
                <p>DeLONG: I went back once, about two or three months after I retired, but haven't
                    been back since. I've read stuff from time to time, and I've heard things about
                    how the engineering had fallen apart down there, and that sort of thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The massive increase in size is what got me. Maury
                        Raffensberger convinced Charlie Wick that he needed a vast expansion of the
                        headquarters office, and he added 130 some people and went from four
                        divisions to 17 divisions, and of course they still haven't got a
                        transmitter built as far as I know. And BIB has taken over, they're the lead
                        element in the joint construction of that transmitter in Israel.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>I don't know whether you're interested in some of the details or not, but
                    recalling the Dixon and Delano jobs — the Bethany job went pretty well, we had a
                    good contractor there, but the West Coast thing, we were fighting with the guy
                    continually all through the job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sure I want details.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>DeLONG: Well, the brick and mortar stuff went pretty good. The prime contractor
                    specialized in that so it wasn't any great problem. The electrical work was all
                    right, that is, power type electrical work. Electronics — that's where we had
                    the problem. The prime contractor subcontracted the electronic installation to
                    an outfit that specialized in refrigeration and air-conditioning. But he wanted
                    to get into electronics, so he gave the prime a price for his work that was too
                    low; this guy underbid everybody. One of the stipulations in our contract was
                    that the contractor should hire a Collins Radio Company engineer; we had
                    Collins' agreement for this. The subcontractor did not feel that he had to hire
                    a Collins Radio Company engineer; he thought all he would have to do if he had a
                    problem was get on the phone with Dallas and find out what information he
                    needed. So early on in the job we ran into trouble. I went out there once and
                    talked to the prime contractor, and said, “You know, this guy's in trouble. He's
                    going to lose his shirt.” At the time we signed the contract, the contract
                    officer and I went out on the West Coast to meet with the contractor, to
                    interview them and find out what their capabilities were. I had a gut feeling at
                    that time that this guy wasn't qualified to do the electronic work. But I said
                    to myself, “He's going to have to have a Collins Radio man here all the time;
                    all he's doing is hiring electricians and the Collins guys are going to tell the
                    electricians what to do and how to do it.” So, okay, let it go.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But he can't if he's not there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DeLONG: He can't if he's not there. Incidentally, the invitation to bid for that
                    construction included great detail on the complexity of the Collins transmitter
                    — how many pieces were involved; we even gave them drawings of the Collins
                    transmitters — not all of them but enough for anyone to understand what he was
                    up against — with the package that went out on the invitation. He knew he had to
                    assemble the transmitters essentially, on site. It didn't come in a box that you
                    just set in place; you had to put things in it. And this guy had all kinds of
                    trouble, particularly when we finally got it wired and started the testing. This
                    was when the real trouble started. Parts kept failing in the transmitter,
                    particularly vacuum capacitors. Collins Radio Company was replacing them free of
                    cost, but the contractor was raising cain about having to replace them. We
                    developed a system whereby we could record when the failures occurred, how long
                    it took to replace it, how many men were delayed and all that sort of thing. So
                    he had change orders for the failures, but all through this job he was fighting
                    having to pay the Collins guy.</p>
                <p>Well, to make a long story short, the subcontractor finally went virtually
                    bankrupt, and it was necessary for us to terminate the contract before
                    completion. And then we had to turn around and hire Collins Radio Company to
                    come out and finish the job. Of course, we deducted the cost that we had to pay
                    Collins from what we finally paid the general contractor. He in turn deducted it
                    — or didn't pay his subcontractor because of this.</p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>The guy went bankrupt. He appealed to the Congress. We had to go to the House
                    Office Building and the Small Business Administration and try to explain what
                    had happened. The fellow came to Washington and presented his side of the story.
                    It led to nothing. We couldn't do anything because it was in the contract. The
                    Small Business people said to do whatever you can for him, but that's the most
                    they could say. They couldn't order you to pay him anything. Well, he filed an
                    appeal and went through the appeal procedures with the contracting officer. We
                    had a hearing. They set up a hearing officer; not an Agency guy but I think a
                    General Accounting Office person. We had a hearing out in California, with
                    testimony just like a trial. I was a witness — a principal witness, as a matter
                    of fact. It took about two weeks to go through the hearing. Carlyle Dunaway was
                    our lawyer. The subcontractor got peanuts. They did give him some award for some
                    small things but not the major things. With the contract, it was cut and
                    dried.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about some anecdotes from the past? Interesting
                        characters who've come through the engineering shop — and there have been
                        some.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DeLONG: Well, let's see. Perhaps the most memorable character was a master
                    control man in New York, whose name escapes me. This fellow was enamored with
                    higher math, like calculus. He used to spend hours trying to figure out, for
                    example, the optimum size of a tomato can so as to make the maximum content
                    capability with the least amount of metal. He was so involved with this sort of
                    thing that one day he forgot to make a program switch and sent program material
                    scheduled for a European transmission to a transmitter in a South American
                    program: Nobody knows for how long. He didn't stay with us long. I heard later —
                    but it was never confirmed — that he joined the Manhattan Project, which
                    developed the atom bomb.</p>
                <p>Then there was Farrell, a project engineer for Jade and John. He was a bit of a
                    prima donna, and he and Ross had quite a few arguments. Jade and John were part
                    of the Ring Plan, and were the Okinawa and Philippines installations that went
                    in in the fifties. There were two plants in the Philippines, as I recall, or
                    used to be.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There's Tinang. And there's Baguio, the receiving
                        station.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DeLONG: That's it. I guess that's all there is.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But there was something in the Philippines before Tinang
                        was built.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DeLONG: Yes, that's what I'm trying to remember. There was something there before
                    Tinang, and may still be operating. I don't know. I was never out in that area.
                    I was never in the Pacific. Some other fellows — Julie Ross probably would know.
                    I'm sure he would. Hal Cupps is another.</p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>Anecdotes. In the Greenville installation, one of the funny things that happened
                    is, we designed a feed system for the antennas, going up the side of the tower,
                    held away from the tower by insulators. On the end of the insulator, because of
                    the weight and stress — you see, that plant was designed for 100 mile-an-hour
                    winds, so we have very massive towers. Anyway, this transmission line went up
                    the side of the tower to feed the antenna. It had this stand-off arrangement on
                    a long arm and on the end of it a flexible joint. When the thing was installed,
                    the transmission line twisted all the way up the tower, so we had to redesign
                    the stand-off arrangement.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was it held to the post?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DeLONG: It was on a hinge back at the tower, so the whole thing was swinging
                    around up there in the breeze. I don't know why Austin ever did that. It was a
                    structural thing. I think they were afraid of breaking the insulators. I think
                    we wound up making the attachments rigid. A lot of funny things have happened,
                    of course.</p>
                <p>The last couple of years at the Voice were not very happy years for me because Ed
                    Martin had left. I was in the middle of a project at that time, adding antennas
                    to the Dixon and Delano jobs. I went away on vacation and while I was gone Ken
                    Langenbeck (who succeeded Ed Martin) cancelled the project. We had already
                    bought the land for it. It eventually got sold off, I guess.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why did he cancel?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DeLONG: Later on it developed — I think he got in trouble later, after I left —
                    but he was promoting this outfit. There had been a salesman hounding Julie Ross
                    about selling him a curtain antenna, which was supposed to be broad-banded.
                    Julie didn't like the design at all. Langenbeck liked the design. We had a civil
                    engineer do a study of the design and at a certain wind rate — you know what a
                    curtain antenna is, it's a reflecting element behind the radiating element so
                    that it comes back in phase and adds to the outgoing signal. The distance is
                    critical between the curtain and the reflector. So this civil engineer did a
                    design study at a certain wind rate and found that the curtain would sometimes
                    go beyond the radiating element. It couldn't work. Anyway, after I left, as I
                    understand it, without getting bids, Langenbeck had this antenna installed at
                    one of the sites, and I think he got into trouble.</p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>There was a reorganization of the whole engineering group under Langenbeck. They
                    brought in specialists to do a study, and divided us up into two groups, one
                    called engineering, per se, and the other called operations engineering,
                    whatever that means. I got the job as chief of operations engineering. About all
                    I did was read the messages that came in from transmitters overseas and try to
                    evaluate the problems they were having and what to do about them. Of course, I'd
                    fought with Langenbeck about the antenna thing. I mean, after I came back and
                    found out what had happened and his proposal to buy this other antenna which we
                    opposed, we had arguments, and there are probably memos in the file some place,
                    if they haven't been destroyed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think I got out of VOA just in time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DeLONG: I know I did. Charlie Affelder and I left the same day. I was just three
                    months short of being 37 years with the Voice.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Except for those last couple of years, did you ever have
                        any regrets that you didn't go back to Hollywood?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DeLONG: No. I would never have gotten the experience in Hollywood that I got with
                    VOA. If I'd stayed in Hollywood I might have wound up at CBS or NBC out there,
                    something like that. That would have been about as far as I would have
                    gotten.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You wouldn't have attended conferences in Mexico City and
                        Paris.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DeLONG: I wouldn't have had the world travel I've had. I've been to all the
                    European relay stations and Liberia. Funny thing, they turned one project over
                    to operations engineering. Just before I left they had assigned the Botswana
                    project to us. I left before that ever got off the ground, hardly. We'd done
                    some preliminary work on it, that's all.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So is there anything that you'd like to add that we
                        haven't touched on?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>DeLONG: For the record, I'm not really a graduate engineer. At the time I got out
                    of high school I didn't know what I was going to do. I took a general course in
                    high school. A shoe salesman I knew, who had turned into a radio salesman,
                    suggested to me that I visit the local radio stations and see this equipment and
                    talk to their chief engineers which I did. And I was impressed by the tubes and
                    the glamour and whatever. So I asked, “Where do you find out about this stuff?”
                    He said, “There's a school in Los Angeles called the Radio School of L.A., in
                    the YMCA building.” Remember this is 1929 I'm talking about — 1929. Radio wasn't
                    too old in those days, and universities weren't issuing degrees in electronics.
                    You could be an electrical engineer, but you didn't have any real
                    specialization.</p>
                <p>I signed up and went to the Radio School of L.A. for nine months, learned all
                    about electricity — as much as necessary, say. They had a handbook called
                    Morecroft's Principles of Radio Engineering, a book about two inches thick,
                    which was our text book. I had to learn code. At this time I thought, “Gee, it'd
                    be nice to go out to sea and be a ship operator.” So after I finished the course
                    and got my second class commercial radio license — issued at that time by the
                    Department of Commerce — I thought, “Well, I'll go to sea.” I ran into another
                    salesman, who had been a theater manager at a theater I went to as a kid, and I
                    told him what I was doing and he said, “Well, when you get your license, come
                    and see me; I might be able to help you.” He was selling time at a local radio
                    station. So I went up to see him and got introduced to his boss. They had a
                    nighttime job available on a small panel, on which it was necessary every
                    half-hour to move some plugs around in jacks, so as to route some circuits.
                    That's how I started, ten bucks a week.</p>
                <p>I went back into the school one morning to see if they had any ships calling for
                    operators. There weren't any, but my name was on the bulletin board: See Larry
                    Snell at such and such a number. Incidentally, this is how I got the ten dollar
                    a week job: I called Larry Snell on the phone and he said, “We've got this
                    thing, and you have to work from six to midnight, and route these programs.”
                    There was one panel about 20 inches wide and about six feet high. There were two
                    radio stations. One was in Inglewood, California, and one was in Hollywood, and
                    this panel was in downtown Los Angeles. They had remotes at that time, dance
                    pick-ups, various things downtown that they wanted to get to these stations. So
                    instead of buying lines all the way to both stations they'd route them in to
                    this place and then switch them around. That was my job. Ten bucks a week. Then
                    I started doing remotes, going out and making pick-ups at dance halls and stuff
                    like that.</p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>In 1933, they moved one of the transmitting plants into L.A. from Inglewood, put
                    the antenna towers on top of a building, and installed a new Western Electric
                    transmitter. You only needed one studio for this station and one announce booth.
                    I worked as an operator at the station, opened the station in the morning and
                    ran the first half hour by announcing records till the regular announcer showed
                    up. I worked at that until 1935. I did a little bit of horse-work, too. The
                    transmitter never worked right. They could hear us great in Denver and Columbus
                    but not in Los Angeles — way down in the mud. (Laughter) So every night the
                    antenna would go up and down; we'd try something different. Nothing worked.</p>
                <p>It turned out that the height of the building was such that the ground plane
                    wasn't in the right place for the antenna, and we were getting all sky wave,
                    nothing on the ground. So we got great DX but no local coverage, and of course
                    the people buying time on the station were not very happy. We never did get rid
                    of it, until we moved the transmitter out of that building. At that time, Cal
                    Applegate was chief engineer of the station, but Cal soon went to Warner
                    Brothers and two years later called me up and asked, “Would you like to come to
                    Warner's?” I did. When he went to Warner's, I became chief engineer of KRKD at
                    age 23. I was the youngest chief engineer in L.A. While I was in that job I
                    doubled the power of the station by adding an amplifier to the transmitter which
                    I built myself — my first construction job.</p>
                <p>So much for my lifetime at the voice.</p>
