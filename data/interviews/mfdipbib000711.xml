                <p>Interviewed by: Charles Stuart Kennedy</p>
                <p>Initial interview date: June 26, 1998</p>

                <p>Q: Today is the 26th of June 1998. This is an interview with Mark Lore, L-O-R-E.
                    No middle initial?</p>
                <p>LORE: No.</p>
                <p>Q: This is being done on behalf of the Association for Diplomatic Studies and
                    Training and I'm Charles Stuart Kennedy. Well, to begin with, could you talk
                    about when, where you were born and something about your family?</p>
                <p>LORE: I was born in September 1938 in New York City. My father was an active
                    journalist. My grandfather was a well-known writer for the New York Post, an
                    expert on German politics which was pretty relevant in those years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORE: My father worked for my grandfather and also as the years went by developed
                    his own career in radio and broadcasting and later in the advertising world. My
                    mother and father were divorced when I was four years old. My mother was a
                    psychiatric social worker and she raised my brother and me subsequent to the
                    divorce. We were an East Coast family. My mother had grown up on the East Coast;
                    my father was a native of Brooklyn. So I always lived in that area until I went
                    away to college.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you go to school? I'm talking about elementary
                        grades and all.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>LORE: P.S. 33 in Manhattan was my grade school. When I entered the sixth grade I
                    started at Fort Lee Junior-Senior High School. Fort Lee is a very close-in
                    suburb of New York on the New Jersey side right where the George Washington
                    Bridge meets the Palisades. I lived in Fort Lee, graduated from high school
                    there and subsequently went for a year to Fairleigh Dickinson University in
                    northern New Jersey as a commuter, but got tired of that. In those years it was
                    relatively easy for college students with minimal means to go away to school in
                    the Midwest. State schools were very charitable with their out-of-state fees. I
                    went to Bowling Green State University in Ohio for the rest of my college
                    education. I graduated as an undergraduate in 1960.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'd like to go back a bit. In grade school, high school,
                        whawere your major interests?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORE: In high school, I was interested in music. I played instruments, saxophone.
                    I was, I think, very much involved in history and anthropology. I didn't study
                    anthropology, but I was very interested in museums of natural history,
                    paleontology, the sort of things that I think have become much more popular in
                    recent years, such as dinosaurs and prehistory. So I think at that time that was
                    where I focused quite a bit. I was not much interested in public affairs in
                    those years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about at Fairleigh Dickinson? How do you spell
                        Fairleigh,by the way?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORE: Fairleigh is F-A-I-R-L-E-I-G-H.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There, what were you taking?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORE: General liberal arts. I didn't have a clear idea of what I wanted to
                    pursue. Several courses that greatly impressed me were things that you didn't
                    get in high school, at least in those years, about world politics.</p>
                <p>Q: In this time before you went away to school, were you getting plugged in at
                    all on the international field? I mean, your father and grandfather had been
                    dealing with the world, you might say. Did that intrude at all in your...?</p>
                <p>LORE: You would have thought so, but my memory of those years and continuing on
                    into college was one of relative indifference to current events and to foreign
                    affairs. I think as much as anything it was a sign of the times. The late
                    fifties were not a time when people were greatly focused on subtleties. I mean,
                    there was the Cold War and that was it.</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>Q: At Bowling Green, Ohio, it's in the heartland of the United States, but you're
                    not looking out at either the Pacific or the Atlantic there. Did you find there
                    was anything stirring, internationally, in your education exposure?</p>
                <p>LORE: No, there wasn't much interest in foreign affairs in a place like Bowling
                    Green in those years and in that environment in the late '50s. I think my
                    interest in the Foreign Service however, was peaked during the latter part of my
                    time there. I remember taking a political science course, undergraduate
                    political science, nothing very sophisticated. But the professor was well
                    acquainted with the State Department. He may have served in the State Department
                    as a civil servant. In any case, he talked to me about taking the test, as he
                    talked to others, I think, and that sort of stuck with me later on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you graduated, what, 1960?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORE: 1960.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you pointed towards?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORE: I was pointed towards getting a graduate degree in English, in literature,
                    and becoming an English and literature professor. That was sort of the thing I
                    was doing. I had a minor in American studies. But my assumption was that I would
                    teach Great Books. But I had difficulty in really developing much enthusiasm for
                    that. The job market for that kind of thing was already beginning to weaken
                    although it was much better than it is today. But I think rather what happened
                    was I went straight from university into the Army. I had an ROTC commission and
                    I served in the military for four and a half years. This was the period of the
                    Kennedy administration and like many others I was caught up in the enthusiasm
                    for foreign affairs, for the world role, for “Ask not what you can do for
                    yourself...” and so on, “What you can do for your country?” This seemed to be
                    the area that was more interesting and with more leisure time working more or
                    less a normal day in my Army duties, I had time to read and get caught up in
                    this area. I decided that foreign affairs was something I wanted to pursue.</p>
                <p>Q: Well, you were in the Army for four and a half years, which is beyond the
                    normal ROTC obligatory time, so I take it you wanted to stay for a little while
                    longer.</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>LORE: I looked at the Army as a possible option for a career. When I got to the
                    end of my two-year obligation there didn't seem to be anything on the horizon. I
                    had by that time just taken the Foreign Service test, but I wasn't sure I wanted
                    to join the State Department. Like many others I took the test in part just
                    because it was a useful way to test your education at no cost. Many people take
                    the test for that reason. So without any other real options - life was good, I
                    liked the Army, I seemed to do well in it - I signed up for indefinite status.
                    Which meant I could leave any time with proper notice if I wasn't in certain
                    billets. But I immediately got thrown into one of those billets because I was
                    sent overseas.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What had you been doing for the first two years?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORE: I was a Nike-Hercules officer, an air defense officer. These stations have
                    pretty much vanished now, if not completely. But you remember, the suburbs of
                    U.S. cities were surrounded by Nike installations to shoot down attacking
                    bombers. I worked in the Chicago area for several years at a Nike site in
                    suburban Chicago serving as a platoon leader for both radar and for missile
                    preparation. I was also executive officer of the battery. So it was a somewhat
                    atypical Army experience in that I wasn't on a big base.</p>
                <p>Q: Just about two weeks ago I was interviewing somebody whose name I can't
                    remember who was an enlisted man with a Nike unit protecting Philadelphia and
                    ended up as the unit librarian and had been a very indifferent student and
                    started reading the good books through. Somebody gave them a set of the Chicago
                    series of the good books and he ended up going for his doctorate, I think, and
                    eventually ended up in the Foreign Service.I mean, this is a real career
                    change.</p>
                <p>LORE: For a young person who isn't quite sure what he wants to do, the military
                    can be a very nice port of call. You're making a decent salary and much is
                    taking care of for you. So many of the usual vicissitudes of life are smoothed
                    over by the way the military operates. Your life is relatively uncomplicated and
                    you can give more attention to delving into things you might be interested
                    in.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you get assigned overseas?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORE: One of the reasons I wanted the indefinite status was because I knew I
                    would be assigned overseas. I thought this would be a good way to test my desire
                    to live overseas as a career. Unfortunately I was assigned to probably the one
                    place outside the continental United States where there was no civilization or
                    accessible local culture to speak of. That was Greenland.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh my God!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORE: There are a few Eskimos and the Danes who still administer the territory to
                    this day, but it was really a pretty isolated spot. But that is where I was
                    sent. To Thule, Greenland, which is about 700 miles south of the North Pole and
                    about 500 miles north of the Arctic Circle. I was assigned there for a year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Radar, or part of the...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORE: It was a missile defense battery. There was a battalion of four sites that
                    surrounded the large Thule Air Base. Thule Air Base was in its time a very
                    strategic location. It had been a major base for our SAC fleet, for the
                    Strategic Air Force Command which was essentially our first line of defense.
                    When SAC left in the late fifties, however, the base continued to be important
                    because a huge B-MEWS radar was installed there. I guess they're still up there
                    in Alaska, northern England, Greenland. You have these huge radars, bigger than
                    a football field that could spot incoming missiles - ICBMs - as they came over
                    the horizon from the Soviet Union. So our mission was to protect that radar from
                    attacks. So I continued to do the same kind of work but in a different
                    environment.</p>
                <p>Q: Obviously, there wasn't a lot of time for getting out and seeing the country
                    and all that. There wasn't much to do. How did you spend your time?</p>
                <p>LORE: You have a lot of time on your hands. You did a lot of shopping. First of
                    all, you went to the PX a lot. You bought a lot of stuff at very cheap prices,
                    because you really had nothing to do with your money. You had craft shops, you
                    had gyms, you actually kept in pretty good shape just because you had the time
                    to do it. You did a lot of reading. I played a lot of Parcheesi. Television was
                    limited to a local armed forces station. It was pretty crude by today's
                    standards. But you kept busy. Q: You did this for about a year and then
                    what?</p>
                <p>LORE: Came back to the States. I was married during the time I was in Greenland.
                    During that year you could come back to the States on leave. My fianc�e - Sandy
                    - and I decided to get married at that point. So I had left for Greenland
                    engaged, but ended the tour as a married man. My wife and I wanted to set up
                    housekeeping and we thought the best thing to do would be to find an assignment
                    in the Washington area since my name was on the list for the Foreign Service and
                    I wanted to avoid a move if possible. So I was assigned to a Nike Hawk unit,
                    which is mobile air defense, at Fort Meade in Maryland. We got an apartment in
                    Laurel, Maryland and I worked there from September of 1964 until January of
                    1965. I got the call from the State Department in December of '64.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You obviously took the oral examination. Do you
                        recalanything...how it went, any questions?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>LORE: I do. I took the oral examination in Chicago before leaving for Thule. I
                    had a board of three officers, one I remember was from USAID, the other two I
                    believe were from State. A couple of the questions have stuck with me over the
                    years. One was to explain the Monroe Doctrine and its various corollaries. I was
                    also asked to imagine that I was in Caracas, Venezuela as a young embassy
                    officer and I was called into the ambassador's office and told the president was
                    going to make a state visit to Caracas. “We're going to make you the control
                    officer,” he says “and I want you to go back to your office and sit down and
                    take fifteen minutes and sketch out what are the main things that need doing and
                    in what order of priority.” I thought that was a very good question for the
                    Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>I was asked to imagine myself in a foreign country and approached by a national
                    who said, “Look, I'm very interested in the United States. My theory is that we
                    can learn the most about a country by consulting a variety of its newspapers.
                    I'm not necessarily looking for the best newspapers, but the ones that seem to
                    have a particular personality. Journalistically they might even be among the
                    worst, but they have a particular personality that says something about American
                    culture. I don't have all the time in the world, so I can take five
                    subscriptions. What are the five papers that you would suggest?”.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you come up with? Did you remember?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORE: I have trouble remembering now. I obviously said the New York Times. I
                    probably said the Washington Post. I think I said the Los Angeles Times. I think
                    I said the Saint Louis Post Dispatch. I might have said the Miami Herald. But
                    those are the ones I would immediately think of today. As a cross-section I
                    might even throw in something like the New York Post, just to give an idea of
                    the yellow press in the United States. But I thought that was a good question,
                    too. There was a question about economics in which I was very weak in at the
                    time, I'd never had an economics course. I had quickly read a copy of the
                    Samuelson textbook before the exam. I was asked a question about a plant manager
                    would deal with a particular labor cost issue. I broke a cardinal rule in these
                    orals which is, if you don't know, say so. I tried to bluff my way through it,
                    and at the end when I was called back in to be told I had passed, they said,
                    “but please learn some economics.”</p>
                <p>Q: Well, I think I was told exactly the same thing. While you were out at Fort
                    Meade, and Laurel and all, were you beginning to do some reading up about
                    international affairs and what the Foreign Service was about and all that?</p>
                <p>LORE: I was. Once I had taken the test, and passed the orals, the idea of a
                    foreign service career tended to gain a certain momentum. The stint in Thule was
                    not unhelpful in that regard because I was able to do quite a bit of reading. So
                    I did catch up on the issues, but I never had the sort of classical foreign
                    affairs education that you might get at Tufts or at Georgetown.</p>

                <p>LORE: January '65. As an army officer, I just missed the first Johnson build-up
                    into Vietnam. If I had been called for a class in March, I probably could not
                    have left the Army.</p>

                <p>LORE: In December of '64, it was relatively easy to walk your papers around and
                    be out in a week or two. Everything was getting buttoned down and frozen as of
                    February '65. I would never have joined the Foreign Service in that case. I
                    would have gone off to Vietnam, I would have become a major, I would have had
                    some time invested, I would have made an Army career.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you describe your basic officer course, called the

                </p>
                <p>LORE: I can't remember a lot about it. There were standard briefings on various
                    aspects of Foreign Service life - how to handle your finances, medical
                    insurance, etc. I do recall some general briefings on international situations,
                    on geopolitics, on terrorism. But much of it has faded from memory.</p>
                <p>Q: How big was it and what did it include as far as people go?</p>
                <p>LORE: We had a relatively large class. I guess we must have been about 40 in
                    number. I was coming in my late 20s and thought that I was going to be the old
                    man of the class. In point of fact I was right at the median. There were a
                    number of people older than I. That was my first discovery of the peculiar
                    nature of the Foreign Service, that so many people do join after doing other
                    things and don't jump in at the beginning. I think it's a real strength.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LORE: Yes. They came from all walks of life. They were not, for the most part,
                    foreign affairs experts. They had not studied at Georgetown or Tufts. They were
                    pretty much people like me.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LORE: We had several women. Nowhere near the percentage you would have today.
                    Women in the class were definitely a minority. The picture of my class hangs in
                    the Foreign Service Club now and I look at it occasionally and I marvel at the
                    composition of the class. No minorities, no Hispanics I can recall, no blacks.
                    It was pretty much white middle-class males.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At that time did you have anything you wanted to do?
                        Either specialty or an area or anything like that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORE: No, I was pretty much an open book. I hadn't lived overseas - Thule doesn't
                    really count - in fact I had never traveled overseas. You know, a brief visit to
                    a Mexican border town when I was doing my basic missile education in the Army
                    was my only experience outside the country. I had no preconceived ideas. I
                    didn't speak any foreign languages. I didn't have any strong driving interests.
                    So I was fairly open to anything. My initial choices, and in fact a good part of
                    my career, really were defined by my language preferences. Since I didn't speak
                    a foreign language, I aimed for a world language and I thought Portuguese would
                    be an interesting change from the usual Spanish or French. Portuguese at that
                    time was taught in Rio de Janeiro that made it very attractive also. So it's a
                    case of your choice of the language tends to define much of the way your career
                    went.</p>

                <p>LORE: We went to Rio. I indicated a preference for Portuguese, they honored that.
                    At that time you went down to Rio. We found ourselves, to our great surprise,
                    because most people after you came in the Service, your various courses,
                    consular, A-100, and language and all the rest, you didn't get out to post until
                    sometime in the latter half of the year you entered, after six-eight months. By
                    early April we were suddenly in Rio. We arrived there without speaking
                    Portuguese and went right into intensive Portuguese training in the embassy

                </p>
                <p>LORE: Much about Rio's special atmosphere remains the same today. It is very
                    sultry, with unique topography and beauty. This city itself is rather plain.
                    That is to say, the man-made buildings are generally not distinguished by great
                    architecture. They haven't done much in terms of preserving the old colonial
                    buildings, so the streetscape can be rather bland. However, you loose sight of
                    that because of the fantastic topography and the terrific street life. The
                    combination of the tropical vegetation which cascades down the mountains right
                    to the sea and the city sort of laid out through these mountains.</p>
                <p>Rio's topography makes its tremendous disparity of income unusually visible. Many
                    of the poor live in favelas, the urban slums, on the mountain sides. Unlike
                    Washington, DC or Sao Paulo in Brazil or many other cities which spread out
                    laterally, the rich look up from their affluent neighborhoods and can see the
                    poor. For their part, the poor are not as isolated, off in geographically
                    distant areas. So that if you go to Washington you can spend years and never
                    really see abject poverty if you stick to the Mall and Northwest and a place
                    where the more affluent live. In Rio that's not possible. The poor and the rich
                    are cheek to jowl because the poor live on the mountains just above the affluent
                    housing areas of Copacabana and Ipanema.</p>

                <p>Brazil was just beginning its second year under the military dictatorship. There
                    was still the feeling among Brazilians and I think in the American embassy that
                    this was a temporary state of being. That it was perhaps regrettable that the
                    military had taken over, but that the military who were running the place from
                    General Castelo Branco on down, were right-minded people - people who really
                    wanted to introduce reform. It was viewed as a more benevolent version of the
                    Pinochet regime which later ran Chile. Our expectation was that the Brazilian
                    military would get the economy right and then quickly hand a stable government
                    back to the civilians. It was viewed on the whole, particularly given the Cold
                    War mentality of the time, as a necessary evil that was going to be good for
                    both Brazil and for the United States in the long run. So there was a fair
                    amount of optimism. Brazilians were still optimistic; even if there was protest
                    and some unhappiness at having the military running the government, it was
                    relatively muted.</p>
                <p>There wasn't at that time an oppressive feeling of authoritarianism in Rio or in
                    the country, at least that I could see as a foreigner. The press was quite free,
                    people were quite free, people spoke in opposition on television to the
                    military's rule, at least in those years. It was quite an open environment so
                    you didn't feel like you were living in an oppressive dictatorship by any means.
                    It was a delightful place for people who had never been overseas to suddenly
                    parachute into. Once we got some Portuguese under our belts it was very
                    stimulating. The Brazilians are extremely kind with people who try to speak
                    their language and very supportive, so you are able to practice a lot. They also
                    don't speak a lot of English. So it was a very good environment for a first-tour
                    officer and spouse.</p>
                <p>Q: Did you find that you were plugging into the young executive part of Brazilian
                    society, people of sort of comparable age and moving into business or politics
                    or what have you?</p>
                <p>LORE: Not so much in Rio. You have to remember that we arrived in April of '65.
                    The first three and a half months were consumed with language training and
                    getting settled and we left the following April for Brasilia. So we had
                    relatively little time. My wife had a medical problem in the middle of this,
                    too. She had to go up to Gorgas Hospital in Panama. So we weren't really able to
                    get to know many Brazilians in Rio. Another thing was that the embassy was
                    enormous. It was one of the two or three biggest American embassies in the
                    world. Lincoln Gordon was the ambassador, the framer of the Alliance for
                    Progress. It was to be the touchstone for the Alliance for Progress. We had
                    money, we had a willing government which wanted the money and was willing to do
                    the things with it that we requested. Our AID mission was enormous. So a junior
                    officer like me felt rather lost in that environment. Very frankly, it was hard
                    to do any substantive business because people were fighting for the crumbs - too
                    much staff for too little work. When I heard about the rather desperate state of
                    our embassy office in the new capital of Brasilia volunteered to go up and work
                    there, where I felt I could do more interesting things. So we found ourselves by
                    April of '66 in Brasilia.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LORE: Brasilia was fascinating. It was a new capital, it had been inaugurated in
                    1960. It was still quite unfinished. There was red dust everywhere because they
                    had not planted the large areas, particularly the central mall area of Brasilia.
                    It is a very dry, almost desert-like environment for part of the year. This red
                    dirt would blow into the tiny gaps in houses and in clothes. It was everywhere.
                    There was very little in the way of entertainment. There was one movie theater
                    or two, there were very few restaurants, certainly none that were very
                    appetizing. It was in a lot of ways an African assignment. It was too far
                    removed from Rio or Sao Paulo to easily travel to these places if you weren't a
                    Brazilian congressman with your way paid.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LORE: I was a junior officer and at that time you were what they calle“central
                    complement” on your first assignment. You moved from one function to another.
                    USIA still does this with their new officers...You moved around the embassy
                    working in different sections. I had done some economic work and some consular
                    work in Rio, so the idea was I would do political and admin in Brasilia. I
                    started off doing the political work but it was largely sort of catch-all of
                    political and economic. We had a very small staff, very few people. I worked for
                    Herb Okun who was my principal officer and he really had a gaggle of several
                    junior officers. For various reasons there wasn't much in the way of middle
                    grade.</p>
                <p>I worked a lot on land sales. This sounds dry, but it was fascinating because at
                    that time there were some unscrupulous operators out of the United States who
                    had brought up lands in central Brazil and were trying to sell them as
                    retirement spots to mostly Middle Western farmers in this country. They had
                    glossy brochures that gave the impression that these lots were overlooking the
                    city of Brasilia - which they were not. They were 50-75 miles away in the middle
                    of Brazil's central savanna, worth very little money even today. We couldn't do
                    much to get these farmers' money back, but we worked with the Brazilians to
                    confirm the land deeds, at least. It was a very interesting issue and you had
                    the feeling, unlike in Rio where there were so many people, you had the feeling
                    you were making a real contribution to improving a situation that had been
                    inflicted on many unsuspecting U.S. citizens.</p>

                <p>I did a lot of that, I covered the congress, covered what bills and issues that
                    the congress was working which were of interest to us. At that time the congress
                    was still operating, later it was closed down. It had some power. I had some
                    dealings with the foreign ministry detachment there, but most of the foreign
                    ministry was still back in Rio.</p>
                <p>Q: Were you running across everybody on the Brazilian side, hated being in
                    Brasilia and they were on their way trying to get back, at least for the weekend
                    or something, to Rio?</p>
                <p>LORE: Let's put it this way. The legislators or congress people, as they still do
                    today, would flee Brasilia on the weekend and go back home. Those that had
                    money, even if they were in the bureaucracy, would get out every chance they
                    could. That includes the small cadre of Brazilian diplomats, who were preparing
                    the way for the installation of the foreign ministry. I often tell the story
                    that, during a typical day, I would go over to the congress and I would talk to
                    people, staffers, about what was happening on certain bills we were interested
                    in. I'd come back to the office at three, four o'clock in the afternoon, and I
                    would often get a call from the Brazilian foreign ministry people wanting to
                    know what the news was up there in the congress. So every now and again I was in
                    the curious position of reporting to the country's foreign ministry on what its
                    own congress was doing.</p>
                <p>In those days, Brasilia was not regarded by Brazilian diplomats as prime duty for
                    obvious reasons. But in that group and in other ministries, the military, the
                    private sector, there was a group of young, hard-charging Brazilians who saw
                    that they could really make some difference and they could vault ahead of others
                    in their careers if they took Brasilia seriously and grabbed the responsibility
                    that was out there. It was, after all, the capital of the country. So you had
                    some very attractive young people, more or less contemporaries of mine, who were
                    a lot of fun to get to know. It was uniquely easy to get to know Brazilians in
                    the Brasilia of that day; there were Brazilians from all over the country, not
                    just from one area, and many became leaders later on.</p>
                <p>Q: Speaking of young, sort of aggressive people. Herb Okun and I came into the
                    Foreign Service together. Very bright but very difficult person. I've heard that
                    his time in Brasilia was not a happy one for many people. How did you find
                    working for Herb?</p>
                <p>LORE: I found it good. He was a good mentor, he was a good teacher. I was a
                    junior officer, first tour. I didn't have any particular vanity about my work. I
                    was learning and so I had no difficulty in having Herb take out his big scissors
                    and cut up my drafts and give them back to me in pieces and in a suggested
                    rearrangement. Some more senior people who had been in the Service for a few
                    years and felt that they knew the business didn't suffer this editing quite that
                    well. Herb did not have a fine touch. My relationship with him was excellent,
                    but it was partly because I was junior. I was in Brasilia because, very frankly,
                    Herb could not keep middle grade officers up there due to his rather
                    heavy-handed managerial style.</p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>Q: How did you find the Brazilian congress? I mean this is a very crucial time.
                    Were they getting along with the military government? What was your
                    impression?</p>
                <p>LORE: The congress at the time was still pretty active. But there were definite
                    limits. I'm often reminded of the old Edward G. Robinson movies of the '30s -
                    you know, the scene where he'd walk into a room and people would be disputing
                    and arguing about this and that and he'd take out a great big pistol and he'd
                    slap it on the table in front of him and suddenly nobody had any arguments. He
                    didn't need to use the pistol. Brasilia in the 60's was that sort of
                    environment. Everybody knew that the military would only go so far in
                    entertaining opposition. But at the same time there were not any frontal moves
                    against the congress at that time. There was some criticism, but we were not at
                    the point which Brazil reached later on where there was wholesale attacks on
                    opposition congressmen, banishing them from Brazil, taking away their political
                    rights. We were still only in the first stages of that process. The military
                    rulers at the beginning hoped to get through without resort to open
                    repression.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about contacts with the military? In Brasilia itself,
                        whaabout the military?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORE: It was all in Rio. There was virtually nothing in Brasilia. There were very
                    few military officers up there. Those that were there would be rather senior,
                    including, of course, the president himself. They would be contacts for the
                    ambassador when he would come up from Rio or for Herb Okun, perhaps.</p>
                <p>Q: I was wondering, you had been a military officer long enough to have acquired
                    the patina of...you could speak as a military man. Was this helpful?</p>
                <p>LORE: I suppose it was in a certain way. I think it proved more helpful later on
                    in my career. I don't recall Brasilia or Rio as being places where I was able to
                    use that very much. We had such a huge military mission, and of course with
                    General Vernon Walters' particular access and prestige, the State Department
                    officers had a relatively minor role in contacts with the military.</p>
                <p>Q: Well, Brazil had become much of the focus of your career. What was your
                    impression of regionalism, through the congress and elsewhere? You're up in a
                    place where you're removed from sort of that incestuous Rio crowd and all that.
                    Did you get a feel that Brazil was more than just Rio at this particular
                    time?</p>
                <p>LORE: Well, certainly Brasilia was different. There were still debates going on
                    at that time about just abandoning Brasilia. However, the Brazilian military
                    quickly decided that Brasilia served their interests very nicely.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why, they get away from the street mobs and that sort of
                        thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>LORE: Yes, I think it was much easier for them to run the country out of
                    Brasilia. Even today, Brasilia, the way it's built, discourages demonstrations.
                    Demonstrations are swallowed up in those great empty spaces. If there had been
                    any serious problems with opposition demonstrations, they could have rolled
                    tanks right down the middle of the city's broad avenues. Therefore, it would
                    have been very easy to contain any overt opposition. It was also, I think, just
                    nice to be away from the stew of politics and pressure groups in places like Rio
                    or Sao Paulo. So the military found it rather convenient. If there had been no
                    coup, Brasilia's fate might have been different; I think Kubitschek's immediate
                    civilian successors, Quadros and then Goulart detested Brasilia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was Kubitschek's idea, right?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORE: It was Kubitschek's idea. As I said, I think it's quite possible that
                    during the '60s if there hadn't been a military coup that there might have been
                    an at least partial reversion of the capital back to Rio. Certainly the
                    bureaucracy's movement to it would have been slowed. But the military decided
                    they liked it and by the time the military left power years later it was firmly
                    ensconced.</p>
                <p>Q: But Brasilia, the idea of Brasilia was to make it more representative of the
                    whole country and all of that. Were you getting any of that feeling?</p>
                <p>LORE: Well, you did meet people from all over the country. There were no native
                    residents; government servants had to come in from everywhere. But even today
                    you don't get much of a feel for the country in Brasilia and that's a real
                    drawback. You get a much better feel for the country in Rio despite its
                    peculiarities; despite its uniqueness, it's very typically Brazilian in a lot of
                    ways. Brasilia remains a rather drab and monotonous environment — although not
                    without its own natural beauty. If you go outside the city, the countryside can
                    be quite scenic. The central plateau remains relatively virgin and unpopulated.
                    In those years there were very few people so you could drive for miles and never
                    see anything.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about Sao Paulo. Did that have its own dynamics that
                        yowere seeing reflected in Brasilia?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORE: Sao Paulo was certainly at that time emerging as the major city of Brazil,
                    but it was contesting with Rio. Rio was still viewed by most people as the true
                    capital of Brazil and most companies were headquartered in Rio. There was a
                    large financial and business infrastructure in Rio, some of which still
                    remains.</p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>So Rio was and is an important city in commercial terms but Sao Paulo was
                    becoming become the combination of New York, Los Angeles and Detroit that it is
                    today. It was a very big city, a very confusing place. I saw very little of Sao
                    Paulo when I was there in those years because it was difficult to get to. The
                    road between Rio and Sao Paulo, a narrow national two or three lane affair then,
                    is now a high-speed limited access highway. There was no train and air service
                    was expensive. So Sao Paulo for people who lived in Rio was a long way away.
                    It's closer now with the air shuttle and modern communications.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you were there until '66. Did you get any feel for
                        threlationship between Herb Okun and the ambassador was still...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORE: Lincoln Gordon left in my second year. After I got to Brasilia, John
                    Tuthill was ambassador. I didn't have much feel for Herb's relationships in the
                    mission. I would guess that Herb was held in high esteem. He was very able and
                    very smart. Herb's problems, such as they were, were more with subordinate staff
                    rather than with the embassy front office.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In '66 you left, '67?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORE: I left in '66. We had planned on at least a year in Brasilia. The
                    Department at that time assigned junior officers on a “central complement” basis
                    that is over an above normal staff. At a large post, when the powers that be
                    decided that you were okay — you were not going to be an abject failure — you
                    became fair game for assignment into a regular funded position someplace else.
                    In the second half of '66 Ed Marks was the junior officer in Luanda, Angola, a
                    consulate at that time in a territory under Portuguese control. He was
                    transferred to an economic officer position in Zambia and I suddenly received a
                    cable saying “Proceed directly from Brasilia to Luanda.” So by October of '66 we
                    were in Luanda.</p>

                    What was Angola like? First place you were in Angola from '66...?</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>LORE: Angola was on the surface a kind of baby Brazil. The topography, the
                    vegetation, the Portuguese culture and the racial mix all suggested a kind of a
                    Brazil in Africa. There were a lot of links. So it was a comfortable
                    environment. Of course, politically, it was very different. It was a colony of
                    Portugal. The Portuguese had been engaged since 1961 in a very vicious war
                    against black nationalist insurgents who were trying to kick them out. During
                    the time I was there, '66 through '68, the Portuguese effort had doubled and
                    redoubled. It had reached its peak during my time. There were, as I recall,
                    something like 50,000-60,000 Portuguese troops in Angola and that, along with a
                    large-scale campaign of moving poor Portuguese settlers down to Angola to inject
                    a white presence and a sort of stability in the interior created a situation
                    where the insurgents were fairly marginalized. The insurgents themselves were
                    fighting tribally based vendettas amongst each other. So the Portuguese were
                    pretty firmly in control but only by dint of force of arms, not by the fact that
                    they had any significant allegiance among the African population.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It would have been a consulate general at that point,
                        right?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORE: That's right.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was Luanda as a consulate general like? How was it
                        staffeand all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORE: It was a very small post. It had the consulate general rank for a number of
                    reasons. Portuguese Africa was a problem for the Kennedy administration. We
                    wanted to keep good relations with our NATO ally Portugal. We particularly
                    didn't want to endanger our presence in the Lages base in the Azores. At the
                    same time Kennedy was under some pressure to accommodate African-American
                    opinion on the colonial issue. So, symbolically, these two little posts, the one
                    in Angola and the other in Lourenco Marques in Mozambique were put under the
                    African bureau in the State Department — to the great unhappiness of our
                    ambassador in Lisbon. They were upgraded to consulate general rank to convey
                    that we saw these territories as other than colonies of Portugal. We had taken
                    some symbolic anti-Portugal votes in the UN which, just before my arrival,
                    resulted in some serious violence against the consulate. The U.S. vote against
                    Portugal in the UN, voting for self-determination of the Portuguese colonies,
                    caused a mob to attack the Consulate general cars and throw them in the bay.</p>

                <p>LORE: It was a Portuguese mob, a white Portuguese mob. The consulate had four
                    officers; the consul general was Harvey Summ. I was the junior of the four. I
                    had a great job for a junior officer. My duties were essentially to take care of
                    the administration and the consular obligations of the post which were minimal,
                    and spent a good bit of my time traveling around the province, as it was called,
                    and reporting on the guerrilla war.</p>

                        to ouembassy in Lisbon, or was it just sort of...sent something,
                        information?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORE: We never cleared anything with our ambassador in Lisbon. In fact, to do so
                    would have subjected us to criticism from the African bureau. We were supposed
                    to be independent. As I say, our ambassador in Lisbon wasn't crazy about that.
                    They were, during my time, Ridgway Knight and Tapley Bennett. They were both
                    professionals and they understood. They visited Angola. While it's hard not to
                    act as the ambassador, they understood there was a certain difference in how a
                    US official dealt with our hosts down there since we had this political
                    objective of seeming to not recognize Portuguese dominion there indefinitely —
                    although we did recognize it in fact. So the division of duties was fairly
                    clear. We didn't clash very much with the embassy in Lisbon. We reported on what
                    was going on the ground in these areas, how the war was going, what these
                    colonial societies were like. Were there winds of change? To the degree we
                    could, we reported on local African attitudes, although these were very hard to
                    ascertain. The embassy in Lisbon really reported on how the Portuguese
                    government viewed the question and on the terms of the bilateral
                    relationship.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LORE: It was Salazar when I got there and Caetano by the time I left.</p>
                <p>Q: What about your dealings with this? First place, it sounded like it would have
                    been a difficult situation if the Portuguese were putting in essentially
                    blue-collar Portuguese and giving them a hunk of land and all of this, that they
                    wouldn't be very amenable to dealing well with the black population or...It
                    would be a rather intractable sort of (inaudible).</p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>LORE: I think the Portuguese were trapped by their own myth of racial harmony,
                    their own so-called civilizing mission. In point of fact, by injecting
                    significant numbers of white settlers into Angola, they created racial tensions
                    and a racial pecking order that didn't exist before. American and other foreign
                    visitors would come to Luanda and Portuguese officials would show them around
                    and brag about the fact that here, unlike any other place in Africa, you had
                    white taxi drivers, you had white ditch diggers, you had white waiters, you had
                    whites doing menial jobs and living in the poorest areas. It was a point of
                    pride — this showed the racial democracy that was developing in the colony. The
                    reality was, in fact, that Africans resented this tremendously since importing
                    whites barred the way for them to be taxi drivers, or waiters, or ditch diggers
                    and they didn't see this as a desirable state of things.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about blacks? Were there many blacks who had moved
                        uthrough the bureaucracy or in business and all who became contacts?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORE: Very few. Virtually none. There was a small group of mulatto, what we would
                    call blacks, but they were distinguished as mulattos. They often moved in white
                    society, often had white wives, had received education in Lisbon and were in the
                    professional class and in some cases, in the bureaucracy. But they constituted
                    very small number and many of them had become disaffected. Some of them had
                    become active and were leaders in the resistance movements, others had just left
                    the country or moved to Portugal to be away from the war. So you dealt almost
                    exclusively with a white bureaucracy and power structure in Angola. Now there
                    was a white settler elite that never reached the level of what you had in
                    Rhodesia next door. There was some nascent complaining about Lisbon and some
                    would occasionally expressed a desire to break away Rhodesia-style. It never
                    came to anything because they knew that if the Portuguese government left, they
                    wouldn't have a chance against the black majority.</p>
                <p>Q: I assume you were dealing mainly with Portuguese bureaucrats, weren't you?</p>
                <p>LORE: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression? Were they sort of the typical,
                        whaone thinks of as colonial types?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>LORE: Yes, I would say so. Many of them, particularly out in the field, were
                    quite similar to what you see in films, and histories of the British or French
                    empires. Being Portuguese, they lived more humbly than perhaps some other
                    Europeans did. They often came from a poor or humble background. There was not a
                    lot of ostentation and pomp in Portuguese colonialism, even in the capital,
                    Luanda. It doesn't go with the Portuguese character. Portugal at that time was
                    trying very hard, pouring an enormous amount of money and military force into
                    Angola and Mozambique. In fact this led directly to the eventual revolution in
                    metropolitan Portugal in '74 because the country itself was bled white. It's a
                    good example of how a colonial power's attempts to sustain its possessions
                    becomes suicidal because in order to keep the lands you have to put so much into
                    them that you pauperize your own constituents in the home country.</p>
                <p>Q: What about the Portuguese military? I would have thought they would have not
                    have been very forthcoming to the Americans there since we had this pretty
                    obvious anti-colonial thrust to our African policy.</p>
                <p>LORE: There were individuals who were suspicious. There were individuals who
                    would make snide remarks. But during the time I was there I think the feeling
                    among the Portuguese was that Portugal's attempts to stabilize the situation
                    were on the upswing. They were looking for investment from the Western
                    countries. They thought that they had suffered the worst they were going to
                    suffer in the UN. And as Portuguese, they had for the most part a very favorable
                    attitude about the United States. Some of the settlers were actually more
                    difficult, but the settlers didn't have much political power. They made noise,
                    but they didn't have political power. So I would say that my experience was
                    largely a friendly one.</p>
                <p>I remember that we did a little sort of homegrown USIA effort in the consulate
                    for Portuguese who were interested in learning English and practicing their
                    English. Every week we would get together. I decided at one point it would be
                    fun to show the movie about Kennedy which was around at that time, Years of
                    Lightening, Day of Drums, you remember that. George Stevens, As an American I
                    found it a very moving movie. I showed it, the lights went up, and there was a
                    very, very chilly reception. Remember that these were people coming to the
                    consulate because they liked Americans and they wanted to learn English. But
                    they immediately said, “You know, he's the guy who voted against us in the UN.
                    We'll never forgive him.” They were very resentful of that. But Kennedy had been
                    dead for several years by that time and I think their feeling was that relations
                    with the U.S. were now on a different track.</p>
                <p>However some Portuguese, more in the civilian side than in the military side,
                    would say that, “You Americans, you just want to get us out of here so that you
                    can have this for yourselves.” My answer always was, look; we were at the worst
                    point of...the high watermark in Vietnam. We had enough problems. We didn't need
                    another one in terms of instability in a resource rich country in the third
                    world. We wanted Portugal to be a force for stability, we just didn't think that
                    it was going about it in the right way, by denying eventual independence and
                    self expression in the African territories. But you wouldn't find much of an
                    audience for that point of view.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LORE: No, we had no access to them. They were on the other side of the line. To
                    have contacted them then would have required that we be out of country. Even
                    then, if the Portuguese learned of such contacts, we would probably have been
                    expelled from Luanda. So we left those contacts to our colleagues in embassies
                    in independent African countries on the periphery - in Zambia or the Congo,
                    Zaire, and elsewhere such as in Europe, where these organizations had
                    representation. We did not have contacts with them.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LORE: Well, as I say, the white settler elite in Angola, which was a small group,
                    felt to be Angolan, not Portuguese. They had lived most if not all of their
                    lives in Angola...They looked at the Rhodesia events with sympathy and would
                    have liked to have been able to do the same thing but they did not have the
                    power position or the military position to protect themselves and they knew it.
                    They weren't big enough and so they never made any serious attempts. Plus the
                    fact that those 60,000-70,000 troops in Angola from the metropole were also a
                    force for making sure that white settlers didn't cause any problems.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LORE: They benefited from having farm boys as troops in that these men were able
                    to put up with a relatively low level of comfort. They could live in the field
                    for long stretches easily and without complaint. They required less of a supply
                    chain than, say, a American army would. But they also showed very little
                    interest in aggressive pursuit of the guerrillas. They did only what was
                    absolutely necessary. There was not the kind of imaginative initiative that
                    might have possibly curtailed the threat definitively. That's, of course, also
                    on the political side as well as on the military side.</p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>The Portuguese took a very limited military approach. Units went out, they
                    basically oversaw the collecting of large groups of native Africans into secure
                    villages. They were a presence and yet there was no real political agenda in
                    terms of the underlying issue of white foreign rule. So without that, the
                    military didn't have much to do except to keep the guerillas marginalized. As
                    for the guerillas themselves, they did suffer some deaths, but were left largely
                    alone. It was rather a stalemate. The Portuguese were able to control a good
                    part of the country but at any given time, the insurgents, if they wanted to
                    move in an area probably could. This undercut the psychological security of the
                    white population and of the troop units.</p>
                <p>So the Portuguese, despite their overwhelming presence, never felt very secure.
                    The Portuguese military was armed at a fairly basic level. Most of them viewed
                    the war as something to get through, to put in their time. This was true of
                    officers as well as enlisted...put in their time and get out without being hurt
                    rather than going in there with any enthusiasm to accomplish a larger
                    geopolitical goal.</p>

                        iMozambique? Did you see that as sort of a mirror image of Angola?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORE: We certainly read each other's reporting. During the period I was in
                    Angola, the Portuguese were in a much more tenuous position in Mozambique. This
                    was both because of the geography of the country because there were far fewer
                    whites in Mozambique. Also, there were strong white supremacist views among the
                    settler whites in Mozambique due to the racial influence of South Africa. The
                    Portuguese authorities were distressed by such racism, because it undercut the
                    multiracial image they were trying to propagate. Finally the Mozambican guerilla
                    group was larger, better disciplined, and a more formidable force, with secure
                    bases in Tanzania next door. The Portuguese largely were not in control in
                    northern Mozambique and accepted that. That didn't really have a correlation in
                    Angola.</p>
                <p>Q: In sort of trying to capture the spirit of the times, how much would you and
                    your fellow officers of the consulate general...Do we feel there was the Soviet
                    hand in what was happening there?</p>
                <p>LORE: I don't recall seeing it as a Cold War issue. I don't think the
                    administration in Washington did either. We were constrained in that we had this
                    tremendous need for the Azores. But we in Angola didn't live with that day by
                    day. That wasn't something we had to worry about. We saw the situation on the
                    ground as something that was doomed to change, winds of history and all that,
                    and we didn't see it really as a Cold War issue. It was obvious that the Chinese
                    and the Russians were exploiting the situation for their own ends, but we
                    primarily blamed the Portuguese for allowing inroads by these unfriendly powers
                    in important segments of the African populations - probably including the future
                    leadership - by their obdurate policy.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LORE: It was a small group. Like many African posts there is really a lot of
                    reason to stick together and be tolerant of other people's behavior. We all had
                    our jobs to do. I remember relations as being fairly good. Towards the end of my
                    time three of the four officers were all about the same age, with broadly
                    similar personalities. Several of us remain friends to this day. So I think
                    relationships were good. The consul general, Harvey Summ, made no bones of the
                    fact that he had been sent there with instructions to tighten things up a bit.
                    This had been a very sleepy equatorial African post in years past; he was
                    interested in instilling some more discipline into the operation, but he was a
                    good manager and I think he was well liked. There were remarkably few tensions
                    given the possibility for them in the consulate during my time there.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Social life? How was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORE: Social life was active, it was good. There were a number of consulates
                    there so you dealt a lot with the foreign community. You dealt a lot with the
                    Portuguese bureaucracy and elite. You did not deal much with Africans for
                    reasons I've mentioned. There were very few Africans of any prominence. I, as a
                    junior officer, had particular responsibility to develop relationships with the
                    sort of mulatto elite, which was very interesting. These people seemed to be
                    quite apolitical and never talked about politics and I didn't press them because
                    it was a serious business. This was an authoritarian state. The secret police
                    were omnipresent and you could get people in real trouble, you might even be
                    risking their lives by compromising them. But I was struck by the fact that when
                    Sandy and I were about to Angola, we were offered a goodbye luncheon at one of
                    the mulatto's houses - just when Salazar had taken his spill out of a chair from
                    which he never recovered.</p>

                <p>LORE: He fell out of a chair and as an elderly man, you know, falls are often
                    fatal to elderly people, and he never really recovered and he was replaced a few
                    months later by Caetano and then eventually he died. But he had just taken this
                    fall out of his chair and I was struck by the very sharp and acerbic jokes at
                    this luncheon about Salazar himself and about the white Portuguese. I had to
                    conclude that, since I was leaving, people felt free to talk in a way they
                    didn't when I was there.</p>
                <p>Q: Did you feel yourself attracted towards might be called the Africanist core in

                    towards?</p>

                <p>LORE: In Angola, of course, one often didn't have the sense of being in Africa.
                    You were in Africa physically, but you were dealing with whites. When I left
                    Angola, I was assigned to be the Portuguese African desk officer in the African
                    Bureau. Probably during that time I felt more of an attraction to an Africanist
                    specialty, since I was dealing with people who had served around the continent.
                    But it never really developed that way for various reasons.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left in '68 and went back to Washington?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORE: Went back to Washington. The incumbent as Portuguese African desk officer
                    still had six months to go so the African Bureau worked a deal where I suddenly
                    found myself in the economic training course at FSI, the six-month economic
                    course. I hadn't requested it, although I wasn't opposed at all to the idea. At
                    the time, it was ironic; it was very difficult to get into. It was sought after.
                    So I did the course and then went onto the Portuguese African desk in what was
                    purely political work, not an economic job at all. David Newsom was the
                    assistant secretary. The bureau was, I think, a good bureau at that time. Newsom
                    was a very good assistant secretary. I liked working with him very much.
                    Obviously, the southern African issues were paramount for him in those years, so
                    we in the Office of Southern African Affairs got a lot of attention. But the
                    White House was completely uninterested - in fact, even opposed to what the
                    African Bureau wanted to achieve in Africa. You remember, this is the Nixon
                    administration and there was a great deal of sympathy for the white ruling
                    regimes.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in the African Bureau from '68 to...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORE: Let's see, it would be '68 to '72. The last period of that time, six or
                    eight months, I was working in the economic policy shop in AF, not the
                    Portuguese African side.</p>
                <p>Q: I wonder if you would care to comment, before we turn to the Portuguese
                    African side, about the economic course. How did you find it and how useful was
                    it?</p>
                <p>LORE: It was very difficult, as I think it is today. If anything it was more
                    difficult at that time because the State Department had not gotten into the
                    computer age at all. At that time I remember doing our calculations on Burroughs
                    office machines. It was very well done, however. I had never had any economics
                    so it was a cold shower, but a very useful one. It turned me into an economic
                    officer which I remained being throughout the rest of my career. The physical
                    conditions were difficult. The tower over there in Rosslyn was not the greatest
                    place to do a course, particularly an intensive course of that sort. It was
                    difficult to do it when you were just coming back from overseas and getting
                    settled at the same time. But it was a good course and I've always regarded it
                    as one of the more valuable things I've done in the Foreign Service.</p>

                        What weryour responsibilities?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORE: My responsibilities were to assert the Africa Bureau's interests and
                    concerns in the policy process in the State Department, particularly, on
                    Portuguese African issues. You were constantly plucking the sleeve of the
                    European Bureau which represented Portugal and which, both because it was the
                    European Bureau and because it had all the ambassadors and all the sovereign
                    entities involved on its side, was a formidable foe. Ted Briggs was the
                    Portuguese desk officer at that time. He was, of course, a very able person, but
                    a very professional one as well. While he made sure that his own bureau's
                    interests and the interests of the relationships with Portugal were observed, we
                    had a good working relationship.</p>
                <p>It was an unusual desk, because you were representing an important bureau
                    interest but without a constituency. You didn't have an ambassador, you didn't
                    have a resident embassy in Washington, and you didn't have bilateral relations.
                    You were essentially reflecting the African Bureau's general concern with our
                    credibility on the colonial issue with the Nigerians, to the Ugandans, to the
                    Kenyans, to other people rather than to the Angolans or the Mozambicans as such.
                    It was an awkward issue. A lot of it was concerned with arms control questions.
                    We had an arms embargo on the Portuguese concerning application in Africa. At
                    the same time we gave and sold large quantities of arms to Portugal for use in
                    the NATO area. There were constant charges about that the Portuguese were
                    subverting this control and sending arms into Africa. We had elaborate ways of
                    trying to follow this up. We worked a lot with the intelligence community. In
                    sum, you were walking a line which pleased neither the European-oriented, NATO
                    advocates in the U.S. policy community nor the African advocates. Given our
                    conflicting interests, this was probably just about right.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LORE: No, I have to say that there wasn't...either during the time I was in
                    Angola or when I was on the desk. No one could really forecast an end to
                    Portuguese control. The rebel groups were divided. The Portuguese had shown a
                    willingness to do what was required militarily. There was some consideration of
                    very mild reform measures, politically, but nothing approaching independence.
                    There was no imminent chance that Portugal was going to be overthrown on the
                    ground in AfricBut then, suddenly, the Portuguese military overthrew the
                    civilian government in 1974. They displayed an extraordinary amount of
                    discipline and secretiveness in keeping their internal discussions and
                    unhappiness away from foreign observers. Very few if any people, whether in or
                    out of the U.S. government or out of the government saw the Portuguese
                    revolution coming. On the other hand, when I was in Angola, we generally felt
                    that if there was going to be a change, it would be in Lisbon, it wouldn't be in
                    Luanda. That's essentially what happened. It took a coup d'etat in Portugal for
                    everything to be overthrown and no one saw it coming, including, famously, the
                    embassy in Lisbon, which had not forecast it at all.</p>

                        tougfighting was going on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORE: Guinea-Bissau was the one area where the Portuguese were in real difficulty
                    militarily, and probably would not have survived militarily. That was the one
                    area wherPortugal might have been ousted by force. General Spinola, who was a
                    very flamboyant general, quite un-Portuguese, in charge of the fight in
                    Guinea-Bissau, got a lot of publicity with his attempts to stabilize the
                    situation. In point of fact, he became the author of a plan for a kind of
                    dominion status for Guinea-Bissau which was rejected by the Caetano government.
                    That was the first breach in the Portuguese establishment - when there began to
                    be public discussion of that sort of outcome.</p>
                <p>The Portuguese Guinea rebel group, the PAIGC as they called it at that time, was
                    the best led and the best integrated with the population of any of the groups.
                    It had the benefit of working in a very small country sandwiched between two
                    friendly (to it) countries, Senegal and French Guinea, and it was led by Amilcar
                    Cabral, whom I met in Washington during those years as a desk officer. He was a
                    very admirable person in a lot of ways, influenced by his communist sponsors,
                    but still, I think a genuine revolutionary.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>LORE: No, it was a cheap investment for the Soviet Union and for China. They
                    provided a few arms. They didn't provide any trainers, much less direct military
                    advisors on the ground. They provided some cash and some arms. It was a cheap
                    investment for them and there was no complication because they didn't care about
                    their relationships with Portugal.</p>
                <p>Q: On the reverse side, on our side, this later became, particularly Angola
                    became, the CIA became very much involved. But at this period I assume that the
                    intelligence efforts were rather minor?</p>
                <p>LORE: Yes. There was not much of an U.S. intelligence presence in the Portuguese
                    African territories. There was a presence in surrounding capitals that had
                    contact with the insurgent groups and in fact gave some help to some of the
                    insurgent groups to maintain our influence with them. Something the Portuguese,
                    of course, greatly resented. But there wasn't much they could do about it.</p>
                <p>Q: This is tape two, side one with Mark Lore. Kissinger and his time as national
                    security advisor I take it had not turned his focus at all on Africa. That came
                    much later.</p>
                <p>LORE: I think the only White House interest in Africa was to redress what they
                    felt was an imbalance in our approach, to show more sympathy for the white
                    regimes. The feeling was that these regimes were going to be there for the
                    indefinite future and that we had important strategic interests with the
                    Portuguese and in a different way with South Africa that needed to be taken care
                    of. The Nixon White House often saw the State Department as unreasonable in some
                    of our policy actions towards the white rulers of southern Africa. This was the
                    basis for the famous NSDM, or NSDD 38, I think it was, from those years which
                    proclaimed a more pro-white U.S. policy in southern Africa.</p>
                <p>After the Portuguese revolution - when I, was not working in the area any longer
                    - many of us who were familiar with southern Africa were frankly appalled by
                    Kissinger's attempt during the Ford administration to intervene on the side of
                    the same people who were being supported by South Africa, in Angola
                    particularly. The reasoning seemed to be simple Cold War logic, that you had
                    Cuba and the Russians supporting one side, so we didn't care if it was South
                    Africa, or whoever it was, we were going to support the other side. We're still
                    living with the results of that. From the Cold War point of view, the idea was
                    we could not take a hit, we could not see our guys lose because this would have
                    global implications. It was the containment policy gone berserk inmy view, but
                    it was what ruled American policy in the mid '70s after the Portuguese had
                    left.</p>
                <p>Q: This is a little bit before the fact, but did you have any impression of the
                    relative ability, strength, or whatever you want to call it of our embassy in
                    Lisbon at that time?</p>
                <p>LORE: Relative to what?</p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>Q: I'm just thinking after the revolution, it was felt our embassy was rather
                    weakly staffed and they sent Frank Carlucci and I guess Herb Okun, who went in
                    there and really turned things around. I was wondering how we felt about the
                    embassy in Portugal?</p>
                <p>LORE: The embassy had been allowed to drift. We had some pretty strong
                    ambassadors during the time I was in Angola, but the embassy had drifted
                    somewhat. The ambassador at the time of the revolution was a political
                    appointee, a very prestigious, well regarded senior lawyer from, I think New
                    York, who had been the legal advisor in the Department. He was a very
                    accomplished but elderly man with little background in Portuguese or African
                    issues. He was not the man to be in Portugal at that time. He didn't have the
                    background, didn't speak the language, didn't attract the kind of staff that you
                    needed.</p>
                <p>The story goes that Kissinger, when he came in as Secretary, wanted his own
                    person as legal advisor and sent off...I'm blanking on the name of the man...but
                    he sent off the incumbent to Portugal just to get rid of him. Shortly thereafter
                    the revolution occurred and as you say, there was consternation because you had
                    what looked like a communist-influenced group running the Portuguese government,
                    a NATO ally. So Carlucci and Okun and others went out there and did a tremendous
                    job at really supporting forces of democracy, Mario Soares in particular, and
                    helping to bring about consolidation of Portuguese democracy. It was quite a
                    job.</p>
                <p>Q: What was sort of the spirit? I mean, this was your first Washington assignment
                    and sort of the spirit of the African Bureau. What you were dealing with was not
                    a sleepy situation. You have active rebellion going on in all the areas that you
                    were concerned with. This was your first exposure to Washington and to the
                    African Bureau. Did you feel you were a corps apart, somewhat? Sort of united
                    and somewhat neglected?</p>
                <p>LORE: I think that puts it well. I think that the African Bureau has always been
                    probably the most collegial of the geographic bureaus in the Department. Most of
                    its people have lived in Africa, often in difficult circumstances. So they tend
                    to rally around and be more emotionally involved in policy. It's also, I think,
                    been collegial because it tends to be shunted to the side by the White House and
                    by the Seventh Floor of the State Department. African concerns are never
                    paramount, even in this administration. So at that time we had a very good
                    Assistant Secretary who, I think, was very popular in the bureau. But also the
                    feeling that things were going badly for the African Bureau, that the White
                    House wanted a more pro-European, pro-white settler policy. Rhodesian sanctions
                    were under severe attack. As we saw, the Congress essentially overturned them in
                    those years. So the whole movement was towards lowering the importance of U.S.
                    relations with black African states.</p>

                <p>LORE: I think that environment had some effect on they way I looked at it. When
                    it came time to go overseas again...I was first assigned to Vietnam in the CORDS
                    operation. I was, as were many people in my cohort at that time, quite unhappy
                    about this for both policy and personal reasons. This was the time in which the
                    Department had failed in its attempts to pressure new officers to go off and do
                    village resettlement operations in Vietnam - so it began to select more middle
                    grade officers whom they felt would have less liberty to say “No.” My wife and I
                    were in the process of adopting a baby at that time which would have been
                    completely stopped in its tracks by my going off to Vietnam. On that basis I was
                    relieved of that assignment and I was told informally that in point of fact the
                    whole thing was falling apart in terms of State operating the CORDS program.
                    Shortly thereafter AID took it over and basically went out and paid contractors
                    to do that work.</p>
                <p>So I never went to Vietnam, but I was told to find a place to work for awhile in
                    the State Department and do honest work and not go off to Paris or someplace
                    pleasant. So when I finally came around to assignment overseas I had a choice of
                    Quito or Rabat, both middle grade economic slots. I needed an economic
                    assignment, I really hadn't had one overseas. I didn't want to learn Spanish in
                    those years because I felt that would type me as a Latin American specialist. I
                    liked the idea of learning French, so we went to Morocco. Morocco was in the
                    African Bureau so it seemed to continue my Africanist direction. In point of
                    fact, Morocco is really not an African country. It is a Middle Eastern country
                    and that was recognized during my tour when it was moved over into NEA.</p>
                <p>Q: Before we stop this particular session, being in the Department of State '68
                    to '72, there was an awful amount of turmoil in the country and within the State
                    Department over Vietnam. Did the events of 1970, the Cambodia invasion, or any
                    other time, how did Vietnam impact on you and maybe some of your
                    colleagues...our involvement there?</p>
                <p>LORE: Certainly, I think that most Foreign Service Officers of my generation,
                    this is just my impression in Washington, citing polls, had real questions about
                    policy, about the militarization of our efforts there. I think it discouraged a
                    whole generation from getting into Asian affairs because of distaste for our
                    southeast Asian policy. Plus, very frankly, a fear of getting blown up.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes! Dangerous out there!</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>LORE: So people tended to avoid Asian assignments. There was a negative effect on
                    our ability to staff our posts there and get the kind of people that EAP people
                    would want. But we were too old to join the flag burning opposition to U.S.
                    policy, the spear-carriers for those who felt that all U.S. foreign policy was
                    suspect and illegitimate. I think that we as foreign affairs professionals
                    didn't go anywhere near that far. We tried to avoid involvement in the Vietnam
                    policy to the degree we could. Some people couldn't, those are the Tony Lakes
                    and Dick Holbrookes who left. If I had been told that I had to go to Vietnam, I
                    think that I probably would not have stayed in the Foreign Service for both
                    personal and policy reasons. So it was serious, but I would not make too much of
                    it as an ideological opposition.</p>
                <p>Q: Were there any reverberations throughout the State Department during the
                    spring of 1970 when there was incursion into Cambodia and officers were signing
                    petitions and all that? Did that sort of bypass you all?</p>
                <p>LORE: In 1970 I was still in the African Bureau so day by day it wasn't that
                    pressing an event within the State Department. The people I dealt with viewed it
                    more as newspaper readers than...it didn't represent an issue they were working
                    on. I can remember, however, the tremendous outpouring of opposition in the
                    country at large. The weekend of the Cambodia invasion my wife and I were in
                    Williamsburg and I can still remember the card tables for petition signing set
                    up along the streets in Williamsburg by students and others...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: William and Mary.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORE: Either William and Mary or other college students. The weather was nice. It
                    was mid-year sometime, I'm not sure if college was in session. But that's my
                    memory of the Cambodia invasion. People with petitions out there in
                    Williamsburg, Virginia...You know, there's a mindset in the State Department
                    that it's not viewed as seemly to get on a soapbox on an issue, particularly if
                    you're not working on that issue. That it is just not part of the culture. So
                    that if you're in the African Bureau, you as an American citizen, as a newspaper
                    reader, may have certain views, but you don't walk around the State Department
                    and stand over the water cooler grabbing people's sleeves and arguing with them.
                    You stay quiet. It's not because you're afraid of people, you're not
                    intimidated, it's just not part of the culture. It's not viewed as appropriate.
                    You're not there to stand on a soapbox.</p>
                <p>So I think that in various times in my career I've encountered situations where,
                    still today, there is something very dramatic going on, very controversial, but
                    there is remarkably little discussion among people in the Department. People
                    just don't feel that it's wise to get into issues that don't directly impact on
                    their work. In some sense it compromises your credibility in pursuing the work
                    that you are being paid to do.</p>

                <p>Q: Okay, what we'll do the next time, I put this at the end of the tapes so we
                    know where we're picking up, we'll pick this up, you're off in 1970 to
                    Rabat.</p>
                <p>LORE: In 1972.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I mean, 1972 to Rabat.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>***</p>
                <p>Today is July 9, 1998. Mark, we're off to Rabat, 1972. Did this come as a
                    surprise or was it a requested assignment, or how did it come about?</p>
                <p>LORE: It was a requested assignment. It was a position that was at my grade. It
                    was an economic position. I had taken the FSI six-month economic course and had
                    not done any economic work. I obviously needed a working economic assignment, it
                    was time to go abroad, and it was one of two or three possibilities. I was
                    attracted by the chance to learn French in addition to my Portuguese.</p>
                <p>Q: When you got to Morocco, 1972, when you first arrived could you describe the
                    state of the country as you saw it and maybe as the embassy saw it?</p>
                <p>LORE: It was an interesting time. As I was doing my consultations preparatory to
                    going out, a number of people congratulated me on going out to a place that was
                    about to explode, a place where the government would change. There had been two
                    attempted coup attempts against the king of Morocco in the summer of '71 and the
                    summer of '72.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: '71 was the birthday party and '72 was the airplane,
                        attempt tshoot him down.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORE: Exactly, you've got it right. So the general feeling was that you had
                    another Libya in the making in Morocco and Foreign Service Officers being what
                    they are, people felt this was professionally great, I was going at a good time.
                    When I arrived in Morocco it was a difficult time for the American embassy
                    because the 1972 attempt had been spearheaded by U.S. trained Moroccan pilots
                    flying U.S. furnished aircraft out of a U.S. controlled base in northern
                    Morocco. The king, not surprisingly, suspected U.S. connivance with the plot to
                    remove him from power and to kill him in the process. The attempt was to shoot
                    down his private plane coming back from France that summer. I didn't think at
                    the time, and I've never thought since that there was anything to that — what
                    would the U.S. have to gain in doing away with a close friend and ally?
                    Nevertheless, the king was at least standoffish, not being quite sure who in the
                    U.S. government might have known or should have known about the coup
                    attempt.</p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>Some of the young Moroccan pilots, U.S. trained pilots, were married to American
                    women. This increased the impression that the U.S. was abandoning Hassan. The
                    embassy thus was in somewhat of a cold freeze as regards the palace. Late that
                    summer and early fall there was a show trial of the pilots which was
                    exhaustively reported in the local press. By the way, the Moroccan press was,
                    and I think still is, remarkably free. You're not allowed to criticize the king
                    as the king directly but otherwise there is a great deal of freedom. Obviously,
                    the government in this case did not try to stand in the way of almost verbatim
                    reporting of the proceedings. So it was a very tense time and nervous time for
                    the American embassy. That dissipated by the winter, however. Whether the king
                    decided to put his suspicions aside or for whatever other reasons, relations
                    appeared to return to normal during much of my tour.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the embassy go through the exercise of trying to find
                        ouwhat possible American influences might have been on these pilots?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORE: I expect so, although I wasn't involved or privy to any such consultations.
                    I'm sure that various people in the embassy were looking at this as well as some
                    people in places in Washington, but it wasn't something I was involved in.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was our ambassador then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORE: Our ambassador at the time of my arrival was Stuart Rockwell, career
                    Foreign Service Officer who had been DCM in Teheran, preceding this assignment.
                    He was essentially an Arabist and an old line, old style diplomat. Very
                    courteous, but somewhat reserved in his manner and reserved and somewhat distant
                    from the rest of the staff.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was he there the whole time you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORE: No, he left probably before he expected to because the White House wanted
                    to put a political appointee in the position. This was at the time that
                    Watergate was beginning to unravel. Remember that Nixon gave one of his famous
                    speeches in which he announced the firing of Haldeman.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was his chief of staff.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>LORE: His chief of staff. It was only shortly thereafter that suddenly the word
                    came that there would be a new ambassador in Rabat. The new ambassador, Robert
                    Neumann came from Afghanistan where he had been ambassador for seven years.
                    Neumann was a California Republican who, in 1964, headed up Republicans for
                    Johnson. When Nixon was elected California Republicans came to him and said,
                    “You may not like this guy.” Of course, both Nixon and Haldeman were California
                    Republicans who knew very well why they didn't like Bob Neumann. Nevertheless,
                    it was argued by some powerful people in the Senate and elsewhere that you had
                    to give this guy, who was a foreign policy expert, a job in the new
                    administration. Neumann was sent to Afghanistan, which was an even more
                    undesirable and distant place than it is now. He was allowed, the scuttlebutt
                    said, to essentially just sit there for seven years. The talk was that the White
                    House wanted to just wear him out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It must have been Johnson who put him in then,
                        because...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORE: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Johnson put him in.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORE: That's right. Johnson put him in but the new Nixon White House was
                    prevailed upon to leave him there in order that he...because he did have
                    powerful friends in Washington. But they vowed that they would never do anything
                    else for him. When Haldeman fell out of power, however, that is said to have
                    released him from bondage and he showed up in Rabat soon afterwards as the new
                    ambassador. He was the ambassador for about 14-16 months of my tour.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find him as ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>LORE: He was a man who was very sure of himself. Very sure of his opinions. He's
                    often been compared to having a kind of Kissingerian style about him. Not only
                    the German accent but also an academic who views his opinions as more worthy
                    than those of most other people. He didn't take much of an interest in economics
                    so my embassy section didn't have as much to do with him as did some others. He
                    did what ambassadors to Morocco have often done, and that is he stayed close to
                    the king. He worried about the security relationship. This stood us in good
                    stead late in my tour during the October '73 war when suddenly the U.S.
                    government looked around and discovered it had no friends in the Middle East,
                    except for Hassan. It used Hassan's close ties with Sadat to develop that
                    relationship. One day we in the embassy were packing our bags and putting them
                    at the door ready to be evacuated when the war kicked off. You have to remember
                    that there were Moroccan troops on the Golan Heights and there were U.S. Naval
                    communications facilities in Morocco that were dealing with the Sixth Fleet
                    which was sending out bombers to bomb those positions on the Golan, so it was a
                    very dicey period. But Hassan realized where his interests lay and essentially
                    brokered the relationship with Sadat. The upshot was that, within a week, we
                    were no longer planning on being evacuated but rather were receiving the
                    Secretary of State for urgent consultations with the King.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Neumann, I believe is Jewish, isn't he?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORE: I believe so.</p>
                <p>Q: Did that play any factor? I'm just trying get, sort of...Morocco is sort of
                    unique in this area and I'm wondering if you could comment on that.</p>
                <p>LORE: Neumann's religion played no perceptible role in his effectiveness. Morocco
                    has traditionally been very tolerant of Jews. It's true that, during the '73
                    war, there were mutterings against the remaining Jewish population. The Jewish
                    population didn't always feel welcome in Morocco but they certainly didn't feel
                    endangered the way they did elsewhere. By and large from the king on down there
                    was an official policy of strict tolerance.</p>
                <p>Q: Did you find...again, you're sort of the fly on the wall, you're not in, sort
                    of in the political deliberations, but one of the accusations that's been made
                    against our ambassadors and our embassy in Morocco is they end up identifying so
                    closely with the king that they develop a bad case of localitis, as we call it,
                    rather than representing American interests they seem to represent Moroccan
                    interests. Was that a problem at this period? Did you observe...?</p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>LORE: I think it's always been a problem no matter who the ambassador is. Neumann
                    was not as egregious as some others have been. But the king is very skillful at
                    manipulating us. The king understands, and understood particularly at that time,
                    that the U.S. needed friends. The king needed it, wanted a tight security
                    relationship and a lot of support in the military area. Otherwise, he wanted the
                    U.S. to basically play a relatively passive role in Morocco. We were important
                    to him but I'd argue that, at least at that time, he was more important to us.
                    We needed Arab friends and Hassan was one of the only ones around. Economically,
                    he relied much more on France and on Europe than on us. The one thing we could
                    supply, military hardware, had to be fought for in competition with other
                    claimants. These circumstances inevitably made our ambassador more of an open
                    partisan in Washington. We didn't have much leverage on the Moroccans, they had
                    a lot on us.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the economic work that you were doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORE: We did standard economic reporting on the condition of the Moroccan
                    economy. I did a lot of resource reporting. The Bureau of Mines has been very
                    interested for many years in Moroccan mineral production. It's quite sizable for
                    the size of the country. Morocco was, at the time, the biggest phosphate
                    exporter in the world and one of the biggest phosphate producers, in competition
                    with us to some degree. So we did a lot of minerals reporting. We worked quite a
                    bit, particularly under ambassador Neumann, in the latter part of my tour, on
                    investment promotion. More than I have at any other post in my career. Normally,
                    U.S. economic/commercial sections focus on selling U.S. exports into the
                    country. Investment is certainly supported, but it is not as important an
                    activity. In this case, however it became very important to the embassy to
                    develop various kinds of assistance efforts for the Moroccans to attract
                    American investment into the country. That was the gist of it. Most of the
                    commercial activity was in Casablanca which is a major commercial center.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find life there as far as dealing with
                        Moroccasociety? Did you have good contacts and all? Was it difficult?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORE: Contacts are difficult. It is outwardly an easier society than many others
                    in the Middle East. It has a French veneer and many of the elite bureaucrats in
                    the foreign ministry and elsewhere that you would deal with were French-trained
                    people. They were very, very skillful at their work, multilingual, very smooth,
                    very cosmopolitan. Many of them had French wives. Scratch the surface, however,
                    and it was very difficult to get to know them very well. Moroccans, at least
                    during my time, and I suspect it's still the case, the elite Moroccans with whom
                    an embassy would tend to deal, would have two lives. One was the official life
                    in which they spoke French and did their work. The other was their personal life
                    that they kept rigorously separate and closed to foreigners for the most part.
                    Even closed to many other Moroccans.</p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>Moroccans are not an outgoing people. They're a rather insular culture and it's
                    difficult to break into that culture. I did not speak Arabic or Berber. We
                    didn't have any Berber speakers, serious Berber speakers in the embassy. But our
                    Arabic speakers, some of whom were quite fluent, including Dick Parker, the DCM,
                    had as much trouble breaking into the society as we French speakers did. It
                    wasn't a language thing, it was more a cultural thing. Parker would frequently
                    complain about the difficulty in getting to know Moroccans, where in his long
                    service in Cairo, Egypt he had found it very easy to get to meet and get to know
                    Egyptians on a personal basis.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about relations with Algeria? How were they at that
                        time iyour perspective?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORE: They were uneasy. The Algerians were supporting the Polisario Front in what
                    was Spanish Morocco. The Algerians were a revolutionary, Marxist regime. On the
                    other hand,Morocco was essentially a capitalist economy run by large firms,
                    mostly French, and a Moroccan elite - somewhat of a robber baron elite. So the
                    two countries didn't have a lot in common in the way they looked at the world.
                    The Moroccans, having suffered two coup attempts from army officers who were
                    trying to establish a fundamentalist regime in Rabat, understandably were very
                    suspicious of Algerian intentions in this area. Algeria and Morocco have
                    competed for many years. It's not helped by the fact that the Moroccans have
                    always looked down on the Algerians and in fact all others in northern Africa as
                    peasants and they regard themselves as the most culturally developed and
                    cosmopolitan people of North Africa.</p>
                <p>Q: Did you find in your economic work that you were up against the French Mafia?
                    I'm using that term very loosely. In other words, did the French establishment
                    didn't want us messing around in their area?</p>
                <p>LORE: Yes, it's a fact of life in the country. Most big contracts went to the
                    French. The French were well ensconced at all levels of the bureaucracy. But
                    there are some things that France can't provide and the king's relationship with
                    us was such that you couldn't have blatant favoritism. In the military area,
                    which of course extends into all kinds of hardware and technology, we had an
                    advantage over the French. So this was not a major issue, but certainly we were
                    always aware that the French were very sensitive to our influence in the country
                    - particularly on the commercial side, but also to some degree political.</p>
                <p>Q: You say this was your first economic post. How did you feel about both your
                    training and your sort of progress in the field of economics?</p>
                <p>LORE: The training was excellent. It's a rigorous course they give at FSI. This
                    was before, really, State entered the computer age. So I didn't get a lot of
                    quantitative economics. But the basic concepts were I think, put across quite
                    well and they were quite helpful in Morocco. The Moroccan economy was an
                    interesting third world economy.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Looking at Algeria where this revolutionary socialist
                        hard-line Marxist government came in and destroyed what seemed to be, at
                        least on the surface, a very wealthy country. They got rid of the French but
                        didn't put anything in its place, they destroyed agriculture, they did
                        everything wrong. One, were we watching the Moroccans to see whether they
                        might be tempted to go this way, and two, were the Moroccans, people you
                        talked to, looking at the Algerians and understanding the trap that they
                        might get into if they tried to get too revolutionary?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORE: There never was any inclination in Morocco to follow the Algerian example,
                    not even among the Moroccan left. First, the Moroccans look down on their North
                    African neighbors as bedouins - they see Morocco as the only cultured society in
                    the western Arabic world. Second, the organized left in Morocco such as it was,
                    such as it is, is largely trade union based and resembled Western European trade
                    union movements which did not challenge the basic capitalist model. What the
                    generals who tried to overthrow Hassan in the '71-'72 period would have done is
                    only conjecture. The fact is that Morocco has remained a stable, capitalist
                    society. The king has been skillful enough to stay on the throne, the country
                    has prospered - albeit with great income disparities - while Algeria has
                    continued to disintegrate. This of course has confirmed the views and approach
                    of Morocco's leadership elite.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LORE: No, Tangier at that time, and I suppose it's still true, has diminished in
                    importance. Essentially it is a picturesque ferry stop for tourists. It has
                    little political or economic or commercial importance. It has some cultural
                    importance. But even Moroccans don't look at Tangier with any great interest
                    because it doesn't represent for them the cultural wellsprings of their country
                    in the same way that Meknes and Fez and Marrakech and even Rabat do, the four
                    imperial cities. Tangier is sort of a fabrication largely built and peopled by
                    Europeans. You also have the historical split between French Morocco and Spanish
                    Morocco between which Tangier sat as sort of an anomaly.</p>
                <p>Q: As an economic officer and with a commercial hat too, did the Sharia law come
                    into effect? Did it have any impact on commerce? Having served as an economic
                    officer in Saudi Arabia at the end of the '50s I know that the Sharia law didn't
                    work well in modern commerce. I was wondering whether this had any
                    intrusion.</p>
                <p>LORE: You'll have to explain the Sharia law to me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, Sharia law is the law of the Koran essentially. It

                </p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>LORE: No, that wasn't a factor in Morocco. To my recollection the only thing in
                    Morocco that was traditional and Islamic in nature was the judicial system. You
                    have to recognize that the French colonized Morocco in a very different way than
                    they did Algeria. Algeria was beyond being a colony, it was considered part of
                    France. It was a department of France. In the case of Morocco, it was a
                    protectorate. It didn't belong to France, France had it by international
                    agreement to administer, but it was not a part of France and it was not a colony
                    of France. There were several other countries including the United States which
                    had a formal role as overseeing this protectorate. So the French were more
                    limited in what they could introduce.</p>
                <p>Interestingly enough though, that resulted in a situation where they allowed the
                    traditional culture to maintain its past presence and practices in terms of
                    family life, in terms of judicial institutions, in terms of local government.
                    But they built alongside it a parallel structure of essentially European
                    institutions to run the economy and to run the economic life of the country.
                    This was essentially the balance that the French struck. When the Moroccans took
                    their independence, after a relatively short fight - nothing like the Algerian
                    war of independence - the Moroccans maintained that division as something they
                    felt comfortable with. So commercial life was always quite recognizable to any
                    Westerner.</p>
                <p>Q: Did you as duty officer, as an officer of the embassy get involved in any
                    problems with American youth heading for Marrakech and other places and enjoying
                    hashish and that sort of thing?</p>
                <p>LORE: No, occasionally I did a little bit of consular work there and occasionally
                    you would have a problem with young Americans trying to smuggle, as you said,
                    hashish out of the country. Nothing more serious in those days. We didn't have
                    the problem with Americans in jail and the draconian treatment of them that you
                    find in parts of the Arab world and Turkey and Latin America today. There were
                    only a few young Americans trekking around the country. Occasionally there would
                    be a problem such as when a group of them made a stew of poison mushrooms and
                    all died. In general, Americans who were in country in those days largely kept
                    to themselves and were savvy enough to keep out of trouble.</p>

                <p>LORE: Well, I had worked in the African Bureau in Washington for some time
                    preceding the Morocco assignment. So I was beginning to look at myself as an
                    Africanist and I thought that would be the natural place to draw a next
                    assignment. I had the French. However, despite that, I was tentatively assigned
                    as the chief economic officer or chief political officer - it was never clear
                    which - in our embassy in Accra. (End of tape)</p>

                <p>LORE: I was pleased with the Accra posting because it was a good career move. The
                    assignment, however, was canceled. This was the summer of '74, was the summer of
                    the Global Outlook Program, the GLOP that Kissinger proclaimed where everybody
                    had to change their area of specialty. All assignments were reviewed to judge
                    whether the officer involved might had served too long in a particular area and
                    needed to experience a different region. Ironically, my “Africa” service had
                    been in colonial Angola and in North Africa - the latter really being part of
                    the Arab world and, in fact, as I was leaving Morocco, was moved over to NEA. So
                    I had never served in black-ruled Africa. Nevertheless, I was judged to be
                    overly specialized and the assignment was broken. I was assigned as an assistant
                    commercial attach� in Brussels. I was crestfallen. My wife was delighted.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LORE: Well, I was assigned to the commercial section and did not like it. We had
                    the usual problem of too many people for too little work. Even in the best of
                    times it seems to me that a country like Belgium and the business sector in a
                    country like Belgium can do business fairly easily without having to come to the
                    commercial section of the American Embassy. American businessmen could usually
                    find their way using virtually every multinational you can think of including
                    headhunters and accountants and banks and all the rest that were in Brussels. I
                    felt at the time and continue to feel that big commercial sections in Western
                    Europe are a pretty marginal activity. Moreover, this was a period when the U.S.
                    economy was going through some tough times, exchange rates were out of line and
                    there wasn't a lot of new trade being generated for macroeconomic reasons. So
                    there wasn't a lot to do. After almost a year of that I was asked to come
                    upstairs into the economic section to be the financial reporting officer and I
                    found that a lot more interesting.</p>
                <p>Q: On the economic side. Was Belgium... was this almost the premier international
                    economy? Because this is where almost every European corporation seems to have
                    its headquarters.</p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>LORE: The European Community Headquarters were in Brussels. Belgium itself proved
                    to be a very successful place to invest because there was ample land and
                    excellent road and water transportation. Geographically it was situated right
                    between the big markets. Labor was relatively cheap. The northern part of the
                    country boomed with incoming foreign investment particularly from large
                    petrochemical firms and others who really valued those transportation
                    advantages. So Belgium did very well by the European Community. Belgium itself
                    always regarded the Community as a way out of its language problem. The country
                    is an uncomfortable amalgam of French-speaking and Dutch-speaking peoples. The
                    general prosperity that the EC brought helped to sublimate Belgium's ethnic
                    problems — Belgians could see that supporting some sort of a Belgian national
                    identity was in the interest of stability. So it has been a very lively place
                    for American business and continues to be. In fact, during my time there, we
                    were beginning to see a great deal of reverse investment from large Belgian
                    firms and banks into the United States.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did your embassy play any role in this reverse investment?
                        Owere these people...they knew what they were doing, they did it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORE: No, we didn't play any role. It's kind of tricky for an American embassy to
                    be out actively encouraging people to take their money out of the country and
                    send it to the United States. You know, at that time Europe was entering a
                    period of very low growth, low job creation, heavy hand of the state, state
                    companies, state social insurance schemes which proved tremendously expensive
                    and so European economies were stagnant. In the late 70's, there were already
                    trends in the U.S. leading towards the so-called Reagan revolution. The new
                    focus on deregulation and liberalization of our economy was very attractive to
                    European entrepreneurs who were frustrated by the lack of opportunities within
                    Europe. So the conditions were already present for reverse investment. All the
                    U.S. government had to do was stay out of the way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was your ambassador? I imagine you had several?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>LORE: Yes. The ambassador when I arrived was Leonard Firestone. He was one of the
                    Firestone brothers and died a year or so ago. Firestone was obviously a
                    political appointee, but in an embassy like Brussels it doesn't make a lot of
                    difference. Political and commercial channels between the U.S. and Belgium are
                    well established and the Belgians were happy to have somebody who had some clout
                    at the White House. Leonard Firestone was a very courtly gentleman, very
                    courteous with his staff, low key, accessible. It wasn't unusual to go down to
                    the embassy cafeteria at ten o'clock in the morning and see him sitting around
                    drinking a cup of coffee, chatting with his secretary or with somebody from some
                    section of the embassy. He had no pretensions. He let his staff, particularly
                    his DCM who was John Renner, an experienced Foreign Service officer, pretty much
                    run things.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When the Carter administration came in '77 who came
                        out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORE: When the Carter administration came in, Anne Cox Chambers whwas from the
                    Cox communications empire replaced Firestone.</p>
                <p>Q: Based in Atlanta, wasn't it?</p>
                <p>LORE: Yes, she was from Ohio. My recollection is that this family and this
                    conglomerate has strong bases both in Atlanta and in Ohio. There was a Cox who
                    was vice president of the United States, from Ohio. She came from the Ohio
                    branch. There was no southern accent, which people often remarked on because
                    they expected to meet an Atlanta belle. She was also a wealthy contributor and
                    supporter of the political party, in this case the Democrats. That's not to say
                    she was in the Firestone class - Leonard Firestone took over the whole Hilton
                    Hotel every Christmas to throw a big party for all the embassy staff. When you
                    talk about the embassy staff in Brussels it's enormous because there is both the
                    normal embassy, a mid-sized embassy accredited to the king, added to an enormous
                    joint administrative section which serves the three missions we have in Brussels
                    - the bilateral embassy, the NATO mission, and the EC mission.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As financial officer what were you particularly looking at
                        anhow did you go about it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>LORE: We did some coverage of the Belgian economy, but relatively little. We did
                    some reporting on Belgian trade issues and Belgian trade policy, but again, even
                    at that time the Belgians were among the first to sublimate their national
                    policies to EC rules. So I dealt much more with my colleagues in the EC mission
                    in trying to understand what Belgium was doing, than with other parts of the
                    embassy. We spent a lot of time working with certain Belgians who had national
                    positions and thus were our property, so to speak, but who were very much
                    involved with the then nascent EC move towards monetary union. We had access to
                    the thinking and plans of these people and to their reporting on meetings that
                    Washington and USIS found very useful even though the issues were essentially
                    non-Belgian. That was a particular opportunity for economic reporting in
                    Brussels at that time. It probably continues to some degree because the Belgians
                    are so well fixed in the EC bureaucracy.</p>
                <p>Q: Well, there really are in many ways, you have the feeling that they have the
                    engine that's driving most of this, at least this is where sort of a lot of the
                    apparatus is recruited from and all that.</p>
                <p>LORE: Well, their own government doesn't give them a lot of room. It's a small
                    country and a small government. It has relatively few resources to work with, so
                    the most talented people obviously are working the EC agenda. Belgians have no
                    problem with this orientation; the bigger, better, more active, more intrusive,
                    and more powerful the EC apparatus is, the happier the Belgians are because they
                    see themselves more as citizens of Europe than as citizens of an entity called
                    Belgium.</p>
                <p>Q: Did you find yourself up against any sort of jurisdiction, rivalry, suspicion
                    or problems? I mean, here you are a financial officer at one of our three
                    embassies in Brussels which I would think would be sort of...particularly the
                    EC. I imagine thNATO one was not a [problem?].</p>
                <p>LORE: Yes, my EC mission colleagues down the street, literally just several doors
                    away, were aware of this and with only occasional transgressions, observed the
                    line. I tried to work with them; if I was going to be seeing a Belgian of
                    interest to them, I'd call and offer to ask any questions they had. As long as
                    they could count on my doing that, they pretty much kept their distance. Now,
                    you can never inoculate the process totally and probably shouldn't try to.
                    People would see each other socially, they would meet at various kinds of
                    meetings, they would exchange words, that was okay. What we didn't want,
                    obviously, was to have these Belgian officials sought out by EC mission people
                    on a regular basis. For their part the Belgians also wanted to observe this
                    line, and so they were cooperative in this.</p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>Q: I'm trying to catch sort of how we looked at things at this particular time,
                    we're talking around, in the '75-'78 or so, concerning the development of the
                    EC. Because I would assume, you're an economic officer, you're sitting around
                    with your colleagues who are working with the EC. Others, I mean, you're looking
                    at this thing as it developed. EC has always been sort of the key element in
                    American foreign relations in a way. Somehow getting the Europeans so they don't
                    fight each other. Yet at the same time I would think by this time there might be
                    some growing concern about, “Yes, this is fine, but what's it going to mean for
                    American trade, and are we building up a rival structure that's going to freeze
                    us out?” I was wondering, try to go back to that time and figure out how were we
                    thinking.</p>
                <p>LORE: Well, yes, I mean this was a period of growing trade discussion with the
                    EC. The post-war period was long gone -when the U.S. economy was healthy and
                    dominant while Europe's economies were recovering from the war. The emphasis in
                    those days was all political; the political value of a thriving EC overcame any
                    concerns about rivalry on the commercial side. Well, those days were passing
                    quickly or had passed. There was concern about unfair practices by the EC in
                    commercial matters. Of course these issues concerned my colleagues in the EC
                    mission more than me. We told Washington very frankly that there wasn't much we
                    could do to encourage a Belgian voice for diluting EC disciplines or subsidies.
                    The Belgian government was focused on building a prosperous EC and just would
                    not carry our water in these areas.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was to make it easier for American goods to enter the
                        market.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORE: That's right. The Belgians had nothing against American goods but they
                    weren't about to take up the cudgels for U.S. interests in this respect. Their
                    interest was more a harmonious and growing EC in which the interests of France
                    and Germany, particularly, were more important. France, Germany and Holland were
                    Belgium's major trading partners. So it's understandable that while the Belgians
                    were very polite and very helpful, within the constraints of what they could do,
                    they didn't feel they could do much. They didn't have any appetite for
                    adventurism in trying to test EC disciplines in the councils of the EC by
                    arguing for anything different.</p>

                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>LORE: No. He would occasionally call, and one of the charming aspects of the way
                    he operated, he would just call you on the phone, rather than send notes down or
                    anything else. Every once in a while he would ask you to come up and give him a
                    briefing on this or that - for instance when there was a story out about an
                    exchange rate crisis or problems with “the snake,” the band of European
                    currencies. He would want to be briefed but his demands were minimal.</p>
                <p>Q: How did you find Washington? I assume you were reporting to the Treasury too,
                    but I would suspect that Treasury probably had their own person right there,
                    didn't they?</p>
                <p>LORE: Treasury didn't have a person in Brussels. There was a Foreign Service
                    Officer who did the financial stuff out of the EC mission. I worked, as I say,
                    closely to help him on these matters. Treasury's interests in Belgium as such
                    was minimal. Most of the reporting on the larger EC financial picture was out of
                    the EC mission. This was very early in the move towards monetary union so even
                    EC wide, you wouldn't call it a big story.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any events that come to mind outside of sort of
                        thregular reporting work you were doing during this period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORE: It was a fairly routine assignment. There were not any major events. You
                    did a lot of carrying of the mail - every time Washington wanted something to
                    come out of the EC. Most of this is economic in nature. So we'd get cables
                    before council meetings. before a chiefs of state meeting of the EC, or before
                    various kinds of subcommittee meetings. There was always some sort of meeting
                    going on in the EC. The U.S. wanted to achieve certain things so it would sent
                    out these shotgun messages to every capital in the EC asking us to go in and
                    make a representation. I found that I spent inordinate amount of time, as I did
                    later in Portugal when it joined the EC, carrying these messages. One can argue
                    about how effective all this effort is, given the amount of manpower that goes
                    into it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you carried the messages what did you get? Sort of

                </p>
                <p>LORE: Yes, you didn't get much reaction because again, the Belgians with very few
                    exceptions were not willing to take a stand against the Germans and the French.
                    Now, where the Germans and French differed, they had to pick sides, but in most
                    cases that wasn't very useful for the United States.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any feel for the German and French missions to
                        the Ewhile you were there, particularly on the economic side?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>LORE: No. I had no contact to speak of with other embassies. The nature of the
                    work didn't require it. Occasionally you'd meet people socially. Interestingly
                    enough there was a side activity that I think of often these days. It was called
                    the tripartite gold commission. This was a commission created at the end of the
                    Second World War to adjudicate the claims of various countries in Europe who had
                    had their holdings of gold raided by the Nazis. This was a large operation in
                    its day, set up in Brussels for reasons that I've forgotten now. It was a
                    regular commission with people assigned to it from capitals who had full-time
                    jobs operating it.</p>
                <p>Over the years the activity dwindled down to become a residual activity by
                    embassy officers from the French, British, and American embassies. The
                    commission's secretary general, by the time I arrived, was an elderly gentleman
                    in his 80s. He is long dead now. He had started off as a relatively young man in
                    the mail room, but over the years had become the commission's font of
                    institutional knowledge. During my time, the British Embassy had given him a
                    back room, he had some files and we had occasional meetings to discuss the
                    commission's last remaining cases. We embassy officers would, in sort of Peter
                    Ustinov style, play our national identities. We would talk about the dispersal
                    of the last remaining parcels of gold - some of which didn't get released for
                    one reason or another, and may not be released to this day. The Tripartite
                    Commission sometime later on was disbanded and left to capitals. Probably some
                    of it is now bound up in the current controversy over money and other asset
                    claims from World War II.</p>
                <p>Q: There's a footnote. The controversy today in 1998 is over Nazi confiscation of
                    gold and other things from individuals, mainly Jewish and how Swiss banks,
                    Swedish banks, and maybe other banks may have profited by this. There is a lot
                    of soul searching.</p>
                <p>:LORE: The issue is somewhat different but there are some linkages. In any case,
                    that was an activity we spent some time on as well, and basically in my position
                    I was responsible for the American embassy representation on that. Interesting
                    experience, although not real lively.</p>
                <p>Q: Well, I think by this time you must have felt that you really developed your
                    economic credentials both particularly having been... some commercial work but
                    mainly financial, which was more technical. How did this serve you in the
                    future?</p>
                <p>LORE: It was a good assignment. It was the solid economic assignment I'd been
                    looking for although, as I say, there were no dramatic events. It was a typical
                    assignment for economic work in the Europe of the day. I learned a lot about the
                    European Community, about how it functions which stood me in good stead later
                    on. It also emboldened me to apply for university training in economics for
                    which I was accepted coming out of Brussels.</p>

                    training.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why Wisconsin?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORE: It's probably mostly because my wife's family is in the Chicago area. You
                    spend a career in the Foreign Service continually taking your spouse away and
                    taking grandchildren away from grandparents. The opportunity to be close by for
                    even a year is something that you look at seriously. And, of course, the
                    University of Wisconsin had and I think still has one of the most prestigious
                    economic departments in the country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm think in particularly of labor economics, but others,
                        too....</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORE: Well, they're well renowned for that, but they had a solid economics
                    department. You certainly couldn't say that you were trying to get a soft deal
                    by going to Wisconsin. It seemed a most practical way to give Sandy and our
                    still fairly young children a chance to see more of my in-laws without
                    necessarily living right next door. So Wisconsin seemed to be a good fit. FSI
                    was delighted; most applicants for university training want to do it in
                    Washington, to avoid an extra move, or go to the Kennedy School at Harvard which
                    is not regarded as the most rigorous economic training. FSI wanted to get people
                    into various locations in the country rather than have them all congregate in
                    Washington. So everybody was happy, we went off to Wisconsin for a year.</p>
                <p>Q: In the first place, what were you concentrating in the '78-'79 period at
                    Wisconsin in economics?</p>
                <p>LORE: It was awkward at first. The University of Wisconsin had never received a
                    Foreign Service Officer on this kind of training assignment. Ironically, surely
                    by coincidence, another officer had asked to go to Wisconsin for the same
                    training, the same year. The two of us showed up and the economics faculty
                    didn't know what to do with us. Wisconsin, at least at that time, had a very
                    traditional economics department. They took graduate students as Ph.D.
                    candidates. There was provision for a Master's degree, but the faculty didn't
                    assign any value to it. If they had no interest in a Master's program, they were
                    even less interested in providing a one year, non-degree graduate program for
                    government people. So they really didn't know quite what to do with us for a few
                    months. As some of them said to us later on, they thought that maybe we were
                    just there for a good time, to relax and not work.</p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>We did not have the preparation that many of the graduate students had, but we
                    worked hard to bring ourselves up to speed as best we could. I think that that
                    showed we were serious and so by the middle of the fall semester we were brought
                    into the regular graduate program; in my case at least, I did a little extra
                    work and was able to get a Master's out of it. As for the coursework, the first
                    year of graduate school has a pretty well prescribed set of courses. I focused
                    on the theoretical areas, trade and international finance. I did some statistics
                    and econometrics with which I had mixed success. Again, my preparation in
                    statistics and so on was weak. All this was useful grounding, although the heavy
                    dose of purely theoretical economics, essentially studying and building
                    mathematical models, can be frustrating to a Foreign Service Officer. I did
                    audit a course in Marxist economics which showed me the side of the University
                    of Wisconsin that many of us of our generation recognize - the radical, populist
                    side. The graduate economics group were all buttoned down, hard-working computer
                    geeks. The black sweaters and radical attitudes were over on the political side.
                    They're the ones who talked of Marxist economics.</p>
                <p>It was hard work. My objective, and I think that of many people, was not
                    necessarily to become a hard economist myself but be able to converse and
                    understand the language and concepts so that I can deal with hard economists,
                    use their work and understand it and make it intelligible to Washington. In that
                    I think I succeeded.</p>
                <p>Q: At the time, to sort of pick up the academic world and government interests
                    and all, this is in the late '70s, was there much concern about what we would
                    call today “global issues?” I'm talking about, which are economic ones, but
                    interdependent. Population, pollution, you know, some of these other things.
                    Essentially sort of the global things that are affecting everybody in the
                    world.</p>
                <p>LORE: There was. Probably not as much as you would find today, but a fair amount.
                    The focus of international economics and finance then and now was very much the
                    nation state, individual balance of payments, international systems such as the
                    IMF and others. The old fixed-rate regime had been done away with and the new
                    regime of floating rates at that time was not highly controversial. It hadn't
                    had a chance to develop and show some of the problems that we now face. We were
                    four years past from the first oil shock and only on the edge of the second one.
                    At the time the effects of the first oil shock had largely been absorbed. The
                    second one proved much more damaging but that was still in the future.</p>
                <p>Q: Being the University of Wisconsin as with the University of California one
                    always thinks of a campus politics. Did they intrude at all or was that
                    just...?</p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>LORE: No, in those years, '78-'79 the campus was very peaceful. I only remember
                    two demonstrations. One demonstration was by Iranian students against the Shah.
                    This was at the time when that movement was beginning. The other was a sham
                    demonstration to change the name of the University of Wisconsin to the
                    “University of New Jersey” so that Wisconsin would, for the first time, gain
                    respect as “an elite Eastern establishment.” This gives you some of the idea of
                    the depth of passion among students at that time. The reverberations of the
                    Vietnam war had pretty well settled out and students were very much concerned
                    with their own education, with getting a job. This largely still continues
                    today.</p>

                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>LORE: In the mid '70s during the Ford administration when Kissinger was Secretary
                    of State, there was a big push to try to avoid the emergence of quote, other
                    OPEC's, unquote. So the U.S. suddenly became very interested in developing and
                    joining international commodity arrangements and agreements to guarantee access
                    to important raw materials, particularly those that were deemed strategic, such
                    as rubber, tin, what have you. We wanted to be inside the tent with the
                    producers, so that unhappiness about price levels or about movements in the
                    international commodity prices could be discussed in a forum where we would have
                    a voice and a vote. So in those years the commodity division of the State
                    Department was a busy place and people were running off negotiating all kinds of
                    commodity agreements. This was part of the so-called North-South Dialogue of the
                    time. By the time I came into EB it was certainly the most lively part of the
                    Dialogue from the U.S. point of view.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you explain what the North-South problem was as seen
                        ithose days?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORE: The South - the developing countries were essentially demanding that the
                    global division of income be redistributed by government fiat to provide more
                    income and revenues to the developing countries, most of which were newly
                    independent countries. Simple as that. From this, the industrialized countries
                    extracted the theme of commodity pricing. Our focus was stabilization of
                    commodity prices; we agreed that such stabilization could be useful for
                    producing countries. They could plan and develop more effectively if they had
                    some idea of a buffer and of a low point and high point beyond which these
                    prices wouldn't move. We could live with that.</p>
                <p>The idea was that, if you ran the models, this would probably not mean higher
                    prices to American consumers over time. In fact, for some commodities like
                    coffee it could avoid sudden run ups in prices after a drought, say, because
                    supplies could be released from the buffer stock. By the same token, the buffer
                    stock could acquire supplies at times of overproduction, keeping prices at an
                    economically sustainable level and permitting producers to continue to plant
                    trees and renew investment to keep production from becoming unduly depressed.
                    However, the developing countries looked as commodities as a different issue.
                    They wanted commodity prices increased above market rates as a kind of a hidden
                    aid program to the South. There were other activities in the North-South
                    dialogue, other areas of discussion such as investment, shipping and so on. But
                    resource pricing was the most actively discussed and the one where the South
                    found the North most ready to talk because of the OPEC scare.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LORE: The head of the office during my time was John Ferriter. But in an issue
                    like this, really State was just one among several players. The Treasury
                    Department was very active, as was Commerce to some degree. Those were the major
                    actors.</p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find yourself with State taking a different
                        positiooften on commodity problems than, say, Treasury?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORE: By the time I came into the office the policy had evolved. When it first
                    began in the Kissinger period I think that there was probably a certain implicit
                    acceptance in the State Department that some additional diversion of revenue to
                    commodity producers could be justified for geopolitical reasons and to preserve
                    our access to vital materials. You have to remember, it was deep in the Cold
                    War; this was not a completely economic question. As time went by, as the
                    demands of the producer countries often became more egregious, the U.S.
                    administration, the Carter administration, became more conservative in the way
                    it looked at these questions. Treasury gained dominance in the process.
                    Therefore we moved to a position of willingness to participate in commodity
                    arrangements, but only if they could be justified on the basis of market
                    fundamentals. In reaction, the producer countries obviously lost some interest
                    in the exercise - as they realized that commodity agreements were not going to
                    be the money pots that they had hoped for.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LORE: For the first 18 months or so, I worked mostly on the Common Fund for
                    Commodities, one of the ideas that grew out of the North-South dialogue. The
                    Common Fund was to be an umbrella financing facility for the various individual
                    commodity agreements. It would also have a so-called second window that would
                    provide certain kinds of technical assistance to particular organizations in
                    some commodities where market stabilization wasn't deemed to be an issue but
                    where we would want to help make these producers more competitive. Examples are
                    hard fibers, soft fibers such as jute, certain other kinds of commodities,
                    bananas, things like that.</p>
                <p>Eventually, around 1980 or 81, there was a big negotiation in Geneva. I spent
                    many weekends in Geneva hotel rooms. As that played its way out to a final
                    agreement, the common fund was born. It proved to be stillborn; the final
                    negotiated product didn't hold much interest for anyone, but at the time, it was
                    the major accomplishment of the North-South dialogue. After the common fund had
                    been negotiated I moved over to what I found the most interesting assignment in
                    that office and that was to be the desk officer for sugar and also for fibers,
                    hard and soft fibers. Most of my time was spent on sugar policy. By the early
                    '80s the world price of sugar had fallen precipitously. There was a strong
                    movement for protection by U.S. sugar producers, who are very powerful

                </p>
                <p>LORE: That's right. In order to get yellow dog Democrat votes for the first
                    Reagan budget, which you remember was the major objective of the incoming
                    administration in early 1981, the Reagan administration and David Stockman
                    specifically sold the farm on sugar price supports. That is, the administration
                    essentially agreed to guarantee a level of support to domestic producers if
                    prices fell below a certain point. At the same time, the administration did not
                    allocate any budget monies to do this. The inevitable result was very tight
                    sugar quotas to control the price in the United States to make sure that there
                    never was a point where the U.S. sugar producers would turn that sugar over to
                    the federal government.</p>
                <p>This became a very important international issue with the sugar producing
                    countries. It introduced me to the joys and headaches of administering, along
                    with the Department of Agriculture, a sugar quota system. The issues were very
                    interesting and very politically charged. They coincided with a renegotiation of
                    the International Sugar Agreement, taking me frequently back to London and
                    Geneva frequently, which wasn't completely objectionable. So that was a very
                    interesting time, both because of the domestic support program and the
                    international quotas that came as a natural corollary and because of the
                    attempts by the U.S. to fashion a new sugar agreement which would help our
                    domestic situation.</p>

                    and talk, but not very much.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the Philippines? Were they a problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>LORE: No, the Philippines were quite happy with our going back to a quota system.
                    The quota system was set up on the basis of historical trade, historical exports
                    of sugar to the United States. Well, the Philippines had been a large sugar
                    supplier for many years so their historical record was very high and their quota
                    thus was quite high. They did as well if not better. Of course, these countries
                    were selling their sugar into an artificially inflated U.S. market and they made
                    a killing on the profit. So some countries like the Philippines, like Brazil,
                    made ritual criticisms of the quota system but in fact they were quite happy
                    with it. The Dominican Republic was another one. Some newer producers who didn't
                    have that historical record and also sometimes were more efficient producers
                    such as Australia, were very unhappy with it.</p>
                <p>Q: Did the politics sort of intrude down? I mean, somebody from above would say,
                    “Get off the back of the Australians” or something like that?</p>
                <p>LORE: No. There were two places that politics played a role. One was the case of
                    Nicaragua where the Reagan administration was actively trying to undermine the
                    Sandinista government at that time and wished to deny Nicaragua its quota. We in
                    the EB bureau argued against that because we wanted the credibility of the
                    system to remain untarnished. It was a GATT General Agreement on Tariffs and
                    Trade)-based formula. The GATT prescribed that if you're going to have quotas
                    they have to be implemented on a nondiscriminatory basis. That was the reason
                    for our using an historical formula. But in this case, we were saying “Well, we
                    know what we said and it applies to everyone else, but Nicaragua doesn't get a
                    quota.” The Right wing of the Republican party as well as powerful people in the
                    White House and elsewhere at that time felt that this was disguised foreign aid
                    to Nicaragua and the quota was, as I recall, taken away or at least reduced
                    significantly. So there was a case of politics, but it wasn't very controversial
                    in the United States at that time.</p>
                <p>The other case I recall was Rhodesia, which had just become Zimbabwe. Laborious
                    peace negotiations by Britain had borne fruit. It was a free black African
                    country. Because of the sanctions regime on white-run Rhodesia over the years,
                    Zimbabwe had no record at all of shipments to the United States. So we had to
                    devise a formula, a kind of a “what if.” If they had been able to ship, what
                    does history show they could have shipped? This was politically driven insofar
                    as the last thing the United States wanted to do was to punish a new independent
                    Zimbabwean state for the sins of its predecessors. But, again, I don't think it
                    was controversial with anyone particularly because everyone understood that we
                    had an anomaly there that had to be addressed. Other than that, it was pretty
                    straightforward.</p>

                        came ion economic policy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORE: Yes there was. The Carter administration as I said had already been pulling
                    back from the earlier attitude of the United States to support commodity
                    agreements. When the Reagan administration came in, it was actively antithetical
                    to them. It allowed some negotiations to continue. In the case of the
                    International Coffee Agreement, for example, one could say that politics did
                    play a certain role because some of the most fervent supporters of the Coffee
                    Agreement were the people who we wanted to support in Central America. So the
                    Central American war played a different role in the case of coffee than it did
                    in sugar. But basically the Reagan administration had little use for commodity
                    agreements which it saw as price-fixing, anti-market arrangements. Over the time
                    of the two Reagan administrations the U.S. commitment to them dissipated to the
                    point where today, I don't think we belong to any price stabilization agreements
                    at all. Since we don't belong they've collapsed.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LORE: I went to Portugal as economic counselor. I had not had a
                    Portuguese-speaking assignment since my Angola tour and of course, the degree to
                    which I spoke Portuguese as a Portuguese African desk officer. I had been
                    working in French since 1972, so I had to brush up my Portuguese at FSI.
                    However, it seemed like a natural assignment. At the time Portugal was just
                    emerging from the rocky period after the 1974 revolution. So again, it was a
                    place that people wanted to go to and where they wanted to serve.</p>

                <p>LORE: In the spring of that year of '83, Mario Soares was elected as prime
                    minister. This brought into power a moderate socialist regime, very close to the
                    United States. Soares and Frank Carlucci, who had been ambassador during the
                    worst period of the military rule after the coup, were very close personally.
                    Politically, the Portuguese situation had been resolved in a way that the United
                    States was happy with. The good guys won. But economically, the country was a
                    basket case. The difficulties following the revolution -, the loss of the
                    colonies, the return of large-scale white populations from the former colonies
                    creating a big burden for the beleaguered government in Portugal, uncertainty
                    about Portugal's reliability as a NATO ally, a drying up of investment and
                    generation of relatively large fiscal deficits and foreign debt - all created
                    considerable uncertainty.</p>
                <p>By the spring of '83, Portugal's very high international debt was viewed as
                    almost unfinancable. It was an economic basket case. There were considerable
                    worries that, whilPortugal was making strides politically, it might be
                    undermined by its severe economic problems. But four years later, when I left,
                    Portugal was a member of the EC and politically and economically it was doing
                    great. Of course, I don't take credit but again as in Morocco I went out to a
                    country which was generally thought to be in for a bad siege and in fact things
                    turned out much better that they had been expected to.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before we examine what happened, when you arrived who was
                        ouambassador and how were American relations then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORE: The ambassador was H. Allen Holmes, a career officer. It was his first
                    ambassadorship, his only one. He has been ambassador in other senses, but this
                    was his only bilateral ambassadorship. He was an excellent ambassador, a man who
                    was almost universally liked. Just a very nice and very competent man. The
                    bilateral relationship was a good one. Soares was obviously a man we knew. The
                    U.S. had helped him and Soares knew we had helped him. We'd been a major part of
                    his support in allowing the moderate socialist forces to come back. At the time
                    we were beginning Azores negotiations to renew our base rights - always the
                    major issue between the two countries. But they were being conducted in a
                    non-confrontational way, easier in many ways because we didn't have the African
                    problem that we had had in earlier years when Portuguese governments tried to
                    hold us up on African policy as a condition for continuing our base rights. So
                    the relationship was good, but there was considerable uncertainty at the
                    beginning about whether Portugal could right itself economically.</p>
                <p>Q: What happened? Again from your perspective, did the United States have any
                    hand in it? I mean, we're talking about a basket case up to an aspiring young EC
                    member in those '83 to '87 period.</p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>LORE: Well, Soares, when he ran for office, promised the Portuguese people that
                    if he was elected he would give them austerity. Portugal is one of the few
                    countries that I know where you can win on that sort of a pledge.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They're a rather dour, austere people.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORE: Well, they can be. They're very friendly, very warm people, but they have
                    this outer appearance of dourness and austerity. It's a country that had been
                    beggared by its own colonial ambitions. Portugal was at that time still really
                    more of a third world than a first world country, and most Portuguese were not
                    used to having very much. So austerity may not have held the same kind of threat
                    for them that it might have had for others. In any case, Soares appointed a
                    strong economic team, worked closely with the IMF, and ran an austerity program
                    that was very tough - as events proved, too tough. It bit harder than it needed
                    to and Soares was ousted when he ran for reelection later on.</p>
                <p>But, just to show the Portuguese didn't bear any grudges, they ousted him as
                    prime minister but, oh I guess it was a couple years later, brought him back as
                    president of Portugal. So the Portuguese people still regarded Soares with some
                    affection but he was given a good slap across the knuckles. In any case, the IMF
                    program, the austerity and the growing interest in Portugal as a base for
                    serious investment given its negotiations to join the Community all helped to
                    revive the economy.</p>
                <p>Q: What was your role as economic counselor while this was going on? Was it a
                    passive one of looking at it and saying, “Gee this is happening,” or was it one
                    where you were helping people to encourage to invest, etcetera?</p>
                <p>LORE: Somewhat like Morocco. The embassy did work hard at promoting U.S.
                    investment in Portugal. Again, because this was viewed as important,
                    particularly in a relatively small country, a few big investments make a lot of
                    difference, particularly in certain regional areas. So we did encourage
                    investment. We had some trade problems at the time. Throughout my tour we had
                    serious problems which took a lot of my time in the area of codfish and the area
                    of textiles. The numbers weren't big, but these are two products that are near
                    and dear to the Portuguese hart. They are among the world's great cod fishermen
                    and traditionally had always fished off St. George's Bank. However in the 70's,
                    we largely restricted these waters to our own fleets. Likewise, the Canadians
                    largely closed off theirs to preserve what little is left. So the Portuguese had
                    to go elsewhere. There were delicate negotiations about access to Alaskan waters
                    where we were promoting fishing activity at that time. Sensing their leverage,
                    American commercial interests drove a hard bargain. The Portuguese weren't
                    easily reconciled to traveling to such distant waters and were nervous about the
                    costs of doing so.</p>
                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>The textile area is a more familiar story. Portugal was shipping lots of cheap
                    textiles into the United States. That's something they do very well and they
                    have a highly developed textile sector. They ran afoul of some of our textile
                    limits and this required considerable discussion. It was very politically hot
                    for the Portuguese government because the northern part of the country where the
                    textiles come from is the most politically powerful part of the country.</p>
                <p>Q: How did you work this? I can see this, you and the ambassador and all caught
                    between the fact that you want to help encourage the Portuguese to have an
                    industry and textiles is a good one, yet at the same time the mills in North
                    Carolina and elsewhere aren't very happy with this. Did you find yourself with a
                    balancing act?</p>
                <p>LORE: Yes, well, the fact of the matter was a country will hit our arbitrary
                    import limits, then there is an immediate call for consultations, and these
                    consultations are inevitably highly political. They're conducted by USTR by this
                    time - and USTR didn't view itself as the protector of U.S.- Portuguese
                    relations or relations with any individual state, but rather the protector of
                    U.S. textile interests. But nevertheless at the same time they have a mandate to
                    serve the consumer as well, so they can't deliver themselves over to the kind of
                    protectionist positions that the Department of Commerce sometimes defends. When
                    you had a periodic crisis, in quotes, where we would suddenly put the breaks on
                    imports, there would be consultations, there would be a certain amount of give
                    and take, and some arrangement would be worked out.</p>
                <p>We followed the textile sector closely because of this. But we had good working
                    relationships with the Portuguese officials involved. We also had some issues on
                    shoes which were getting important at that time. There you didn't have a formal
                    quota mechanism but you also had some protectionist pressures coming out of the
                    United States. We got through it okay, but it was, I don't know if it still is,
                    but trade was during those years a significant irritant in U.S.- Portuguese
                    relations.</p>
                <p>Q: I would think that even with the USTR who has only one client and that is the
                    United States economy as opposed to the government, would be less likely to want
                    to beat up on the Portuguese than say some other countries too, in a way. Was
                    this ever a factor? I mean, the Portuguese have a good image in the United
                    States and it's not like some of these other ones where it looks like you've got
                    masses of...like the Chinese, Taiwanese, Mexican, or something, where you've got
                    masses of ill paid labor and it could flood us. I would think the Portuguese
                    would be treated somewhat differently. Was there that feeling at all?</p>
                <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                <p>LORE: Well, probably in the background there is. If our relations with the
                    country are generally good, then I think it does affect the climate of these
                    talks and perhaps the ultimate willingness of people to compromise. Obviously,
                    the State Department, which has influence, believe it or not, in these
                    discussions is going to fight harder for Portugal in those days, particularly
                    given the concerns about stability, than it might for some other country. But I
                    wouldn't exaggerate the importance of all this. It does seem to me that textile
                    policy is run on a highly micro-basis, where you're not talking about Portuguese
                    textiles per se, but you're talking about provision of men's wool overcoats,
                    say, from any source and you get into very highly differentiated markets where
                    it's difficult to show a lot of flexibility without real questions being raised
                    by U.S. producers and other foreign suppliers.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LORE: In the textile area they were okay. They tended to string things out, which
                    is a Portuguese way of doing things. They tended to complicate things. But they
                    were businesslike and usually tried to play the game the way we felt we had to
                    play it rather than excessive pleading to higher levels which some countries try
                    to do. So by and large they were cooperative negotiators and we got business
                    done. The Portuguese government is small and their depth isn't great. Their
                    ability to deal with our much more numerous delegations and far greater
                    resources was a problem off and on, but that exists in many cases.</p>
                <p>Q: What was your impression about the Portuguese attitude towards the Reagan
                    administration? I think by this time, or I'm not sure, maybe you were there at
                    the time of the bombing of Libya and all that and our action in Nicaragua and
                    Grenada and all that. Was there concern about what's the United States up to, or
                    not?</p>
                <p>LORE: The Portuguese were not in the EC yet so they didn't have those
                    constraints. They were among our most loyal allies. This was so, even in areas
                    where there was some controversy domestically about the U.S. position. For
                    example, there was only muted criticism of Grenada, despite the fact that most
                    European countries took a more forthright stand against it. The Portuguese
                    permitted aircraft to refuel and use Portuguese airspace during the Libyan
                    bombing, again something that was controversial in places like France. So no, we
                    had extensive cooperation as events later proved. In fact, although I didn't
                    know about it at the time, Oliver North had engineered shipments of some of
                    these Iran-bound missile components through Portugal, a sign that the White
                    House at the time viewed Portugal as a particularly pliable ally.</p>

                <p>Q: What about the role, again from your perspective, of' Sweden and...I'm
                    thinking that Portugal...”starling” is not the right term, but was a favorite.
                    The socialist governments in Sweden and Germany and France felt that they wanted
                    to make sure that a moderate socialist country survived so they were quite
                    active. How did you find this? Helpful, not helpful? What was the role?</p>
                <p>LORE: Very helpful. Particularly the German support.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The SPD.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORE: Yes, was very, very important. Arguably as important if nomore important
                    that the support the United States gave.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But we weren't running crosswise?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORE: No, we were working together on that. It was true that just after the
                    Portuguese revolution when Kissinger was Secretary, Kissinger had the idea of
                    just letting Portugal collapse and it would be the so-called inoculation in
                    Western Europe against any other adventures in communism. Take a small
                    relatively insignificant country, let it go communist, it collapses, it shows
                    how terrible things are, and you can use that as the bad example to the French
                    and Italian communists and others as this is what happens if you go down the
                    wrong path. Carlucci opposed that policy vigorously and won out in the internal
                    debate.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think it's one of the great moments of American post-war

                </p>
                <p>LORE: Yes, and Carlucci gets a lot of credit for basically saying, “Look we don't
                    need to give up on this country. We've got friends there, things we can do.”
                    Working with others like the Germans and so on in a small country where the
                    public was predisposed to a Western and pro-West orientation, it proved to be
                    doable.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there anything else you think we should cover at this
                        poinin Portugal?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>LORE: No, I think that my last two years particularly were heavily involved with
                    the oncoming EC membership. As Portugal negotiated its way into the EC this had
                    several ramifications. In general, however, Portugal never had much trouble in
                    the negotiations. The European Community of that time was not worried about
                    Portugal. It was too small. They were worried about Spain. But the Portuguese
                    were not controversial.. Everybody wanted Portugal and Spain to come in to
                    consolidate democracy in these two countries and the Portuguese did not offer an
                    economic threat so it was a done deal.</p>
                <p>We covered this extensively with the foreign ministry and with other parts of the
                    Portuguese government that were negotiating the accession arrangements. In the
                    final year the U.S. became concerned with possible trade effects. It had to do
                    with soybeans and it had to do with soy oil and other issues where the EC was
                    trying to extract from Portugal certain commitments to buy European rather than
                    world market which meant us. This was something we were quite concerned about
                    and made a major issue with the European Community at the time of Iberian
                    accession. So that also was a major focus of my last year in Portugal.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did it come out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORE: It came out with the usual kind of muddied compromise. But think it came
                    out with a compromise that we could live with.</p>
                <p>Q: One, we had a Secretary of State, George Schultz, who had an economic
                    background, probably the only one....the only Secretary to have this. Did you
                    feel his hand on things? Not necessarily on Portugal, but on economic
                    matters?</p>
                <p>LORE: I don't have the impression that Schultz, as it turned out, had much time
                    for international economic policy. I think he came in intending to be much more
                    active in that area. But the reality of the position of Secretary of State is
                    that you're on a plane most of the time putting out fires in places like the
                    Middle East and you really can't get into GATT renegotiation or IMF diplomacy or
                    other things that you would like to do, even absent the competition from
                    Treasury and other people who have the inside track on these issues. While we
                    appreciated having a Secretary with a feel for economic policy and economics, in
                    point of fact, most of his time had to be spent on political matters.</p>
                <p>Q: At this time looking at the accession of Portugal into the EC, I take it,
                    because of the concerns about soybeans and all there was even a greater concern
                    about the EC as being exclusionary on our part.</p>
                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>LORE: That's right. There was great concern that the EC would use Iberian
                    accession to shut the U.S. out of some quite lucrative markets. It's got to be
                    remembered that while Portugal is a small country, it was a pretty significant
                    agricultural market for U.S. goods. Portugal has to import much of its
                    agricultural consumption. So particularly in areas like wheat, corn, oils, rice,
                    Portugal is a major consumer and a very attractive market.</p>

                    to move upstairs to become executive assistant to the assistant secretary and I
                    took over as director of the office. So this is about late 1988, about the same
                    time I was promoted to the senior Foreign Service.</p>

                <p>Q: Well, let's talk about the state of Brazilian affairs in 1987.
                    Brazilian-American affairs and also the government in Brazil at that time.</p>
                <p>LORE: Starting maybe with the government; it was only two years after the
                    government had returned to civilian rule in 1985. The military had left power.
                    You had a weak civilian government with rather poor leadership, in part a
                    development of circumstances. The first civilian president of Brazil replacing
                    the military was to be Tancredo Neves, a very astute and well-regarded
                    politician, although not necessarily a modern man. In any case, no one will ever
                    know what Tancredo would have been able to do. He was elected in an indirect
                    election that was allowed by the military as they walked out the door. Then
                    Tancredo died on the eve of his inauguration, leaving the presidency with his
                    vice president Jose Sarney. Sarney was a compromise candidate who had been a
                    supporter of the military governments. He was not exactly what lots of folks had
                    in mind as the first step toward a new day.</p>
                <p>In any case, Sarney was a career politician of some ability, also a fairly well
                    regarded poet. But he was both unwilling and, I think, unable to cope with the
                    terrible financial problems that Brazil was having at that time. The country was
                    essentially broke, inflation rates were very high, something on the order of
                    2,000% a year, and because of its foreign debt it couldn't really raise money on
                    foreign markets. There were lots of big economic problems — in true Brazilian
                    style the new administration tried a number of flashy tricks to try to rectify
                    things. They only succeeded in making things worse. So this created a lot of
                    frustration. There was also at the same time a constitutional convention going
                    on in the city of Brasilia. Those in the congress were double hatted as
                    representatives to the constitutional convention. This meant the congress was
                    doing even less than it normally did and it was distracted by the needs of
                    writing this new constitution.</p>
                <p>As in many countries under authoritarian rule for a long period of time - in the
                    case of Brazil, 21 years - there were many wish lists around as to what people
                    wanted to insert in the new constitution. Many political pressures had built up
                    over that time, with attendant agendas. The new constitution quickly became
                    unwieldy.</p>
                <p>All this was going on when I came in on the desk. It contributed to rather
                    scratchy relations at the time with the United States. We were in the midst of
                    several very bad trade disputes that the Reagan administration was pressing for
                    domestic reasons. Brazil was a country that, while important enough, was not the
                    kind of country where the U.S. saw serious political costs to acting tough on
                    trade. We were rather vociferous about disputes on matters like informatics,
                    computer trade, intellectual property and other things.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: To be fair, they had a rather flourishing industry
                        didn'they...or at least serving as a center of pirated things?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>LORE: Piracy was part of the mix here. There was indeed open circulation of
                    pirated items, avoiding US copyright laws, such as computer software, music CDs,
                    movie videos, apparel, etc. There were in particular questions of copyrighted
                    software being distributed in Brazil; the big problem was more that, by
                    manufacturing its own computers, computer hardware and software, whether licit
                    or illicit and keeping ours out, Brazil was frustrating a very important part of
                    our export potential there. This was the basis for the famous “informatics”
                    dispute.</p>
                <p>We were suffering from a trade deficit internationally and with Brazil. This was
                    one of the areas where we felt we could really sell into Brazil. At the same
                    time, we pointed out that Brazil was hampering its own economic and industrial
                    development because its protected production of home-grown computers and
                    software was mot really world competitive without this kind of protection at the
                    border. On the other hand, there was a feeling on the Brazilian side that they
                    had overcome their military dictatorship, that their new civilian government was
                    struggling and the United States, far from helping, was in fact looking for ways
                    to be hurtful. I don't think that was fair, but I think that was part of the
                    emotion that was around at that time.</p>
                <p>Q: Did Brazil have laws in place at this point, sort of, “We can do everything on
                    our own” and trying to keep foreign goods out and that they would sort of
                    produce everything themselves?</p>
                <p>LORE: Yes, they had strong national industrial policies, infant industry policies
                    which had begun in the 1950s and were expanded by the military government. These
                    policies may have made some sense in certain industries at a certain time, the
                    automotive industry in the 50's, for example. But they had long outlived their
                    usefulness. In addition, they had extended into areas such as computers which
                    were not really appropriate for that kind of national policy. The difficulty in
                    these matters, of course, is that the louder the United States yells about these
                    things, the more the other government will use that opposition to rally its
                    population against foreign protests. There was a latent suspicion in Brazil -
                    which I think has now largely disappeared - that U.S. industry wanted to come
                    down and basically take over Brazilian industry and markets and to hamper
                    Brazilian development in the interest of exporting into a big market.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LORE: Yes. Brazilians did not recognize patents opharmaceuticals. This was a big
                    issue and remained one for some years.</p>
                <p>Q: If I recall too, it wasn't just Brazil but there was a spillover into...Brazil
                    was surrounded by...I mean, most Latin American countries...and the borders were
                    kind of... I mean smuggling was a pretty big business, wasn't it?</p>
                <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                <p>LORE: Well, yes. It wasn't so much smuggling but Argentina also had counterfeit
                    pharmaceuticals and didn't recognize patents on pharmaceuticals - in fact, does
                    not to this day. It's a remaining issue for us with Argentina. But I think that
                    any time you have a large country and a major trader which follows practices
                    which are egregious in the trade area and we don't have overwhelming political
                    military, geopolitical stakes in that country - at that moment, you have a
                    recipe for a hard line U.S. stance. The U.S. bureaucracy believes strongly that
                    to ignore infractions from one direction makes it very difficult for us to crack
                    the whip with others. So it's not surprising in terms of our own politics and
                    enforcement of our own worldwide interest that we went after the Brazilians.</p>

                <p>LORE: The Trade Representative's office at that time was cooperative with the
                    State Department. There was not much distance between the State Department and
                    USTR in terms of the strategy or the tactics of pursing Brazil on these
                    questions. There would be occasional differences and marginal differences on the
                    operational side. USTR then and now doesn't have the horses to do all the work.
                    They need to work cooperatively with State and Commerce, particularly if the
                    U.S. was to be effective. I think the teamwork was pretty good in those
                    years.</p>
                <p>Q: Well, let's stick to the economic side which in many ways was the name of the
                    game, wasn't it? We'll move to the other side, but Chile had the Chicago Boys
                    following...Chilean economists who had been trained in the University of
                    Chicago, rather conservative economics, seemed to be working quite well. I was
                    wondering whether there was anything the equivalent in Brazil or were we giving
                    advisors or something to try to move their economy out of the mess it had gotten
                    into?</p>
                <p>LORE: No, Brazilians are rather stubborn in these areas. Brazil sees itself as a
                    large country with educated people and with its own way of doing things. They
                    don't take advice easily from outsiders, particularly in the economic and
                    financial areas. Nor would we, to be fair. They had very qualified economists.
                    They had people who had studied in the States who could measure up to the best
                    you would find internationally. But I think that the politics of the country
                    combined with weak leadership did create situations where the Brazilian
                    government tried to have it both ways - opting for easy fixes rather than taking
                    hard steps towards reforming its own practices, particularly a tendency towards
                    fiscal deficits. Admittedly, this is a painful thing to do. The budget deficit,
                    both federal and state, were way out of line and getting worse and were an
                    engine for continued and growing inflation. The problem persists to the
                    present.</p>
                <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                <p>Brazil would not take advice from the IMF and avoided an IMF program feeling
                    again that it was different and it didn't need that kind of help. The nadir of
                    this whole period was the so-called Cruzado Plan in the mid-80's which was very,
                    very popular and very, very irresponsible... The Cruzado Plan gave Sarney a
                    great amount of support in the congress, but the plan ultimately collapsed. It
                    artificially held down prices on all sorts of goods and commodities in the
                    country for a short period of time, created a buying boom that then ran out of
                    steam. There was no incentive on the production side, so essentially goods ran
                    out and people were without goods on the shelves. This was a very serious
                    period.</p>
                <p>So you had a worrisome situation as I say, with poor leadership and frustration.
                    The successful reassertion of civilian rule, restoring prosperity, all these
                    goals seemed elusive. Brazil has always thought in big terms. You know,
                    “grandeza nacional.” Brazil had gone through a period during the military
                    dictatorship when it was growing at ten percent a year during the major economic
                    boom of the 1970s and there was an idea that this could go on forever. It
                    didn't, it collapsed after the oil shocks and the new government was not able to
                    find the key to restarting growth. Instead there was terrible inflation,
                    triggering Brazilian financial and trade measures which caused an adverse U.S.
                    government reaction and, on the part of the private sector, a lack of interest
                    in investment. Which meant that Brazil's economic relationships with the rest of
                    the world were in very poor repair.</p>
                <p>Q: I have sort of the feeling that here is the colossus of the south and the
                    colossus of the north and there really wasn't an awful lot going between
                    them.</p>
                <p>LORE: That's right. Brazilian diplomats and others would come to Washington and
                    would constantly harp on how we need a more positive agenda. What they were
                    saying was, the U.S. only talks to Brazil when it has complaints. But there
                    wasn't else to discuss at that time. In addition to the economic area we had
                    serious problems with Brazilian long range ICBM-type missile development and
                    with their nuclear program which had become a major flashpoint during the Carter
                    administration but still remained a grave concern in Washington.</p>
                <p>Q: While the Brazilians were doing this nuclear weapons missile business, usually
                    you can point to somebody, I mean, another country. Was this sort of a national
                    pride toy, or were they concerned?</p>
                <p>LORE: I think there were those in Brazil who argued the United States only really
                    pays attention if you develop nuclear arms and thus oblige attention. So this
                    was something...this was perceived as a ticket into the first world so to speak.
                    I think there was concern about the Argentine program as well. It wasn't exactly
                    an India-Pakistan situation but you did have concern that Argentina and Brazil
                    were verging on a nuclear and missile arms race.</p>
                <p>Q: We talk about we have to have a more positive attitude, more cooperation, you
                    know, but frankly, what I'm trying to say is, what was there to cooperate
                    about?</p>
                <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                <p>LORE: There wasn't a lot. We also had at that time a fair amount of finger
                    pointing on the environment. Tropical forest burning in the Amazon had just
                    become a big issue. Brazil's record was not good. It was ineffectual at trying
                    to control such burning. During the military period there had been a policy of
                    actively encouraging poor settlers from the northeast to move to the Amazon for
                    both political and demographic reasons. These people went out and burned plots
                    in order to farm. This sudden influx of poor populations into the Amazon was
                    environmentally very destructive and all of these pigeons came home to roost
                    about the time the civilians took over. On our side there was a lot of
                    gratuitous fingerprinting by U.S. Senators and others who would come down and
                    give press conferences about what Brazil should do. I've always thought that the
                    Exxon Valdez incident at that time, if it had any saving grace, was that it
                    reminded many Americans that our environmental skirts, so to speak, were not all
                    that clean.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Explain what the Exxon Valdez is.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORE: The Exxon Valdez was the oil tanker which ran aground off Alaska and
                    polluted the shores of Alaska. It was a terrible scandal that still is not
                    completely repaired today. It was a world-class environmental disaster and I
                    think it reminded many American, particularly those in Washington, that
                    environmental pollution was a problem in which nobody had a perfect record. In
                    any case, the environmental issues began to turn around. In later years, they
                    have not been as much of a problem with Brazil - largely because the Brazilians
                    have become much more environmentally conscious.</p>
                <p>With time, the trade disputes were largely resolved, or if not resolved, at least
                    worked out in a way that permitted both sides to work them in separate, more
                    technical channels. The financial problems, as financial problems tend to do,
                    were corrected because they had to be corrected. There was just ultimately no
                    choice. Brazil had to sit down with its creditors in New York and hammer out a
                    deal. Brazil's strong point here was that the size of the economy and the
                    relatively small size of the foreign debt, even though it was very large in
                    absolute terms, compared to the Brazilian economy. It wasn't hard, ultimately,
                    once you got over the political hurdles, to fashion an arrangement for a long
                    term payoff of the debt. It's going along very well and it's proved quite
                    absorbable for the Brazilians.</p>
                <p>Q: Were your bosses, assistant secretary for ARA and others saying, “For God's
                    sake, come up with something positive we can do with this.” Were you sort of
                    sitting around saying, “What can we do nice,” or something?</p>
                <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                <p>LORE: Yes, there was a lot of that and I'm not sure how much we ever did come up
                    with that was positive that made sense and that didn't cost money. But of course
                    you didn't have much hope of getting budget allocations for Brazil, particularly
                    given the generally hostile attitudes in Washington towards that country at that
                    time. There were some successful attempts at developing scientific cooperation.
                    Brazil has some world-class scientists who were educated in the United States
                    and were used to working with American scientists. That was jumping on top a
                    moving train. But beyond that, no, I think we were more or less obliged to wait
                    for a government with which we could work more easily, and wait for the
                    Brazilians to finish their constitution writing and to begin to talk seriously
                    with their creditors about their debt. Those things came about in the late '80s
                    and in 1992 a new government was elected with a modernist president, although he
                    proved a failure for other reasons. But at least he took some steps to open up
                    areas of dialogue we hadn't had in the past. That helped. That was Fernando
                    Collar.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the nuclear issue work out during your time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORE: It was always felt that you needed Brazil and Argentina to join hands and
                    jump off the cliff together, so to speak. To take the initiative jointly. When
                    both countries found themselves in the mid-'80s with new civilian governments,
                    there was an opening for creative diplomacy. Brazil and Argentina engaged in
                    some extremely creative diplomacy where the president of each country visited
                    the nuclear installations of the other creating a basis, both for their
                    bureaucracies and in popular opinion, for an arrangement. Brazil and Argentina
                    negotiated an arrangement, an international control mechanism headquartered in
                    Rio, which exists to this day.</p>
                <p>This arrangement - called ABECC - is still often cited as a possible model for
                    Pakistan and India. Both countries avoided existing international control
                    mechanisms such as the Nonproliferation Treaty to which they didn't belong. They
                    based their actions on the Treaty of Tlatelolco, the Latin American NPT. But
                    ABECC was well put together. It gained credibility from the international
                    nuclear establishment and it provided the basis for presidents Collar and Menem
                    to officially end their nuclear weapons and research programs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did we play any role in that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORE: I don't think we played much of a role in the final solution. I think in
                    years previously to that we certainly had made clear on our concern and our
                    willingness to work with the two countries... I think that probably was helpful
                    in getting across the idea that if they were willing to take the necessary steps
                    we would be supportive, as in fact we have been.</p>
                <p>Q: Was there any change when the Bush administration came in '91, as opposed to
                    the Reagan administration? They were both Republican, but I was just wondering
                    if there was a change in attitude, or Brazil just wasn't that much of a focus of
                    things?</p>
                <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                <p>LORE: Latin America still wasn't a big focus but it became more of a focus in the
                    Bush administration. The Bush administration created a program called the
                    Enterprise for the Americas which was based on private trade and investment
                    development, not on official aid flows. This was a region-wide initiative, it
                    was not taken just for Brazil. In fact, I think probably the framers, the people
                    that wrote it, largely in Treasury, didn't look at Brazil as an immediate target
                    of this program given Brazil's problems. It has, in recent years, however, been
                    very much the focus of U.S. trade and investment efforts in South America. So
                    this wasn't viewed as a Brazil program, but it was welcomed by the Latins as
                    something that made a lot of sense, that offered some carrots and didn't
                    brandish too many sticks, which the Latins are always sensitive to. The Bush
                    administration also marched smartly away from its predecessors' Central American
                    involvement. While Central America is not of any particular interest to Brazil,
                    our fixation there had been frustrating to the large countries of Latin America
                    because they felt that the U.S. was diverting all of its attention and resources
                    into small guerilla wars in tiny countries. They believed that the U.S. really
                    wasn't focusing on the major priority which was them. I think they were right.
                    The fact that this was a self-serving argument doesn't mean it was wrong.</p>
                <p>Q: Speaking of wars, did you all get involved at all during the Gulf War when
                    Iraq invaded Kuwait. I was just thinking that Brazil being a major country, did
                    we make any overtures or do anything with them to get their support.</p>
                <p>LORE: No, Brazil was not prepared to do what Menem did in Argentina and that was
                    to actually send some limited assistance to the Gulf. Brazil initially was not
                    particularly helpful on the Gulf War question. Brazil had developed very strong
                    trade relations with Iraq in the years preceding the war. Brazil had made a fair
                    amount of money by providing arms to both sides, arms and vehicles.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Iraq and Iran.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORE: To both Iraq and Iran in the first Gulf War and Brazil was uneasy about its
                    investment, particularly in Iraq where they were owed a great deal of money. So
                    I think there was initially a tendency in the Brazilian foreign ministry to look
                    for ways in which Brazil could stay on the sidelines. This was not popular in
                    Washington but it wasn't terribly important either because essentially we had
                    our coalition. We didn't really need the Brazilians we just wanted them to stay
                    out of the way. They did so, so that was pretty much it.</p>
                <p>Q: You mentioned the foreign ministry and all. Within the American Foreign
                    Service the Brazilian foreign service has a very high reputation. What was your
                    impression when you were dealing directly with it, about how it worked?</p>
                <pb facs="0067" n="Page0067"/>
                <p>LORE: Of course, the impression I have is an impression that has been developed
                    over many years. Not only from those assignments, but later on as DCM in
                    Brasilia. The Brazilian foreign service is a very able, very impressive group of
                    diplomats. Many of them are children and grandchildren of diplomats, although
                    this tendency has lessened in recent years. It's a somewhat ingrown corporation,
                    generally well off to wealthy, generally raised overseas, extremely well
                    educated, classical diplomatists. These are people who are much better than we
                    are at knowing the history and traditional practices of diplomacy. They suffer
                    from, I think, the other side of many of the same qualities. They are somewhat
                    elitist. They don't represent their country, certainly racially, or in class
                    terms as well as, say, the American Foreign Service has come to. Their focus on
                    traditional diplomatic practices and values sometimes blinds them to
                    opportunities which might depart from those practices.</p>
                <p>A case in point was when Fernando Collar, the president elected after Jose Sarney
                    finished his term. When Collar came in he unilaterally removed many trade
                    barriers and reduced trade tariffs in order to get Brazil to develop into a less
                    protectionist, more open market global trader. I think this part of Collar's
                    foreign policy was well conceived. There was a great deal of unhappiness about
                    the program in the foreign ministry; they complained that Brazil was giving away
                    quids without getting quos. In other words, if you were going to lower trade
                    barriers, you don't do it unilaterally, but you do it though negotiations.</p>
                <p>Well, I think one could argue that to provide a dramatic indication of new
                    Brazilian direction this was the right way to go and to the degree that needed
                    Brazilian investment relied on actually on getting these things done rather than
                    having years of negotiations. It was much better for Brazil to get the resulting
                    cash flows sooner rather than later. But the Itamaraty diplomats love
                    negotiations. That's their stock in trade and sometimes they're criticized for
                    losing the forest for the trees - negotiations become almost more important than
                    what you're trying to achieve at the end. In sum, Brazilian diplomats are a
                    formidable presence in their government. They have very strong support,
                    generally, within the Brazilian government and from a succession of Brazilian
                    presidents both military and civilian. They're much better placed in the power
                    struggles in Brasilia than we are in Washington. They take good advantage of
                    that.</p>
                <p>I think that many of the more reflective diplomats at Itamaraty, however,
                    recognize that there will be new demands and new things that are required as
                    Brazilian democracy consolidates itself. As its congress becomes inevitably more
                    active in foreign affairs, as other agencies of the government assert their
                    interest in foreign affairs more aggressively than they have so far,- Brazilian
                    diplomacy will have to reflect more views and inputs from outside the formal
                    foreign ministry bureaucracy. Another factor moving things in this direction is
                    the consolidation of the Mercosur free trade arrangement with its neighbors.</p>

                        Stateduring that period? Or was there really much interest?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORE: There's a great deal of interest in the United States. Relatively minor
                    developments in our politics or economics are front page there. There's a
                    fascination with the United States, a love-hate relationship, we might say, with
                    the press. The press in Brazil is very good. It's very lively, not always
                    responsible, but it has had quite a good record of muckraking over the recent
                    years to the point where they essentially got a president impeached for
                    corruption through their discoveries and hard detective work in bringing out
                    some scandals. But since Brazilian journalists are intellectuals, and I think
                    it's fair to say, tend to be more to the left, the tone of press coverage is
                    often rather cynical about the United States, that is often questioning and
                    disparaging.</p>
                <p>At the same time, the papers indulge themselves in long articles and features
                    about Disneyland and various aspects of the United States such as our music,
                    business and culture. Brazil, whether all Brazilians like it or not, is
                    submerged in North American culture. You only have to go there to see the
                    movies. listen to the radio. The character of the two populations has many
                    similarities and I think that tends to encourage a interest, a fascination with
                    American life.</p>
                <p>Q: How did you find the Brazilian embassy operated? Some embassies understand
                    where power is and worked the corridors of Congress as well as elsewhere. Did
                    the Brazilians seem to play that game or were they very active?</p>
                <p>LORE: No and I don't think they do much even to this day. They give lip service
                    to the idea of working the Congress, but I don't think they really know where to
                    start. In fact, I don't think they're alone. With the possible exception of
                    Mexico, there is no Latin American embassy which really spends any time on the
                    Hill. To be fair, it's a hard nut to crack. It's hard to get to see staffers,
                    much less members. Diplomats can't open doors in Washington the way diplomats
                    can open doors, particularly American diplomats in many other capitals. It is
                    another world on Capital Hill, as it is for us to some degree, so you can
                    imagine how our diplomatic colleagues feel coming from other countries. They are
                    often frustrated by the difficulty of finding the locus of decision making on
                    any particular issue at any particular time within the executive branch, let
                    alone the congress. I have to admit, it's often hard to figure who's making
                    decisions, if anybody.</p>

                        period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORE: From '87-92 drugs were becoming a major issue for the United States. Drugs
                    came to be proclaimed as a major if not the major American preoccupation in
                    Latin America. Brazil was not in the front lines in this area because they do
                    not have a cocaine industry. The stuff isn't grown there or processed there. But
                    Brazil, given the fact it borders on countries which do have this problem and is
                    used as a route to ship drugs to the United States and Europe, both through
                    ports and by air, became part of our drug focus.</p>
                <p>Our relations with Brazil over this have been okay, Brazilians still don't give
                    it as much importance as we think they should. They argue that it's just simply
                    not as big a problem for them as it is for us. They argue that they've got
                    populations which are undernourished, they've got regions of the country that
                    are essentially lawless, they've got environmental devastation, they've got
                    other major problems. So we have a difference in that area but it's one where
                    we've agreed to disagree and cooperation hasn't been too bad - and is
                    improving.</p>
                <p>Q: Were we keeping a...through our embassy but other means...of keeping a close
                    eye on the military during this period? To see if they were going to get restive
                    and try to move back in?</p>
                <p>LORE: There were those in Washington and in the Bureau of Inter-American Affairs
                    who felt that we should be more worried about the military. I took the position
                    that we didn't need to worry about the military. The military, in Brazil at
                    least, were exhausted. They had run the country for 21 years. They had run it
                    basically into a sandpit. They left feeling unappreciated. Their professional
                    expertise, their equipment, their doctrine was all hopelessly out of date
                    because trying to run the country had distracted them. They had no appetite at
                    all to come back in. It didn't mean that they wouldn't occasionally send a
                    message publicly or privately when they felt that the civilians were going off
                    course. But there wasn't really a saber behind that and I think that is still
                    very much true.</p>
                <p>It could come someday that you'd have a renewed threat, but it seems increasingly
                    unlikely. Latin America - certainly including Brazil - does seem to be embarked
                    on a period of sustained democratic rule. These democracies are not perfect by
                    any means, they have their weaknesses, but they're not particularly susceptible
                    to military coups. The situation in some of the smaller countries is less
                    favorable, but certainly the big countries appear to be relatively stable. One
                    has to remember that in Brazilian history, the military have only taken power
                    when they were in effect invited by civilian factions to do so. In Brazil,
                    unlike in some Latin American countries, there is not a military deus ex machina
                    that decides on its own when it might take power.</p>

                <pb facs="0070" n="Page0070"/>
                <p>LORE: In '92 I was assigned as DCM in Brasilia. It was a natural development from
                    being office director for Brazilian affairs. As these things develop, they're
                    always somewhat haphazard. The new ambassador appointed in '92 by the Bush
                    administration was Alec Watson. Watson was a Brazilianist, who had also had
                    high-level assignments in other parts of the area. He knew Brazil very well. I
                    think it's fair to say he was delighted by the chance to be ambassador to
                    Brazil. He asked me to come as his DCM. I did not know him well before then but
                    we had had some phone conversations and I guess he might have valued my recent
                    contact with the issues - he had not been working on Brazil in recent years. He
                    had himself been DCM in Brasilia some years earlier. So I think he saw some
                    value in having someone who was aware of the issues and personalities. As it
                    happened, I took the assignment, went out in the summer of '92, but Watson never
                    became ambassador. Late in the Bush administration, the Senate began to delay
                    action on presidential nominations requiring confirmation and he ran out of
                    time. The Clinton administration came in, renominated him to be ambassador to
                    Brazil, but then ran into terrible problems trying to find an assistant
                    secretary for Latin America who would be acceptable to various interest groups
                    in the United States.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Particularly Senator Helms I guess.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORE: Well, not only Helms. They first decided on a black Cuban-American, a
                    lawyer from Newark. The Clinton administration tripped over itself, as it did
                    often in those first months, by not really focusing on the fact that this guy
                    may have been a black of Cuban descent, but he wasn't one of the Miami Cubans,
                    he was a Newark Cuban and he was looked at with some suspicion. I'd hope it
                    wasn't racial, although there were some charges there was a racial component to
                    it. But certainly, he was looked at with some suspicion by the wealthy
                    Cuban-American community in Florida as someone who had been willing to travel to
                    Cuba and to meet with Castro, so he wasn't a true believer. So that nomination
                    came under fire. The administration ducked for cover, went to ground and as
                    often happens, then turned to a career diplomat who was non-controversial and
                    well liked by both sides of the aisle. The result was that Watson suddenly found
                    himself as assistant secretary for Inter-American affairs. The ambassador who
                    was there, Rick Melton, remained for an extra year. I wound up working as his
                    DCM. When Melton left, I served as charge for about seven months until the new
                    ambassador, Mel Levitsky, took over. Levitsky has also stayed on longer than he
                    intended to because of the difficulty in finding and confirming a replacement.
                    He only just left last week.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We've already talked rather extensively about the issues
                        up to '92. Was it pretty much a continuation of that? How did you find
                        Brasilia after being away for so long?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORE: I found Brasilia extraordinarily comfortable. It's very isolated, a little
                    boring and monotonous. You do not get the sense of color and excitement that you
                    do in the big cities of Brazil. On the other hand, it's a very comfortable, easy
                    place to live. A ranking officer of the American Embassy can go to three or four
                    cocktail parties a night and still be home by 8:30 in the evening because the
                    city is built for the automobile. There is a system of major roads, some of
                    which really resemble our interstate highways, connecting the city's
                    neighborhoods. So although there are more cars there now than there used to be,
                    you still get around very, very quickly. The climate is good. The housing is
                    extraordinarily good, particularly for higher-ranking people (although morale
                    has suffered in the past because lower-ranking people in the embassy lived in
                    some rather undesirable apartments). The higher-ranking people lived in southern
                    California type housing with swimming pools and extensive lawns. As for work,
                    it's an ideal place for a workaholic because there's not much to do other than
                    work on your tennis or golf game. Isolation was an issue for some; as DCM, I was
                    able to travel around the country so, unlike some of my colleagues, I was able
                    to see something of other parts of Brazil and deal with Brazilians in
                    circumstances outside the capital.</p>
                <p>I found that a major challenge of the job was to deal effectively with the
                    problems of an embassy in an isolated place with a large staff from different
                    agencies. We had a great many staff people who could not speak much Portuguese
                    and they and their families often felt estranged from their surroundings. It was
                    a community that had to rely on itself. There wasn't a greater American
                    community out there, virtually the only Americans in Brasilia are those with the
                    embassy. The other embassies were much smaller and, at the staff level, largely
                    stayed to themselves. In the Brazilian community, one has to speak Portuguese -
                    but even if you did, Brazilians in Brasilia essentially live a suburban
                    existence where they go home every night and there is not a great deal of
                    culture activity or interchange. You couldn't go downtown in the evening, for
                    example, to participate in the culture and do things that brought you into the
                    county. You went to a shopping center and you went to a movie, just like you do
                    in the U.S.</p>
                <p>All of this placed a very heavy burden on the ambassador and on the DCM and on
                    their spouses to show some leadership in creating a cohesive community where
                    people felt they had a home. It wasn't a nine to five arrangement. Several
                    evenings a week, there were various kinds of embassy community functions where
                    your presence was expected.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0072" n="Page0072"/>
                <p>LORE: Well, we still had the trade issues. After all, we still have problems with
                    Japan and the EU, so why not witBrazil? We did have quite a positive agenda, I
                    think, on the nuclear side. That was developing very nicely during my time
                    there. It had moved from becoming a negative to a positive. On drugs, as I say,
                    I think that we're working out some areas for cooperation. I spent a lot of time
                    personally on two issues where I thought that the embassy could make a big
                    difference. One was on visas, where Brazil had a much more restrictive, less
                    forthcoming visa policy for American travelers than we had for Brazilians.</p>
                <p>We took some rather tough steps on restricting Brazilians in order to create
                    pressure for change in Brazilian visa law, and we succeeded. That went through
                    just before I left. So we were able to get a much better deal on visas for our
                    citizens, which I think was important. It allowed us in turn to provide
                    Brazilians with even better visa conditions. This is something we badly needed
                    to do. Brazil is one of these countries, and there are a number of them around
                    the world now, that with some prosperity and with lower airfares and with the
                    attractiveness of the United States as a destination given our low costs for
                    lodging, car rentals, etc., we've seen an explosion in demand for American
                    visas. Our visa sections are just not equipped to deal with it. So we have to
                    find some imaginative ways to deal with that explosion rather than just adding
                    bodies to stamp visas. Rather than 20 visa officers to issue three-month visas,
                    it's a lot better over the long run to have five or six who are doing four- and
                    five-year visas. Maybe one day we can do away with the visa requirement
                    altogether.</p>
                <p>Q: Was there the problem that there was very obviously the relatively wealthy
                    traveling class and then there were the poor people who were trying to go to the
                    United States?</p>
                <p>LORE: Yes, the poor people of course ran up against the bona fides problem that
                    we're all familiar. They're almost automatically rejected because it's difficult
                    for them to establish where they get the money to make the trip to the U.S. and
                    to sustain themselves here. The rich of course get their visas long ahead of
                    time and have ways of circumventing the system - they don't have to stand on
                    line, they send a driver and all the rest. It's among the middle class that has
                    legitimate aspirations to visit Disneyland, or Disney World, where you have the
                    big problems. It was cheaper for a Brazilian family from Sao Paulo to go to
                    Orlando for a week or two weeks' vacation than to go someplace in Brazil. So it
                    wasn't unusual, it was quite credible that people would want to go to the United
                    States - but they may also be motivated by greater economic opportunities in the
                    U.S. Our visa sections are just not set up to handle timely adjudication of
                    visas for these large groups.</p>
                <pb facs="0073" n="Page0073"/>
                <p>The other area that I got into was the question of reciprocity of treatment for
                    official staffs. Our chief concern was to obtain better treatment for our people
                    in terms of their household shipments and their imports. This involved their
                    treatment by Brazilian authorities, port authorities, customs authorities and
                    the rest. These might seem to be mundane problems but they impact significantly
                    on mission morale and on our ability to attract high quality staff. We had less
                    success on the reciprocity side than on the visa side. But these were two issues
                    where I put a lot of time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Usually when you have this reciprocity problems, it
                        usually that means relations aren't very good between two countries, because
                        basically it's bureaucrats giving the other country's bureaucrats a rough
                        time. Was this it, or was this deliberate?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORE: No, I don't think it was deliberate. Much of it grew out of the fact that a
                    Brazilian diplomat who comes to Washington really is quite self-sustaining here.
                    He doesn't have to bring things from Brazil. He'll buy his Ford Taurus, he'll go
                    to the Giant. He does better than we do because he has a tax card, but even if
                    he didn't have the tax card, products here are relatively cheap and everything
                    is available. Aside from the occasional specialty item, he never has to order
                    anything from Brazil. So customs problems and import complications are simply
                    not on his scope. On the other hand, an official American in Brazil wants to
                    bring in far more - either because items are not available in Brazil or because
                    they're available but they're of inferior quality or higher price.</p>
                <p>Having to import into Brazil, one runs into all of the lingering problems of a
                    bureaucracy and a mindset that still after, despite some changes, is still
                    somewhat protectionist in nature. It tends to operate according to a system of a
                    great many highly detailed regulations which no one obeys, but foreigners -
                    particularly diplomats - have to obey because they're in a position where they
                    have to. It's not that the Brazilian authorities were necessarily harassing
                    Americans. Some smaller embassies in Brasilia, perhaps composed of less ethical
                    diplomats, will take advantage of loopholes and bring in extra cars and do other
                    kinds of things and make money. The Brazilian authorities have the constant
                    problem, as do we here in Washington, of not creating rules that give latitude
                    to those less honest embassies.</p>
                <p>So the American embassy, being the biggest and most visible, was forced to follow
                    the rules to the letter. When the Brazilian government tried to introduce
                    legislation into the congress to give us special treatment, reflecting
                    reciprocal conditions, it did not prosper. Brazilian politicians immediately
                    suffered an attack of “gringoitis” and decided that giving so-called favors to
                    American diplomats was something Brazil shouldn't do. You can't win for
                    losing.</p>
                <p>Q: You traveled around. How did you find the role of Rio and Sao Paulo
                    particularly? Were they sort of almost autonomous? Brazil, I mean, is such a big
                    country.</p>
                <pb facs="0074" n="Page0074"/>
                <p>LORE: Sao Paulo state cannot be compared to any state in the United States. Even
                    California does not loom as large in the United States, politically or
                    economically, as Sao Paulo state does in Brazil. This gives the governor a great
                    deal of power. He enjoys more power, under current arrangements, than our state
                    governors do. Sao Paulo as a state is bigger in terms in GDP and population,
                    certainly GDP, than any country in Latin America other than Mexico. It's much
                    bigger than Argentina. Sao Paulo is the engine that drives Brazil. The city is
                    sort of a combination of New York and Detroit. Rio is still the sentimental
                    capital of Brazil. It is the place that all Brazilians want to be from or want
                    to go to. But increasingly it plays second fiddle to Sao Paulo. There are
                    important businesses in Rio and probably will be for a long, long time; it is an
                    important business capital in its own right. Over time, however, it's
                    increasingly losing ground to Sao Paulo, which is the major financial and
                    industrial capital of the country. Sao Paulo state is much larger as a state and
                    has other big cities in it and other resources outside of Sao Paulo city. Rio
                    suffers somewhat for not having much of a hinterland and thus politically
                    doesn't have the same kind of clout in the federation.</p>
                <p>Q: I would think that sort of country representation-wise this would create a
                    certain amount of frustration in Brasilia. Here you are stuck up in the
                    hinterland and dealing with things where the engine and all and the consul
                    general is sort of right in the middle of it. It's always been considered the
                    equivalent to being an ambassadorial post. Did this cause any problem?</p>
                <p>LORE: It may be considered that by the consuls general in Sao Paulo,I'm not sure
                    it's considered that by his/her supervisors in Brasilia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I understand what you mean, but as far as posting goes,
                        it'considered a very prestigious posting.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORE: Our last consul general there was Melissa Wells who had been ambassador to
                    several countries. We do send former and future ambassadors to Sao Paulo. But
                    it's not the embassy. It does not deal with the foreign ministry. It is not
                    where the important conversations take place between presidents, between
                    ministers of the two governments and so the opportunity for influencing country
                    to county relations is quite limited. You have a big stage, you get to meet a
                    lot of businesspeople, but I think your geopolitical influence is severely
                    limited.</p>
                <p>The Rio consulate general has shrunk in size and is being consciously downsized
                    and downgraded in terms of the rank of the consul general. It's not beyond
                    imagining that some day we might not even have a post in Rio. Probably it's
                    going to be a long time yet. But in fact we don't maintain anything like the
                    staff we used to. In these days the push is on to close consulates and the fact
                    that we had four - plus several consular agencies - during my time in Brasilia
                    was remarkable. There are not too many countries in the world where we still
                    maintain that many consulates. We've closed one of them so now we only have
                    three, and I wouldn't give a lot of hope for Recife which is the number three,
                    and as I say, even Rio might go someday.</p>
                <pb facs="0075" n="Page0075"/>
                <p>Q: We were talking about the Brazilian embassy and its access to Congress, which
                    was almost nil.. You were mentioning that putting down the gringos is apparently
                    a good solid Brazilian game. How about our access and ability to work in the
                    corridors of whatever pass for the Brazilian “Hill?”</p>
                <p>LORE: I think we did quite well in that area on the pharmaceutical intellectual
                    property issue, where legislation was needed. There was a visa bill that we got
                    through, and a number of other areas where we could be useful. An embassy always
                    has to be careful how much visibility it has in the host country's legislative
                    corridors - particularly an American embassy in a Latin American country. But
                    within those constraints I think we have been fairly effective. The potential
                    for effective legislative diplomacy is limited in Brazil because the Brazilian
                    congress, while improving, still is not a strong branch of government.</p>
                <p>There are too many Brazilian congressmen and senators who are exceedingly
                    provincial, who are corrupt, who do not, because of the Brazilian electoral
                    system, always represent the interests of their district in the way that
                    American congressmen would. Their political parties are weak; it's hard to lobby
                    where party discipline is not strong. But on specific issues with specific
                    people, usually legislators who have taken the trouble to become knowledgeable
                    in certain areas like intellectual property, an embassy can have some
                    effect.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LORE: Very good, very open. Brasilia helps. It is a place where obviously, people
                    are very busy, ministers are very busy but their lives are eased by the fact
                    that they're living in an administrative capital far from the distractions of
                    Rio and Sao Paulo. There's better access to high levels of the Brazilian
                    government in a place like Brasilia than there would be in a normal city where
                    the government was spread around more and it was more difficult to get to
                    people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there anything else you think we should cover in this
                        period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORE: No, I think we've pretty much covered it. I was charge for a period of
                    time. The Clinton administration was fairly new in office, so during my last two
                    years in Brasilia - first as charge and then with Ambassador Levitsky - we had a
                    succession of high level visits from virtually everybody you can think of
                    starting with Al Gore, when I was charge. Gore was in for an overnight. It
                    wasn't even overnight. He came in at about five o'clock in the evening and left
                    at about midnight in Brasilia. We had a number of cabinet members and the USTR.
                    Secretary of Commerce Ron Brown was in and out several times since Brazil was
                    given much more importance by the incoming Clinton administration as one of the
                    “Major Emerging Market.”</p>
                <pb facs="0076" n="Page0076"/>
                <p>The Clinton administration created this concept of ten large emerging markets.
                    This displaced the Enterprise for the Americas in a way, because it really
                    focused on ten markets where we were to apply our trade development efforts,
                    Brazil being one of them. So we saw an awful lot of people like Ron Brown.
                    Madeline Albright came when I was charge and she was UN ambassador. We had
                    Secretary of Defense Bill Perry, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Shalikashvili,
                    and so on and so on. All of which was very good in terms of developing more of a
                    dialogue at high levels with the Brazilian authorities, particularly on global
                    issues and problems.</p>
                <p>Q: So in many ways the Clinton administration, because of its trade
                    emphasis...Clinton was elected on the slogan “it's the economy.” So this in a
                    way by gravity pushed it towards Brazil as being a big market.</p>
                <p>LORE: That's right. The Clinton administration had and continues to have a strong
                    emphasis on promoting foreign business overseas. The trade and investment
                    potential for Brazil is enormous and that was recognized. In 1994, about six to
                    eight months before I left Brasilia, Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso
                    initiated the Plano Real, which was a bold but successful and very well executed
                    attempt to stop inflation in Brazil and to provide a basis for growth and global
                    engagement. The plan worked well, it got Cardoso elected as president later in
                    1994. Janet Reno came down on New Years Eve, 1994 to attend the inauguration the
                    next day.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: She's our attorney general.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORE: Yes. Anyway, Cardoso went on to preside over a rather startlingly
                    successful economic plan called the “Plano Real,” which he had initiated while
                    still Finance Minister. It both stopped inflation and greatly helped the poorer
                    classes of Brazil, inflation being the cruelest tax, as they said. All of this
                    provided a good basis for the Clinton administration to push even harder the
                    idea of engagement with Brazil on the economic side. Therefore, my Brasilia tour
                    ended on a high note as we were entering into a period of really more active
                    engagement with the Brazilians. Much of that engagement is in the private
                    sector, not government-to-government, but that's probably as it should be.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But you helped prepare the groundwork.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORE: Well, governments can help prepare groundwork and then they can stay out of
                    the way. Sometimes it's very difficult to stay out of the way. So I left Brazil
                    in the summer of 1995. I think we've covered pretty much the major developments
                    during my time as DCM.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, in '95 where did you go?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0077" n="Page0077"/>
                <p>LORE: In '95 I wanted to do something different. I had had what I felt was the
                    large and exciting managerial challenge of being DCM of a very big embassy. I
                    wanted to try something different. Many of us, of course, were reading tea
                    leaves at the time and seeing that you could not count on an endless career in
                    the Foreign Service and you ought to start thinking about other things. For
                    these reasons I was attracted by an opportunity to go to the Naval War College
                    in Newport, Rhode Island and teach strategy and policy, a course which used
                    historical case studies of the use of power. This was quite a departure,
                    something I had never done before, and I enjoyed it very much.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You did it from '95-'97 or so?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORE: I did it for two years, '95 to '97. I came home to NortherVirginia in the
                    summer of '97.</p>
                <p>Q: How did you find the War College? Sometimes the Navy has two faces. One is
                    it's sometimes considered by people in the Foreign Service to be the most...the
                    less internationally sophisticated, yet it's all over the world. But it seems to
                    be more into itself than, than say, the Army, which is used to going out and
                    sitting out in foreign soils so in their training they seem to be much more, in
                    our perspective, outward looking. How did you find the War College?</p>
                <p>LORE: The U.S. Navy is a different culture. It's often been remarked upon. It is
                    more insular than the other services; it is a culture which reminded me in some
                    ways of the Foreign Service. For example, there used to be idea in the State
                    Department if you wanted to get promoted you had to be overseas. That still
                    exists in the Navy. The only way to get promoted is it you're driving ships.
                    Sitting in an office doesn't do it. That's why there are relatively few Navy
                    officers in Washington, why the Navy's presence in Washington is nowhere near
                    what the other services' have. The Naval War College suffers from this - it has
                    traditionally had difficulty in getting some of the Navy's top officers to take
                    a year off and sit on dry land even if at the edge of the ocean, and study
                    books. This is true despite the fact that the Naval War College was the first of
                    the service war colleges.</p>

                <p>LORE: Albert Thayer Mahan, a great and prestigious history, a great intellectual
                    tradition. The college today is fairly said to be the most rigorous of the
                    service colleges and probably of all the war colleges. Students there don't take
                    trips. They don't have recreational unit athletics and that kind of thing. It's
                    very much nose to the grindstone, writing papers and doing some pretty demanding
                    graduate-level work. The college offers its students a master's for their year's
                    work; it was the only war college to do so until the National War College in
                    Washington began to do so. The college is a proud and traditionalist institution
                    mirroring the service it represents.</p>
                <pb facs="0078" n="Page0078"/>
                <p>I found it very stimulating to work in the department of strategy and policy.
                    This was a department created by Stansfield Turner, Admiral Turner, who was
                    president of the Naval War College in the, I think, the Ford administration.
                    This would have been before he came to Washington as the director of the CIA
                    under Carter. Turner had created this course to look at historical uses of power
                    to achieve national goals. It was stimulated by the Vietnam experience. Vietnam
                    was too sore a subject in those years to discuss directly, you couldn't get
                    people sitting in a classroom talking academically about the whys and wherefores
                    of our policy in Vietnam when they had just been over there and had had buddies
                    who died. So the ancient Greeks served as a substitute. There was intense study
                    of Thucydides and of the Athens-Sparta wars, and from this stemmed a whole
                    curriculum of also looking at other major wars. Examples are the Napoleonic
                    wars, Bismarck's wars, the First and Second World Wars, the Russo-Japanese War,
                    and so on. They're even now beginning to develop the Gulf War as a separate case
                    study.</p>
                <p>This is very interesting because you play with history in a way that historians
                    are not allowed to, to try to imagine or at least discuss what the outcomes of
                    alternative strategies might have been. Whether these alternatives might have
                    more successfully achieved policies, or whether the policies themselves made any
                    sense. Of course, there are no real answers - the course is about raising
                    questions. All of this, of course, pointed towards Vietnam - and Vietnam itself
                    was eventually incorporated as a two-week unit.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would have thought in a way it was almost pernicious
                        looking at Thucydides and all the Athens-Sparta thing because you end up
                        with Syracuse and what is it, having done all that men can do, they could do
                        no more, or something like that, and you have the Athenian collapsing and
                        going into the mines of Syracuse as prisoners. Which all seem to imply that
                        a state like the Soviet Union could outlast and be tougher than a more open
                        society such as Athens. Was this a lesson that was coming out or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORE: Well, you could get some pretty good discussions going on “Is Athens really
                    the United States and is Sparta really the Soviet Union?” You could make a
                    pretty good case that in fact it's the opposite. Obviously you can't stretch
                    these parallels all the way and they're going to be inexact either way. We're
                    all dazzled by the great art and architecture and theater, the attainments, the
                    cultural, intellectual attainments of ancient Greece, by which we mean Athens.
                    But Athens was an exceedingly cruel and dictatorial ruler of its various
                    colonies.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the island that got wiped out because they
                        wouldn't join?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0079" n="Page0079"/>
                <p>LORE: Milos. Some horrible things are recounted in Thucydides which sometimes
                    recall the Nazi death camps or Russian tanks rolling in Prague. You can make a
                    case that really Athens may be more analogous with the Soviet Union particularly
                    in its foreign relations. Sparta, while an uncultured warrior society, was
                    surprising flexible and generous with the members of its coalition. It needed to
                    be; it didn't have the same kind of control over its allies and it had to
                    negotiate with them. It operated in a NATO-like environment. So you can argue
                    this different ways and the important thing is not to draw an exact parallel
                    with Athens, i.e. “Is North America Sparta - is the Soviet Union?” The
                    interesting point is that certain characteristics of the Athenians and the way
                    they went about their business may well have prevented them from operating
                    effective strategies to achieve their political goals.</p>
                <p>What you're trying to get across to the students is really not history, although
                    you have to absorb a lot of history to have the discussion. It's more “Let's
                    think about what works and what doesn't” and “How do you think about
                    constraints, how do you assess your strengths and weaknesses, how do you assess
                    the strengths and weaknesses of the others, how cold can you be about it?” and
                    if Athens had done that, for example, they would have realized that they had
                    real problems with their coalition because of the way they had treated its
                    members in the past</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find it was easy to get the Naval officers
                        intellectuallengaged?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORE: Most of them. Like any group of middle Americans you tend to get people who
                    are very technically advanced in their particular specialties. You would have
                    some people who really resisted the course and were somewhat intimidated by it.
                    But I would say that, by and large, most of the officers, even those who perhaps
                    were uncomfortable with abstract concepts and lacked confidence in discussing
                    them nonetheless were greatly stimulated by the course. It was a real challenge
                    to encourage them while also forcing them to think through their ideas. To not
                    discourage them, but at the same time to force them to be intellectually
                    vigorous. I think most of them took to it quite well. They're military officers,
                    they know that they have to take to it if they want to get through that year.
                    Most officers regarded the four months of strategy and policy as the highlight
                    of their time at the War College. The other two courses that they took, one in
                    national security policy and one in joint operations were more traditional War
                    College fare. The students liked them, but they weren't anywhere near as
                    popular.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you think they came out of it with a greater
                        appreciation othe diplomatic arm of the United States?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0080" n="Page0080"/>
                <p>LORE: There was one other FSO who was there on the faculty and the two of us
                    viewed educating these military officers about the State Department and foreign
                    service as among the most important contributions we could make. Most of the
                    officers we came in contact with were middle grade, men and women in their 30's,
                    maybe early 40's. They're at the point in their careers where they step beyond
                    their technical specialties and begin to draw assignments in joint commands with
                    other services, civilian agencies, sometimes nationals of other countries. I put
                    together and taught a course on how the foreign affairs bureaucracy works in
                    Washington, at the working level. How the sausage is prepared. I didn't do much
                    with organization charts but rather used case studies and guest speakers to
                    explore how things actually work or don't work when you're trying to implement
                    national policy in the foreign affairs area.</p>
                <p>I think that, just through my presence and by the social interaction that you
                    have with the students, they were able to get a much better idea of who we were
                    and what we do. I enjoyed that. I have written both in the Foreign Service
                    Journal and in Government Executive about my feeling that there should be a
                    greater outreach from the State Department to these service war colleges, i.e.
                    sending more students and more faculty from the foreign service in order to
                    better understand the military mindset and what military criteria are. I think
                    the uniformed military are much more curious about us and learn much more about
                    us than we deign to learn about them, and I think that's unfortunate.</p>
                <p>Q: I'm 70 years old and I come from a generation that all my cohort almost to a
                    man, and the word “man” is operative, had...I had my four years in the military
                    as an enlisted man. But almost all of us had a good solid dose of military
                    service so that like it or lump it, we had a feel for the military which I don't
                    think the new generation has.</p>
                <p>LORE: We're not going to bring back the draft, so at least maybe you try to get
                    FSO's and other foreign affairs operators in closer touch with military
                    counterparts before you actually have an evacuation or a Bosnia or other things
                    where you've got to work together. It seems to me you work much more smoothly
                    together in times of crisis if there's already been this familiarization in a
                    non pressure and academic atmosphere. But in these days of budget limitations
                    and downsizing, the general response at FSI and elsewhere in State is “We just
                    don't have the money for that.”</p>
