                <p>CHARLES K. JOHNSON</p>
                <p>Interviewed by: Jay P. Moffat</p>
                <p>Initial interview date: 2000</p>
                <p>Copyright 2001 ADST</p>
                <p>Q: A little background into your early life and how you wound up in the
                    Department of State anForeign Service.</p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Well, the inspiration for getting into the Foreign Service came from one
                    or two professors at Stanford University where I was an undergraduate. I started
                    at UCLA (University of California at Los Angeles) for two years, then
                    transferred to Stanford. We had a very active International Relations program
                    there which was rather unusual in the West at that particular time, which was
                    the late forties. But Graham Stuart was the name of the professor. He was an
                    occasional consultant with the State Department and he tried to spark interest
                    among his students in seeking careers in Washington. At that particular time,
                    most students attending Stanford were from western states. Somewhat later, it
                    became a magnet for students from all over the country, but at that time it was
                    largely west of the Rockies. Stuart strongly felt that the west was
                    underrepresented in the foreign service affairs agencies here in Washington. So
                    he had an active program to encourage people in his classes to take the Foreign
                    Service written test. He virtually marched us up to the Regional Civil Service
                    Office in Oakland, California, some 50 miles away, and confronted us with this
                    three day test. So I took it just because I wasn't sure what I wanted to do and
                    was happily surprised when I passed. After obtaining my masters degree, I headed
                    home to wait for the summons to come back to DC and take the orals.</p>
                <p>So the next step was a summons to Washington for an oral interview by this August
                    Foreign Service board. In those days, a candidate paid his own way back to
                    Washington, DC. Since relatively few passed the oral test, it was a throw of the
                    dice in which you might lose quite a bit financially. Happily, I passed the test
                    but then came a new obstacle. The State Department had no funds to hire new
                    FSOs. And so we were all tossed into the freezer for two or three years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you specify the dates?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>JOHNSON: I think this must have been around 1950. I returned to California,
                    worked for my dad, who was a banker, for a while, and then decided to return to
                    Washington and see what other kind of a job I could find. With the help of the
                    State Department, I found a job in what is now known as INR, I think it was just
                    called R at that time. Instead of the three year wait, as forecast by the
                    Foreign Service, the call to join the ranks and be assigned abroad came just
                    after I settled into the “R” area job. A more significant factor was that I had
                    just met my future wife and was not anxious to go abroad. The result was that I
                    turned down the appointment. There were no hard feelings and I continued to work
                    in the intelligence research area; made a switch in 1954 and entered the realm
                    of what was then called the Bureau of German Affairs. It was a bureau co-equal
                    with the Bureau of European Affairs, a big operation because we had taken over
                    the responsibility for Germany in 1949 from the military and there were
                    extensive reserved powers that we exercised in 1949-1955. Our mission in Bonn
                    was a High Commission, not an embassy. Our reserved powers under the 1949
                    Occupation Statute meant a lot of backstopping in Washington. A lot of positions
                    from the Army actually were transferred over to this bureau in order to
                    administer all of the many parts of this arrangement. It was particularly
                    complicated in the economic field. But I had a special slot in that office which
                    many people did not envy. When I wanted to make a transfer, the only position
                    open was as assistant to the special assistant to the director. The incumbent
                    was none other than the sister of the Secretary of State, Eleanor Lansing
                    Dulles. I remember my first meeting with her - set up so she could look me over
                    - she was on the phone with her back to me. As she finished her conversation,
                    she wheeled around and I thought “My God, it's John Foster Dulles sitting
                    there.” The family resemblance was startling. I was so distracted that I doubt
                    that I came off as very intelligent in the rest of the interview. But she
                    decided I was alive and kicking and took me on.</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>There began an interesting two years, an introduction to something that was quite
                    different for me. This was an operational office concerned with a lot of current
                    issues. Eleanor Dulles had responsibility for Berlin affairs at that time, but
                    she also took over certain programs which flowered during my time there, that
                    had to do with sending food aid and assistance to students in what was then
                    called the East (or Soviet) Zone of Germany, as well as promoting East-West
                    contacts through travel and meetings. In retrospect, one could fairly say that
                    these programs anticipated on a much smaller scale of course what was to become
                    known as “Ostpolitik” under Willy Brandt. She carved out a fairly formidable
                    niche for herself. This was at a time when we were still giving some economic
                    assistance to West Germany out of foreign aid appropriations [FOA]. With the
                    increasing prosperity of West Germany, it was becoming difficult to get any
                    bureaucratic sympathy for United States dollars going to Berlin, since the
                    feeling was the Federal Republic could certainly take care of this. But there
                    was a political justification for our being there and indicating to the
                    Berliners that the United States, as well as the United Kingdom and the French,
                    were behind them. So it was a politically economic program of assistance; we
                    gave funds to equity financing programs; we helped finance a stockpile which was
                    to be used in case there were further problems similar to the blockade of 1948-
                    49. At one point Mrs. Dulles got the idea that Berlin needed a Congress Hall. We
                    managed to squeeze out of FOA two or three million dollars which went to
                    construct a Congress Hall on the banks of the Spree River in Berlin. There were
                    a lot of public relations type projects that she promoted. She went to Berlin at
                    least two or three times a year.</p>
                <p>Q: In all of this, the question of her relationships with the Washington
                    bureaucracy and of course the people in the field is interesting. Would you be
                    able to characterize for us how she fitted into the government effort?</p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Everyone thought she had the Secretary of State in her pocket and that
                    she was whispering things in his ear when she occasionally rode to work with him
                    from his home in Georgetown. She told me a couple of times, “You know, I don't
                    think he has paid a bit of attention to me. I try to tell him something about
                    Berlin but I don't think he hears any of it.” Perhaps she was just trying to
                    play that down but it was widely perceived that she was a very formidable lady.
                    Nobody was anxious to go up against her in a bureaucratic fight, and there were
                    a hell of a lot of them, because we were always fighting with FOA over funds. We
                    were often crossing swords with the embassy in Bonn and mission in Berlin
                    because they didn't ask for enough funds for Berlin. In the German Bureau, we
                    had to base our requests to the aid agency on the basis of recommendations from
                    the field. It was widely thought that Eleanor would time her visits to the two
                    posts so that she could go over there and prompt them on how they should write
                    their cables; she already knew exactly what she wanted to go in for. But in any
                    event, she did have a lot of elbow strength in the bureaucracy. I think people
                    attributed more than was actually there. In any event, people didn't want to
                    tangle with her and so she usually managed to get her way. She was also a very
                    persistent woman, very persuasive, sharp minded, and very intelligent. She also
                    had another formidable relative in the family who was Director of CIA at that
                    time.</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>A further not regarding the East Zone projects, as they came to be known. The
                    inspiration came the Germans in Bonn. Specifically, there was in the West German
                    cabinet a ministry for all-German affairs charged with keeping the spirit of
                    German unity alive. There was not much they could do under the circumstances,
                    but they did devise these programs as a means of maintaining all-German contacts
                    and requested our assistance. Eleanor once again decided to tape FOA funds. FOA
                    felt this was something that belonged in the bailiwick of her other brother,
                    Allen Dulles, and not a suitable program for economic assistance. After a brief
                    skirmish, she got her way. Sometime in 1955, the German Bureau was reduced in
                    size and became an office in the European Bureau, reflecting our reduced
                    responsibilities in Germany. The office director was Cecil Lyon who had a nice
                    easy relationship with Eleanor. I thought he handled her very well. His door was
                    always open, and he always kept a moderating hand on Eleanor's bureaucratic
                    battles.</p>
                <p>Two or three times a year Mrs. Dulles would make her visits to Bonn and Berlin.
                    During that period, the High Commissioner was Dr. James Conant at Harvard
                    University; he was succeeded by a career man, Walter Dowling. She would
                    typically go first to Bonn, where she usually managed to get in to see “Der
                    Alta,” the German chancellor, as well as other German officials who had some
                    influence on administrating these programs which we were funding. Then she would
                    spend maybe a week or ten days in Berlin. She cut quite a swath through the
                    scene in West Berlin at that time. She knew and saw a lot of people and she saw
                    a lot of people. In time her name became so identified with visible projects in
                    Berlin, such as the Congress Hall and a hospital in Berlin-Stieglitz that
                    eventually became known as “Die Mutti von Berlin” (in this connection the German
                    word might conjure up the idea of a mother hen).</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you routinely accompany her on these trips to
                        Berlin?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: No, I didn't go on these trips. I had to stay home and mop up after her
                    departure and read the long notes she left for me about how I was supposed to
                    handle everything that was going to come up in the next two or three weeks. That
                    was a bit of a problem. Of course, I couldn't hold the fort quite as well as she
                    did for there were issues others hoped to settle when she was out of town. I had
                    good backing from Dan Margolies, who was the economic officer in charge, and
                    Cecil Lyon and Geoff Lewis. We managed to hold things together until she got
                    back.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I notice that in 1956 you became a Foreign Service Officer
                        05.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>JOHNSON: That was in accordance with the Wriston program. The foreign service
                    finally caught up with me at the right time, as I was married and the two of us
                    were ready to go abroad and we did. The assignment to Berlin came up, not
                    surprisingly, as a result of the initiative of Mrs. Dulles. There was an opening
                    in the economic section and she thought this was just the place for me to be,
                    particularly because the economic section had a great deal to do with the
                    economic and financial assistance, the programs that she was interested in. She
                    figured I had a good background from Washington and would have some sense of
                    what would fly well in Washington from the Berlin standpoint. With a major
                    blessing from that direction, I went to Berlin in the summer of '56 on transfer.
                    I had visited there once by myself while I worked for Eleanor, so I knew some of
                    the staff there. But I think the fact that I was assigned there was probably
                    widely read as “Well, I'm Eleanor's man in Berlin.” The last thing I wanted to
                    be. Almost from day one, I began to look toward a lateral transfer into another
                    section of the mission at Berlin so I could get away from the Berlin aid
                    problems which I really felt I'd had enough of anyway. Eventually I succeeded in
                    moving. In fact, I moved around a lot in that mission. A word about the mission.
                    It was a huge mission. It had started out as U.S. military government, then
                    became High Commission/Berlin and then in 1954 in an attempt to civilianize the
                    title to make it appear the Berliners were getting more authority, status and so
                    forth at this period of time, we became the U.S. Mission Berlin. Our resident
                    State Department chief was the senior FSO. He was the assistant chief and the
                    incumbent was Bernard Gufler. The deputy chief of the mission was U.S. Commander
                    Berlin, who was a major general, and the chief of the mission in Berlin was the
                    ambassador in Bonn. That was the hierarchy but the military had precedence on
                    the spot in Berlin because we still wanted to maintain this occupation status
                    because our very position there was based on military agreements that had been
                    reached in 1945 and we wanted to preserve the occupation status of the military
                    government period until some solution to the Berlin problem could be found. It
                    was for that reason we were co-located with a large Army headquarters which was
                    U.S. Command Berlin. There were, I suppose, about four thousand U.S. military in
                    Berlin, I'm not sure exactly what the number was, and the British and French had
                    comparably sized missions. This neither fish nor fowl mission which we worked in
                    had conventional sections, such as political and economic and public affairs and
                    administration but it also had very special sections. It had an Eastern Affairs
                    section, which was responsible for reporting on East German affairs. Since we
                    had no relations with the German authority in East Germany, it was important to
                    keep ourselves informed on what was going on there because we could only have
                    limited travel there. This was a five man section. We also had a public safety
                    section, because we had direct authority over the Berlin police; we had three
                    officers in that section, one of whom was a career police officer. But in any
                    event, the liaison with the West Berlin police was an important part of that
                    operation. We also had a lot of people who came in from time-to- time from other
                    parts of West Berlin such as the U.S. prison guards at Spandau (where the
                    principal German war criminals were detained). I think we may have had four or
                    five officers who were career, I don't know whether you call them criminologists
                    or what, but they had previously been on duty in the federal prison system. It
                    was a very interesting group of diverse people who served in the U.S.
                    mission.</p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>My assignment in Berlin began in the economic section but fairly soon after I
                    arrived there I began a series of TDYs to other sections because there were
                    people going on home leave and so forth. I spent three or four months in the
                    political section as the Allied Liaison and Protocol Officer, which was
                    interesting from the fact that this was the point in the mission where there was
                    a steady liaison with a Soviet official over in the Soviet embassy on Unter den
                    Linden (East Berlin) and this was the channel through which we passed protest
                    notes to the Russians (and they to us). Our channel was either through the
                    Soviet embassy or else, when it still existed, we passed notes to the Soviet
                    military Kommandatura which was out in Karlshorst (East Berlin). After a certain
                    point the Soviets abolished the position of Berlin Kommandant so that was no
                    longer a channel for us to deal with the many access problems we had with the
                    Soviets. Our notes per force then had to go to this big embassy on Unter den
                    Linden. I was one of three. There was a French Protocol Officer and a British
                    Protocol Officer. Whenever we had a note to deliver, it was always the three of
                    us passing three identical notes simultaneously to the Soviets. There was one
                    phone in West Berlin that we could use to phone over there and let them know we
                    were coming. We three then would go into this formidable concrete fortress (the
                    Soviet embassy), it was an incredible, forbidding sort of a structure. We were
                    ushered into an office which often reeked of vodka, cigarette smoke, and bottles
                    that hadn't been put away. We would sit there and then the Soviet protocol
                    officer would come in. He was very cordial, his English, we dealt with him in
                    English, was quite good, and so we would deliver our notes. We would say “Here
                    it is and it's about what you did on the Autobahn yesterday” or whatever it was,
                    and so forth, and he would accept our notes politely. Similarly, if he had a
                    note to give back to us we would be summoned. We would meet someplace en route
                    that was central and then drive together through the checkpoints, past the
                    Brandenburg Gate. So this was an interesting experience for a while, but it
                    paled after a while since it was less substance and more formalities. That was
                    one of many side trips I made when I was in the mission. I was also “borrowed”
                    by Gufler to fill in as staff assistant for three months while the incumbent
                    went home on home leave. Both times this happened, it was my lot to have a visit
                    to Berlin by the Secretary of State. The first time it happened, it seemed a bit
                    overpowering. I thought, “Oh, my God, how am I going to do this?” I hadn't
                    really had much experience in the foreign service but the formidable Gufler
                    said, “You're the man to do it.” Our first Secretary of State visitor was John
                    Foster Dulles, with a huge entourage. They had been in a NATO ministerial
                    meeting in Copenhagen. Since the location was close to Berlin and probably at
                    the behest of none other than sister, he was prevailed upon to come and make a
                    morale building trip to Berlin. It was probably timed to coincide with some
                    critical period in our relations with the Russians. They were putting a lot of
                    pressure on us to do something or other and it was thought that the presence of
                    the Secretary of State would be a good bucking up to indicate that we're here to
                    stay; and that the security and welfare of Berlin remained essential U.S.
                    security goals. So John Foster Dulles came with all his people. The preparations
                    were interesting. I must say it took care of itself rather easily, much easier
                    than I had imagined. But there was one thing that was nice about running a
                    program like that, and I was the coordinator for the whole damn outfit. The
                    military are experts in running visits and programs and organizing things. They
                    had all the resources in the world. You never had to worry about a car or
                    anything like that. I would convene these meetings every morning and we would
                    sort of plan minute-by- minute. They had all these colonels in there from USCOB.
                    There I was, sitting at the head of the table, it was funny, all these colonels
                    were hanging on my every word. It was nervewracking but it was enjoyable, too.
                    Everything went fine. All the drivers, I had to brief each one of them
                    individually to make sure they didn't turn in the wrong direction, which had
                    happened before. It all went beautifully and there was no problem. The Secretary
                    and party were accompanied by people from the Executive Secretariat [S/S] and I
                    got along with all those folks okay. That is probably the reason why I ended up
                    in S/S when I left Berlin, which would have been three years later. The visit
                    experience repeated itself after Dulles' death. Christian Herter had become
                    Secretary of State and he had never been to Berlin. He was not a figure who was
                    identified with Berlin and they wanted to get him there. So I ran that program
                    again, and again everything went well.</p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>Q: Meanwhile, following Germany's entry into NATO in 1955 it was a founding
                    member of the EEC in 1957 so significant events were going on in the background
                    that affected Germany as a whole. Did this get reflected in your work in Berlin
                    or were you largely removed by your special location?</p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>JOHNSON: In Berlin we were on the sidelines. What came first was the Coal Steel
                    Community, which was of great significance to West Germany as the beginning of
                    the European integration movement - the Monet Plan - and the move toward western
                    unity. These relationships really were not an important factor in Berlin. What
                    was important in Berlin on a larger scale, during the period I was there, fell
                    actually into two periods. The initial period, say '56 to '59, was a period
                    where the Soviets were not putting the emphasis so directly on getting us out of
                    Berlin, but complicating our daily lives in Berlin and attacking the modalities
                    of our access into Berlin. So we had endless problems that had to do with the
                    way our transit orders looked as we were moving from Helmstedt to Babelsberg,
                    the Berlin end of the principal autobahn. The question of checking cargo on
                    military convoys. The question of documenting how many soldiers were in a
                    convoy. How the trains moved because there were nine permitted train paths daily
                    between Berlin and West Germany under the '45 agreements. These trains passed
                    through the Soviet Zone. Again they went through checkpoints and these
                    checkpoints always had the potential of being the scene of all this Soviet
                    chicanery and making life difficult for us and wanting people to get out of
                    their train cars in the middle of the night and be counted - head counts. Life
                    was just a series of problems of that sort and that persisted up until October
                    1958. With regard to Berlin's economy, this was the beginning of a real take off
                    in Berlin. Berlin was probably seven-eight years behind the Federal Republic in
                    economic recovery for obvious reasons. It had lost its economic hinterland. It
                    had been blockaded in the late '40s. The skilled manpower had left. The
                    population was over age. Historically it was the site of a major part of the
                    electrical engineering industry of Germany but it was very hard to keep all
                    these big industries, which were needed for employment purposes, in Berlin. To
                    keep them busy, to keep them supplied, everything had to be brought in from the
                    West. But we did see in this period, the beginnings of a recovery and gradually
                    unemployment began to fall and we began to see some returns in joint efforts -
                    the Berliners, the Germans, the Bonn Germans and the foreign aid that we were
                    supplying. So it was a rather encouraging picture that was beginning to unfold
                    as we moved into 1958. A change manifested itself in November 1958 when it
                    became apparent that Kruschev and the Politburo had made a decision to try a new
                    tack with the allies in Germany. What they wanted to do was make a real effort
                    to force us out of Berlin. They had tried that once with the blockade in
                    '48-'49. They had obviously not succeeded and they had swallowed that. That was
                    the first Berlin crisis. The second Berlin crisis began in 1958 when we all
                    received notes saying the Soviets, within six months, were going to relinquish
                    their occupation responsibilities, vis a vis their zone of Germany, and that
                    with regard to questions of Berlin and access thereto, we would simply have to
                    settle with the German Democratic Republic, as they called it. That initiated a
                    crisis period which sort of dominated, certainly the next six months, because we
                    were given until - I think it was until May - to come to some sort of agreement
                    with the GDR or else the Soviets would just flat out turn over all their
                    responsibilities to the East Germans, i.e., presumably they would disappear from
                    all the checkpoints. They would no longer send someone into the air safety
                    control center. All the modalities of our presence of getting in and out of
                    Berlin would be placed in the hands of the East Germans.</p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>So the period beginning in November 1958 in Berlin for the people who were
                    stationed there, who were living there, was in a way anomalous. Our friends and
                    relatives back in the States felt that we were in the lions mouth, living under
                    this threat. Whereas, in fact, there was a great serenity in West Berlin about
                    this Soviet threat. This is the time when the Berliners show their best colors.
                    They have always thrived on challenges and their finest hours have been under
                    stress, pressure, and threat. This was proved during the first Berlin crisis,
                    '48-'49 and it continued to be so over the years. So life went on. We shook our
                    oratorical fists at the Soviets and said, “We are not backing down.” Obviously a
                    great deal of contingency planning began. In fact, it had always been underway,
                    but was now certainly expedited in Washington. We had only a vague idea of what
                    was being planned in Washington. In fact, I only found out about this when I
                    started declassifying the documents after retirement back in Washington for
                    publication. That is the extremely detailed nature of our military contingency
                    planning. Also the diplomatic track was explored and what in effect happened was
                    that the six month deadline passed without incident since we had already begun
                    the process of negotiations with the Soviets. There was great concern after
                    November 1958 about Allied solidarity and willingness to stand strong against
                    this threat from the Soviets. By this time John Foster Dulles was suffering from
                    cancer and was not well. He soldiered on however, and after the last NATO
                    ministerial in '59 he made a trip from capital to capital (Bonn-Paris-London),
                    the purpose of which was to make sure the allies were going to be solid, that
                    our positions were mutually agreed. In a way it was a sort of heroic thing that
                    he did because he was in so much pain at the time. In fact, I guess it was in
                    April 1959 he passed away. Christian Herter, who had been the Under Secretary,
                    took over his position and it was with Herter and the others that this
                    negotiation process was initiated. This led to a series of Foreign Ministers
                    meetings in Geneva in the summer of 1959. No agreement was reached at the time
                    with the Soviets about the issues they had raised but at least it appeared the
                    Soviets had decided they had pushed so far and they weren't going to push any
                    further for the foreseeable future.</p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>We continued to try to figure out the Soviets' objectives. I think it was obvious
                    that one of the things that Khrushchev wanted was a visit to the United States.
                    The visit did take place and it may be recalled that Khrushchev was invited to
                    Camp David in the Catoctin Mountains in Maryland in September 1959 where he
                    spent several days discussing issues with Eisenhower and staff. It was in a
                    press conference at Camp David that Khrushchev first made a clear announcement
                    indicating that he was not going to push us out of Berlin. Berlin was in a
                    holding pattern and there was nothing to be feared. They were not going to make
                    our lives difficult for awhile. His next objective of course, was to achieve a
                    summit meeting. The spirit of Camp David lasted through the winter of '59-'60
                    and led up to the long expected meeting in Paris of the four at the summit. Then
                    along comes Gary Francis Powers! This was in April or May of 1960. Without going
                    into any great detail about that meeting - it's a well known part of our
                    history. The conference broke up and Khrushchev and his people, when they left
                    Paris to go back to Moscow came through Berlin. By this time I was working in
                    the Eastern Affairs section of the Mission in Berlin and one of the tasks for
                    our section that day was to go over to East Berlin and station ourselves along
                    the path the motorcade was going to take from the airport to the Soviet embassy
                    on Under den Linden. We all went out in our tackiest clothes and went over to
                    mingle with the civilians and troops to see the sight. We saw him, indeed about
                    ten feet away from us waving and next to him was the dreadful leader of the East
                    German government, Walter Ulbricht (looking like he had just swallowed the cat).
                    In fact, the message that was being given to him by Khrushchev was that he was
                    not going to push anything with the allies for awhile now. Khrushchev could
                    clearly see the end of the Eisenhower administration coming up. There would be a
                    new president and whatever moves he was going to make on Berlin would be
                    reserved for the next administration. In essence he was saying this in East
                    Berlin to the East German Parliament even though not in these terms to us.</p>
                <p>By that time, I had moved from the EconomiSection and was working in the Eastern
                    Affairs Section where I was reporting on East German developments. We tried to
                    go over to East Berlin as frequently as possible just to size up living
                    conditions and clues to communist policy. East Berlin was a fascinating place
                    and a small microcosm of East Germany. It contained the historic center of
                    Berlin. It also was so large it contained considerable farmland within its city
                    limits. We would visit East Berlin in our private cars bearing U.S. military
                    plates and look into things, poke around in the stores and see what was on the
                    shelves to size up how the economy was doing. It wasn't doing very well. That
                    was always a problem for the East German government.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you able to get into East Germany itself?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>JOHNSON: When I first went to Berlin it was possible, occasionally, to obtain
                    Soviet visas to travel into East Germany. Very soon after we arrived there, my
                    wife and I went to Leipzig to a Leipzig fair. This was a standard thing for
                    people from the mission to do. It was an opportunity to look at Leipzig and all
                    the heavy machinery displayed there and try to make an assessment of the state
                    of their industry. The only other place we were ever able to get documentation
                    from the Soviets for was Potsdam. This was really very close to the border with
                    West Berlin. I think sometime in the second year I was there, as part of their
                    policy to turn more authority over to the East Germans, the Soviets told us they
                    would no longer issue visas for any travel whatsoever in East Germany. We would
                    have to get permission from the East Germans, which of course we could not
                    accept. That ended our travel in East Germany. It was unfortunate because we
                    were reporting on a country we couldn't enter. All we could do was go over into
                    East Berlin. Of course we read their press voluminously. That was one of the
                    daily challenges: to wade through 10 pages of “Neues Deutschland” every morning.
                    We began to have a few problems getting across the border toward the end of my
                    stay there - that is, sector-sector border in the center of Berlin. As part of
                    their efforts to turn things over, the Soviets would occasionally authorize East
                    German sector border guards to stop us and ask for our papers. Our instructions
                    were to deal only with Soviet soldiers. There were maybe nine sector-sector
                    crossing points at that time and sometimes my wife and I would go to the opera
                    in East Berlin at night and it would be dark coming back so you had to go slowly
                    as you crossed over so they could read your license. There was not any formal
                    checkpoint like what Checkpoint Charlie was to become a year later. There was
                    simply a group of East German guards standing out in front of Brandenburg Gate
                    and you had to slow down for them. Sometimes they would make you stop and we
                    would point to our license plate. They would play dumb and say, “Well, I need to
                    see your papers.” And we would say, “Oh, no, you don't and if you have any
                    problem with this just call the Soviets about it.” Which they never did. This
                    was just a curtain raiser of a much bigger problem that came up after I left
                    Berlin.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, in 1961, you had to leave Berlin and move on and

                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>JOHNSON: As I indicated earlier, probably because I'd had some contact with
                    people in the Secretary of States's office during visits to Berlin, instead of
                    going to the mid-career course I went to S/S for a two year assignment
                    ('61-'63). There are a couple of interesting things that can be said about that
                    from the standpoint of organization and development of the State Department.
                    When I entered the office it was called S/S-RO (Reports and Operations). There
                    was no such thing as an operation center then. This was at the beginning of the
                    Kennedy administration. The function of S/S-RO was to move staff paper from the
                    bureaus into the principle's office (mostly the Secretary or the Under
                    Secretary). The State Department organization was somewhat underdeveloped at
                    that particular point. You had watch officers in the telegram unit and they were
                    charged with following certain subjects by duty officers in the bureaus. They
                    were the men who were running shifts in the telegraph branch of the department
                    who would be responsible for alerting the bureaus in the middle of the night
                    about some really important development. They were the ones who exerted judgment
                    about calling bureau officers in the middle of the night. It was beginning to
                    dawn on us, when I joined S/S-RO, that this was not adequate for a situation
                    where you had a White House very actively interested in foreign affairs and
                    possessing a well staffed situation room. The military had their counterpart.
                    All we had was a small group of staff officers from whom we furnished a single
                    departmental duty officer for a week at a time. This rotated among us officers
                    in S/S-RO. About every three months, one of the operations officers was given
                    the job of being the departmental duty officer, going up front, taking over from
                    the Executive Secretary when he went home for the day, clearing out paper on his
                    behalf and staying as long as anybody else was up there. My colleagues and I
                    dreaded this because it was very long hours and you felt like you were holding
                    up the walls of the department.</p>
                <p>Before the old system was abandoned, I was the departmental duty officer during
                    the Cuban Missile Crisis. I practically lived up front (i.e., the Executive
                    Secretary's office), we were there all night, and we watched the sun come up
                    over the Potomac. It was before midnight that we had a note delivered from the
                    Soviet embassy and we immediately summoned a fellow by the name of Akalovsky,
                    who was the principal Russian interpreter and translator in the Department. We
                    gave him this message from Khrushchev to President Kennedy on nuclear weapons in
                    Cuba. Just after he finished it, another Soviet letter came in and it was quite
                    different in tone. The first one was the belligerent one. The second one was
                    more civil and reasonable. I was watching Akalovsky from afar. He said “These
                    are two different telegrams - I can't quite understand it.” It took a lot of
                    very high ranking people (i.e., the President) to try and figure out what to
                    make out of that. We all know the story of how we decided to respond to the
                    positive one. That was perhaps the most interesting few hours I spent in S/S,
                    much of which was taken up in the routine staffing of papers. During that
                    period, they finally decided to create the operations center needed as a focus
                    for a high level watch operation. It was very modest in its beginnings and it
                    was hard to get people to come in and staff these operations. We were quite
                    happy they came into existence because we were relieved of the late night duty
                    operation.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then came your reward in 1963 when you were made officer
                        in chargof the East German Political Affairs.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: There was some sensitivity to setting up a unit within the Office of
                    German Affairs that implied we were concentrating on East Germany as an entity.
                    The West Germans were very sensitive to anything that had to do with the status
                    of the GDR, as were we, too. This was a new position in the Office of German
                    Affairs and before I arrived in the office, the director at that time (Bob
                    Creel) went to the German ambassador and told him what they planned to do and
                    why. We thought it would be a useful division of functions in the office with
                    absolutely no political implications. The new section also included Berlin
                    affair, too. It was under those auspices that I returned to the German circuit.
                    By that time the office had become smaller than it was when I left it seven
                    years before. A lot of effort went into dealing with all the problems posed by
                    the East Germans who were always attempting to obtain recognition. It was the
                    sort of issue you don't think about from the outside, but the East Germans were
                    continually striving to attend international meetings; or strive for observer
                    status; or pass themselves off as Soviet advisers at international meetings. The
                    situation in Berlin changed dramatically in August 1961 when the Soviets,
                    perhaps at the behest of Walter Ulbricht or perhaps they didn't need much
                    prompting, decided to stem the flow of refugees that were leaving East Germany.
                    This had been a problem for the East Germans from the earliest post-war years,
                    but it got to the point where 50 or 60 thousand people a month were departing
                    East Germany. This was perhaps the worst episode of flight that had occurred
                    since the split of Germany. Something had to be done. A decision was made by the
                    Soviets that they would permit the erection of a wall that ran through the
                    center of Berlin and divided the Soviet sector from the three Western
                    sectors.</p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>In response to construction of the wall and the fact that a tremendous number of
                    people in the department were having to focus full time on the Berlin crises -
                    the decision was made in the European Bureau to set up a Berlin task force. It
                    was a unit closely related to the Office of German Affairs but a different
                    location and separate staff, many of whom were drawn from German office. Some of
                    the returning people from Bonn and Berlin were put into it and a senior officer
                    was in charge - Martin Hillenbrand. My work tended to overlap with them quite a
                    bit because I was dealing with Berlin on the eastern side of things. We were
                    then moving into a period of intense planning which was called “Berlin
                    contingency planning.” This was an effort to pull together and sharpen what had
                    been on paper in general terms, but never in a focused form since the nature of
                    the threat was less clear in earlier days, and concentrated on interruptions to
                    access between West Germany and West Berlin. In short, there had always been a
                    general plan but when the wall went up it was clear they had to do some fast and
                    thorough work. The Berlin Task Force staffed what became known as the
                    quadripartite group in Washington. It was composed, of Assistant Secretary Foy
                    Kohler on the U.S. side, and the ambassadors from the U.K., France, and the FRG.
                    The Germans were now brought into the military planning for the first time in
                    depth. We all became part of this planning operation and part of my job was
                    dealing with countermeasures. What kind of action could we implement in response
                    to Soviet/GDR harassment? Some of these counter measures were in the field of
                    controlling travel of East Germans. We didn't recognize East German passports,
                    so we issued Allied documents called TTDs (temporary travel documents). That was
                    an allied function carried out in West Berlin. As an example of countermeasures
                    in response to Soviet pressure on us in Berlin, we threatened to cancel these
                    visits of East Germans to the West. We weren't interested in discouraging travel
                    by the ordinary person at all. This had to do with East German cultural figures
                    and sometimes East German trade officials because some of our allies did have
                    unofficial trade relations with the East German regime. The U.S. never did.
                    Controlling travel was one part of it. Controlling trade was another aspect of
                    countermeasures, but this was primarily for the West Germans because they were
                    the principal trade partners of the East Germans. This trade was known as
                    “interzonal trade” and it was carried on between the two parts of Germany in an
                    unofficial way to avoid diplomatic recognition. The West German negotiator was
                    not a ministerial person. He was known as a trustee for interzonal trade. The
                    East German was designated in the same manner. In the realm of interzonal trade,
                    we from time to time tried to push the West Germans to cut off certain essential
                    supplies when the East side was acting up. East Germany was not blessed with
                    natural resources outside of brown coal and therefore they were vulnerable to
                    pressure from the West German side. In any event, trade countermeasures, travel
                    countermeasures, and detailed military countermeasures were all part of the
                    contingency planning effort.</p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>One of the interesting events that occurred during my two year assignment in the
                    Office of German Affairs was the visit of President Kennedy to Europe. This was
                    a multi country visit and toward the end of it he went to Germany. Of course he
                    went armed with all the briefing books in the world, which we had designed and
                    composed. Before he went to Berlin he had at least one day and maybe a day and a
                    half in Frankfort. In Frankfort he gave an important speech on European unity.
                    In the briefing book we had prepared talking points which covered what he might
                    say in Berlin, but no speech text. What we gave him was very antiseptic I'm
                    sure. They were going to Berlin the next day and we received by telegram from
                    the consulate general in Frankfort the text of a speech someone in the party had
                    drafted for the President to deliver at his principal appearance in Berlin. Bob
                    Creel and I read it and I have to say it was pretty bad. It had absolutely no
                    “Kennedy” flair to it whatsoever. We were wondering “Well, who in the hell wrote
                    that because that's not what we put in the book.” The telegram asked for
                    comments and that was what was embarrassing because we didn't know what to do.
                    We hated to step on anyone's toes, not knowing whose toes were involved. Bob got
                    on the phone with somebody who was with the party, somebody from the State
                    Department, and he was very frank with him and told him to do a little better.
                    Bob was told there was already an effort underway to redo the speech. Overnight,
                    what was really a bad speech was converted in some magic way into the speech
                    that was given by the President the next day at Rudolph Wilde Platz, the town
                    hall for the West Berlin government. This speech became history - “Ich bin ein
                    Berliner.” I remember when we started hearing about the speech the next day we
                    were just flabbergasted. It was like taking a show out of town into Boston
                    that's really a turkey and somehow converting it into a smash hit. That is what
                    happened here. It was a very rewarding thing.</p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>The last event I'll mention about my tour in GER was a sad event because this was
                    November 22, 1963. We were in the office and began to hear these dreadful rumors
                    about the President being shot on a visit to Dallas, Texas. It was a strange
                    scene, people were wandering around the halls of the department. It was a sense
                    of terrible disorientation. We still didn't know whether he was alive or dead
                    and then we saw the flag outside going down and we knew the President had died.
                    One only has a limited amount of time for reflecting and now this is all a part
                    of history. As it turned out, all the desks in the Department had to furnish
                    escort officers for the visitors who were coming to the funeral ceremonies. With
                    regard to the Germans, they sent the President of Germany, who was Heinrich
                    L�bke. By that time, Adenauer had retired and the Chancellor was Ludwig Erhard.
                    The two of them came and in our office it was decided that we had to have escort
                    officers for them throughout the day. We did it in shifts and I was on the first
                    shift which involved picking up the Germans at the Shoreham Hotel. We met them
                    there with vehicle, the driver, and protocol escort. It was my function to
                    accompany L�bke and Erhard through the first part of the day's schedule. The
                    first part of the schedule involved going to the funeral mass at St. Matthew's.
                    There wasn't room for the escort officers inside, but we had the reflection of a
                    moment in history. At a certain point after the funeral mass and after the
                    solemn parade down Connecticut Avenue to the White House, our vehicle moved to
                    someplace down by the ellipse. We again picked up the German President and the
                    Chancellor and drove to Arlington Cemetery for the very moving graveside
                    ceremony. I remember both the Germans were very short so I could look over their
                    heads and see what was going on. Right next to me was the tallest man of all -
                    DeGaulle. Months later the National Geographic Society magazine ran a spread on
                    the ceremony. There was a photograph of everyone standing around the grave side
                    and I could see myself looming over the Germans but overshadowed by Charles De
                    Gaulle. The enduring memory of that day was the vision of Mrs. Kennedy across
                    the gravesite like some Madonna of Sorrows and the excruciating sound of Taps
                    sounding over the ceremony.</p>
                <p>Q: Finally we get to your reward for all your hard labors on German affairs in
                    1965 as you go off to be number two at our Consulate General in Milan.</p>
                <p>JOHNSON: In 1965, Milan was one of seven consular posts in Italy, an unusual
                    number for a country of Italy's size. The reasons were historical. Most of these
                    posts had been established before Italy was united. Our oldest consulate was
                    created by George Washington in Trieste in 1792 which was then in
                    Austria-Hungary. You could find the same thing with Naples, same thing with
                    Palermo, which belonged to the Spanish Bourbons. We always considered that Milan
                    was the most important one since Milan was the second largest city in Italy. It
                    was widely regarded as the economic, financial, and banking capital of Italy. It
                    was also quite clear it was the cultural capital of Italy, with the opera, the
                    theater that functioned there, as well as the presence of most of the major
                    Italian publishing houses. A varied metropolis of a million and three quarters
                    people.</p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>When I got there in 1965, Italy was governed by a center left coalition which had
                    only been in existence for a few years. Up to 1963 the Socialists had not been
                    in any government except, briefly, the Unity Government that was set up right
                    after the liberation in 1945. The subject of socialist participation in the
                    government in Italy was a controversial issue prior to '65. Primarily because
                    the socialists had chosen to associate themselves with the Italian Communist
                    Party in 1948 in the unity of action arrangement. It was a long time before the
                    Socialists became sufficiently disillusioned with the communists to break off
                    and move over toward support of the Christian Democratic Party, which was really
                    the focal point and the foundation of every government in Italy from '45 on.</p>
                <p>The entry of the Italian Socialist Party into the government was controversial.
                    There was a lot of infighting in the Department of State and the White House on
                    the issue. The people who opposed bringing them in were very negative on the
                    Socialists. We were still fighting the Cold War and the opponents were skeptical
                    that the Socialists had put enough daylight between themselves and the
                    communists, particularly on issues like NATO. Pietro Nenni was the leader of
                    what was called the autonomous group of the Socialists. Autonomous signified
                    autonomy from the PCI (communist party). Once Nenni got control of the party
                    apparatus and got 75 percent of his people behind him, then it was easier for
                    the Christian Democrats to being them into the government. My assignment
                    coincided with the first years of their cooperation in running the
                    government.</p>
                <p>In the mid-'60s, Italy was a country which was beginning to show a tremendous
                    recovery and already had one of the most developed economies in the world. They
                    had also gone through, in the early '60s, a major political transformation. This
                    was usually called “the opening to the left” but what it involved was bringing
                    the Socialists into the government coalition with the Christian Democrats. This
                    had been an issue which had been very divisive for many years, going all the way
                    back to the famous American ambassador, Claire Booth Luce, who fought like a
                    tigress to keep the Socialists as far away from the halls of government as she
                    possibly could. The battle continued long after Mrs. Luce and there were
                    remnants of opposition in the State Department up to the early Kennedy years.
                    One of the things that happened at that particular point was that historian
                    Arthur Schlesinger, Jr. joined the NSC staff and became, for whatever reason, a
                    great partisan and arbiter of the center left, fighting what he perceived to be
                    the “reactionary” European Bureau. The position of the ambassador, Freddie
                    Reinhard, seemed to be in the middle of this issue. Bill Tyler was the Assistant
                    Secretary of EUR and he had a very reasonable view. If I had been around at that
                    time fighting that battle, I would probably have been on the side of the center
                    left. I didn't see any point in forcing the Socialists to say they had always
                    believed in NATO and swear on a stack of Bibles. I thought the mathematics of
                    the thing was such that you just had to accept them and have confidence they
                    would change their views. History has shown that not only was there a great
                    transformation of the socialists, but Heaven forbid, there was a transformation
                    of the communists in Italy. This is witnessed by the fact that one of them is
                    now Prime Minister of Italy.</p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>That's the background. What did a big consulate like Milan do in the mid-'60s in
                    Italy? Probably less interesting things than it could have done, because of the
                    attitude in the embassy in Rome that they didn't want these consulates getting
                    out of hand. They didn't really want us to do political reporting, and not much
                    economic reporting. We had some freedom on the latter because we were located in
                    what everyone conceded was the economic and financial capital of the country and
                    we were surrounded by the area which was making for this so called Italian
                    miracle. While we were conceded some economic reporting, anything that was
                    political had to be constructed in the form of a draft air gram which was sent
                    down to whoever was political counselor. They would decide whether they wanted
                    to send it or not. Sometimes they would take all of our names off and send it
                    out as if they had written it. Other times they gave us a little credit. The big
                    thing for an American mission at that time was commercial promotion. We were
                    getting into this balance of payments problem period. We were very sensitive to
                    balance of payments deficits and we were trying to promote, promote, and promote
                    American business, particularly first-time exporters. So I suppose I spent fifty
                    percent of my time in Milan on this. We had our U.S. Trade Center there, a
                    Commerce Department establishment, which was located at the fairgrounds in
                    Milan. That was a major operation which ran a seven or eight months long series
                    of exhibitions of American products, usually items new to the Italian market.
                    These American exhibitors who might number as many as 30 or 40, would come in
                    with a hope of gaining a partnership or some sort of relationship with Italian
                    importers. By and large, I think it was a successful operation. The Commerce
                    Department trade center operation was in its heyday in the 1960s when I was
                    there and we did what we could to help the operation. The centers were staffed
                    by State Department FSOs, although the director was usually someone hired by the
                    Department of Commerce. Altogether, there were perhaps five or six Americans
                    whose office was at the Milan fairgrounds. We had our own commerce section in
                    the consulate general, too, which did a lot of trade promotion. All of which was
                    designed to move forward our objectives in exports.</p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>During the three years I was in Milan a remarkable situation was unfolding in
                    Rome. The Italians had the same Prime Minister the entire three years. In fact,
                    he had already been in office a year before I got there and he was to last a
                    year after I departed. That man was Aldo Moro. I think you would have to go a
                    long way to find anyone who had held the job that long consecutively. Perhaps
                    the Socialist Craxi in the '80s. Craxi's long tenure proved the walls didn't
                    come down - the coliseum still stood and U.S. policy interests were not in any
                    way damaged by having socialists running the government of Rome. In Milan, we
                    were the largest consulate. Our consul general was the dean of the consular
                    corps and had already been there six years when I arrived. I had been promised
                    he would go home and retire after a few months. He stayed on a year and a half.
                    This was Earl T. Crane. He was a person who believed you never turned down an
                    invitation to anything. Since he had been there so long everybody knew him and
                    he was Dean or “Decano” of the consular corps. I found myself going to some
                    strange functions. I'll relate one thing that suddenly comes back to me. If he
                    didn't want to go or couldn't go to something, he would always send the
                    invitation in to me with a handwritten “represent me please.” So one time I got
                    this card and there was a memorial ceremony for a very controversial man who had
                    founded an entity called ENI, which was the national petroleum trust. The man
                    was quite controversial because he was trying to break into “seven sisters”
                    society of big oil and gain some concessions on behalf of Italy. He kept
                    complaining to Americans about the fact that Italy was being shut out.
                    Controversial though he was, he was very able, was a supporter of the Christian
                    Democrats, and for the most part a spur in our hide. He died in a plane crash
                    off the shores of Sicily. This was perhaps the third or fourth anniversary of
                    his death, and I was dispatched to some little church to attend this. I'll never
                    forget the strange looks I drew from all the officialdom there. They couldn't
                    figure out why in the world an American had come to this affair. It was known he
                    was not our favorite Italian, and his methods were not our preferred. Sometimes
                    discretion did not guide where I ended up going. I was very glad to get back in
                    the car and drive back to Milan after that one. But we continued to “show up”
                    and show the U.S. flag in whatever way we could.</p>

                <p>JOHNSON: Leaving Italy in a rather calm period in 1968, but there wasn't calm
                    everywhere in Europe at that time. This was the period when the French students
                    were beginning to stir. Eventually in 1969, that movement infected the Italian
                    students. This led to a certain amount of political instability, which combined
                    with nationwide strikes over contract renewals gave the appearance of crisis,
                    even though the situation was less than critical. So the students were first.
                    Then you began to see the beginnings of what the Italians call “contestazione.”
                    What that really means - it doesn't translate very well - is something like
                    political confrontation. The theory behind this was hatched among a group of
                    sociology professors at Catholic faculties of several universities in the North.
                    Trento was one of the universities that gave birth to these theories. There were
                    others in Padua. This was the beginning of the Red Brigade movement. People
                    didn't know exactly what to call them at this stage so sometimes they were
                    called “Maoists.” It was the beginning of a manifestation which was hatched in
                    '69. I came back to Italy in 1979. We were still dealing rather dramatically, in
                    some ways, with the Red Brigade. But back to the Department in 1968. Secretary
                    Rusk had decided that the basic organizational unit in the geographic bureaus
                    should be country directorates. What this meant was cutting back the size of the
                    offices so that instead of having a grouping of five or six countries, you might
                    have two or three or maybe just one. Back of this was the thought that when the
                    Secretary wanted to know something about Italy, for instance, he knew he could
                    call the country director for Italy on the phone and he would be able to respond
                    to him directly. I'm not sure it worked out all that well. On the other hand,
                    I'm not saying we had any problems with it. Italy was grouped with Austria and
                    Switzerland at that particular point, and the Country Director of my grouping
                    was Wells Stabler, who had a lot of experience in Italy and had been in Austria,
                    too, and was a superb person to work for.</p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>This form of organization endured until about 1972 or '73 and then a decision was
                    made to re-amalgamate the offices. There was a reconstitution of the old Western
                    European Affairs, which included our countries as well as France and Benelux. My
                    position became deputy director of that office, although I continued to keep my
                    hand in a lot of things of Italian interest. The early '70s were not the calmest
                    days of government coalition of Italy. There was a lot of interparty scrapping
                    and socialists kept worrying that they were losing votes on the left. But while
                    appearance was otherwise, Italy was not unstable and this is the point I think
                    always needs to be made. In general, people understandably assumed that the
                    existence of 35 or 40 governments since 1945 indicated great instability. Well,
                    that's not really true. Through all those periods of government shuffles,
                    basically the same party, up until 1980, was the center of the whole show and
                    that was the Christian Democratic Party. Sometimes they had the socialists and
                    sometimes the socialist democrats or the republicans with them in coalition. If
                    they were going to the right, they would have the liberals in. Basically there
                    was more storm about this than substance. The economy continued to expand while
                    all these great political debates were going on. It continued and there were
                    differences over personality, and there were differences between factions within
                    parties like fault lines in these parties. If something shook a little bit then
                    somebody had to be sacrificed and somebody could no longer be defense minister.
                    So cabinet portfolios were shifted, but often the issues were not that serious.
                    Basically, the Christian Democrats had accepted certain things to get the
                    socialists in the government, like nationalization of electrical energy, and
                    institution of the regional form of government. They had accepted some of the
                    major points of the socialist agenda in order to get them into the government
                    and to protect the left flank of the socialists against the PCI (the
                    communists). The picture changed a bit from government to government. Sometimes
                    you would find a minority government. Sometimes you would find a reconstituted
                    center left. During this period we had a change over in ambassadors in Rome.
                    Graham Martin, as most ambassadors, was granted an audience with the President
                    before he embarked for Rome. In most circumstances the assistant secretary from
                    the appropriate bureau or sometimes the office director would accompany. But in
                    the case of Graham Martin, he insisted on going alone. So we only knew from
                    Martin what the President's marching orders were, but we subsequently heard
                    often from Martin about the President's hope to see the Italians move back to
                    the middle of the political road. This would reflect the President's lingering
                    suspicions of the socialists. When Martin got to Rome, he constructed in his own
                    mind the ideal situation in which the socialists would be totally out of the
                    majority. Thus began his efforts to encourage the centrist elements in the
                    Christian Democratic Party.</p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>During this period, the Socialists were undergoing one of their identity crises
                    caused by fears that they were losing supporters through collaboration with the
                    DC. So they chose to stay out of the government, and this meant the conservative
                    elements of the DC emerged to take over the reins of government. Premiership
                    went to Giulio Andreotti, one of the most durable of the DC politicians. He had
                    been all over the left wing-right wing spectrum in the Christian Democratic
                    Party. At this point, he was in the conservative spectrum and succeeded in
                    forming a minority government. His reward was to be a visit to the White House.
                    The problem no time slots were open in a calendar tightly scheduled by Protocol
                    and the White House - at best, a real squeeze. But Martin, who was never one to
                    sit on his hands, had been on the phone with whomever he dealt with in the White
                    House pushing for this symbolic recognition that the Italian political spectrum
                    was back to the middle of the road. We of course were making our own efforts in
                    State Department channels to obtain White House approval, but weren't getting
                    any answers out of Haldeman and the White House gatekeepers. At one point, I got
                    a call from one of the deputy assistant secretaries in EUR, who at that time was
                    Margaret Tibbetts. She said “I think we've got a slot for Andreotti at the White
                    House. Would you call Rome and see if Andreotti could come March 17.” I passed
                    this message on to the DCM, Wells Stabler, and in due course we got a message
                    back saying Andreotti would be delighted to accept the invitation. Silence from
                    the White House, and the realization that the “invitation” was only
                    “exploratory.” There was only a potential open slot for Andreotti. The problem
                    was - the fat was in the fire in Rome - an invitation had been issued and it was
                    going to be very embarrassing to back off. Martin played this to the hilt to
                    squeeze out a visit, and if it failed to materialize, there was a fall guy handy
                    - me. Nothing happened for what seemed ages. We decided to go ahead and prepare
                    the standard briefing book for the visit even though there was still no approved
                    visit. In the end, the White House came up with a slot - it must have been the
                    first time in State Department history that a briefing book was completed before
                    the visit was approved. So in the end, Andreotti and Ambassador Martin got their
                    time at the White House. The White House gave him a big dinner and we had all
                    the Italo-American football players (Franco Harris) and football coaches (Joe
                    Paterno) there. The real prize was the after dinner entertainment. There was a
                    time when Frank Sinatra was not exactly socially acceptable in Washington
                    because he had gotten into a public brouhaha with a female correspondent at the
                    Ritz Carlton. We were a little surprised to see that Sinatra was to be
                    “rehabilitated” for the Andreotti White House dinner. Whether the somewhat
                    bookish Andreotti cared about Sinatra was dubious, but we enjoyed his program
                    thoroughly. The big irony: the White House visit was no help to keeping
                    Andreotti in office. Ten days after Andreotti returned to Rome, his government
                    fell. Then we went back to the center of the left. So much for “centrist”
                    government. We were back to the center left.</p>

                <p>Within a year or two, there was a vacancy at the embassy in Saigon and Graham
                    Martin was chosen to be ambassador in Saigon. He departed the Italian scene and
                    we had a solid strong Italo-American candidate to follow up in Rome. This was
                    the former Governor of Massachusetts - John Volpe. He was a genial man. I
                    briefed him, escorted him to a lot of his appointments through Washington. Of
                    course he was well known already because of his active political career. He was
                    one of the Italo-Americans who came from the region of Abruzzi in central Italy,
                    which is not too far from Rome. He was Secretary of Transportation before he was
                    appointed to Rome. He had found ways to make several special trips to Italy in
                    his Coast Guard plane even before he was thought of as a replacement for Graham
                    Martin. I think the only problem coming up with him was his Italian. As is so
                    often the case, Italians who come from Italy bring to this country their own
                    regional dialect and pronunciation. Quite frequently it is something different
                    from the standard Tuscan Italian that most Italians speak and that became, after
                    World War II, the standardized national language. I recall him speaking at the
                    Chamber of Commerce in Milan, a very prestigious Italo-American body, and
                    insisting on using Italian. I remember well businessmen coming up to me after
                    the speech, asking, “What did he say? What did he say? I can't understand a
                    word.” As ambassador, he initially preferred to go alone on calls on the Foreign
                    Minister. The embassy would sometimes receive calls from the foreign ministry
                    afterward asking, “Just exactly what was he talking about?”</p>
                <p>I had a chance to go be Political Counselor in Rome about 1973-74 when Bob
                    Beaudry, old friend and colleague, became DCM. It was an assignment that I would
                    have liked very much. Unfortunately, there was considerable illness in my family
                    at the time and I was unable to leave when the opening came up. So I never got
                    to Rome as political counselor. Another place I didn't get to was Cyprus. Wells
                    Stabler, by that time one of the deputy assistant secretaries in EUR, took an
                    interest in my onward assignment and one day introduced me to Roger Davies in
                    NEA. Davies was going to become ambassador in Cyprus and was looking for a DCM.
                    Wells introduced us and I had a long session with him. He seemed like a
                    marvelous guy; everybody had only the finest things to say about him. He asked
                    me if I would come as DCM and I said, “Yes, I would be very pleased to do that.”
                    So we began to make plans to go to Cyprus. I was in some sort of limbo - taking
                    Greek lessons at the FSI and winding down my job in EUR/WE. One day, word came
                    through that Davies had been killed by right wing Greek terrorists. The DCM,
                    whom I was to replace, had just left the country en route to Washington. So what
                    to do - the decision was to find the just departed DCM and send him back to
                    Nicosia. By this time, warfare had broken on Cyprus as the Turks invaded the
                    northern part of the island.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, I worked on the Cyprus task force while efforts were made to select a
                    new ambassador as fast as possible. Management told me to stand by while this
                    process went on. In the end, a new ambassador was found. He had his own choice
                    for DCM, and I was temporarily out of a job.</p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>But not for long. EUR and Personnel had been hassling over selection of a new
                    political counselor for the U.S. mission to the European Community (now European
                    Union). I became the designated hitter for this assignment. I knew just about
                    zero about what the EC did, except for what you would pick up being in the EUR
                    in putting together country briefing papers. At first, I was very surprised to
                    learn they had a political counselor and I wondered what in the world a
                    political counselor would do. I found out. I got there in the fall of 1974 as
                    head of a four man section, including one officer who was a labor specialist who
                    was the liaison to several European trade union organizations headquartered in
                    Brussels. What this section did, in addition to steady contact with the European
                    Trade Unions there, was to report on meetings of the Council of the EC. When the
                    Council met at ministerial level, and it was usually the foreign ministers who
                    convened every three to four weeks in Brussels, a special meeting might be
                    convened at the level of agricultural ministers when they came to talk about
                    aspects of European Common Agricultural Policy. These meetings were strictly
                    like an inter governmental organization. The ministers came there in the guise
                    of representing their countries, not as European officials. Of course the United
                    States was not a part of this European community and this was the big challenge
                    our mission as a non-member was to make sure we found out everything they were
                    doing. But we weren't under the tent so to speak. Certainly, it was very
                    important to our interests because of the economic factors involved. Our trade
                    with Europe, our exports, particularly in agricultural products, were important
                    national interests involved in dealing with the European Union. The Political
                    Section reported on the meetings of the Council and the officer who did that was
                    usually a junior officer. He operated much like a newspaper man, hanging out at
                    the Charlemagne Building in the press room trying to find out what was going on
                    inside, usually by talking to national spokesmen. This was perhaps one of the
                    most needed and important reportorial responsibilities we had because there were
                    a lot of customers back in Washington who were interested in the decisions that
                    would be made by the European Ministers there. The body we dealt with in
                    Brussels, to a great extent, was the European Commission. These were European
                    civil servants for want of a better way of describing them. They were
                    representing the EC rather than the countries from which they came. These were
                    our day-to-day contacts in trying to find out what the EC had in mind, what they
                    were up to and what they might be projecting for next year on the economic
                    front. The other point of contact for us there was the so-called perm reps (the
                    permanent representatives of the EC member countries) in Brussels. They were all
                    very large outfits. We tried to cultivate all of them to broaden our knowledge
                    of what was going on. The most interesting part of being assigned to the
                    political side in Brussels was the opportunity to go to meetings of the European
                    Parliament. These normally took place in Strasbourg, but every once in awhile
                    they were held in Luxembourg since Luxembourg was still the titular home of the
                    parliament. Everybody liked to go to Strasbourg because of the excellent
                    restaurants and the delicacy of white asparagus in the springtime. I thought one
                    of the more interesting developments in the EC at that time had been a study
                    commissioned by the member countries to define what is European Union. What
                    should a European Union look like and in essence - where do we want to go with
                    all this? By that time they had nine members. An expansion was coming but I'll
                    take that up in a little bit. There had not been any momentum toward a greater
                    degree of integration among the member countries for quite a while. What were
                    they going to do with all of this, and where did they want to go? That was
                    supposed to be explored in this report. A former Belgian prime minister, Leo
                    Tindemans, headed the project and his report was delivered about a year after I
                    arrived there. We examined it carefully for how it might reflect on U.S.
                    interests. There were a lot of cynics around who thought it signified very
                    little. I remember our ambassador at that time had a favorite expression to
                    describe what he considered flights of ideological fancy and pie in the sky -
                    “eurocrap.” This was Joe Greenwald, who was an excellent but realistic
                    ambassador. His successor probably had more hopes for what the European
                    community might become. That was Dean Hinton who was the ambassador during the
                    second half of my stay. One of the things I remember about this report - tucked
                    away in a rather long treatise - was a rather medium sized paragraph about
                    defense cooperation. Obviously, this was way ahead of its time, but the American
                    military was very sensitive to anything breathing the idea that the European
                    Community might somehow engage in defense cooperation. This, they thought, could
                    only lead to a diminution of the importance of NATO, and that bothered them. I'm
                    not sure whether we specifically rapped anybody on the knuckles at this time
                    over this but I'm sure later European visitors in Washington heard a lot along
                    the lines of, “You know, this is great but what does this mean for NATO?” This
                    issue is there, right down to today, because I get the impression that the U.S.
                    military right now is still as opposed to having the Europeans cooperate
                    militarily in any organized, effective way as they were 25 years ago. I find
                    this incredible but that's the way things are.</p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>Another thing that developed in Brussels at this time, which also made the
                    political section's work interesting, was what they call political cooperation.
                    This was a budding foreign policy coordination device which the Europeans
                    developed after an earlier report drafted by a Belgian foreign ministry
                    official, Devignon, who was looking for ways to deepen European cooperation and
                    came up with the thought of coordinating foreign policy. So political
                    cooperation - i.e., foreign policy coordination - became a rather standard part
                    of the landscape there. At a certain level the political directors of all the
                    foreign ministries would meet, either in Brussels or in member country capitals.
                    They would discuss whether they could work out or express a common EC-9 policy
                    on current issues of importance to them. As this EC practice developed, we
                    decided it would be to our interest to keep in close touch with them as a means
                    of avoiding surprises and perhaps influencing their policies before they were
                    finalized. Also at the time I was in Brussels we saw the beginning of the Greek
                    accession to the EC. This was the first step in expansion in the community since
                    1972 when the U.K., Ireland, and Denmark became members. By the time I arrived,
                    the Brits, the Irish, and Danes had been pretty well integrated into the
                    operation. With Greece, you had a country which had come out of the period of
                    military rule by army colonels and there was a feeling among EC-9 members that
                    they wanted to do something for Greece. They might be able to contribute some
                    measure of political stability if they encouraged Greece to move towards a
                    closer relationship with the EC. We followed this brief closely, and were very
                    much in favor of Greek association because we thought it contributed to
                    stability in this area of the Mediterranean. Another country in the
                    Mediterranean became a focus of EC attention. This was Portugal. With the
                    disappearance of the Salazar regime there was an interim period (three years or
                    so) when the government seemed to slip into the hands of left wing generals. We
                    were getting very concerned, as we read telegrams coming out of Lisbon. The EC
                    had a role here, which we encouraged, of urging moderation in Portugal and
                    holding out the possibility of closer relations with and eventually membership
                    in the EC. That period of instability in Portugal played out pretty much during
                    the time I was in Brussels. It had a happy ending of course and the Portugese
                    are members. The EC countries right down to today express their concern about
                    the lack of democracy in European countries as witness their refrigerating their
                    relations with EC member Austria when Haider's right wing party entered the
                    government.</p>
                <p>Q: Well, you got a well earned rest after Brussels and you were assigned to
                    Senior Officer Personnel. Do you have any overall comments on that period?</p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>JOHNSON: I think I can sum that up in a couple of sentences. Anybody who has done
                    that sort of work in the last 40 years would agree that it's thankless work. One
                    would try to do the right thing to help people out and to enforce some sort of
                    discipline over the process of assignment. Almost invariably you are defeated by
                    either the White House or the Bureaus who asserted their primacy in the
                    assignment process and wanted to call most of the shots. One of the things we
                    did was make the first-cut ambassadorial nomination lists and send it up to the
                    director general. It never ended up looking much like what we started out with.
                    But then sometimes you would get some nice surprises. Every once in a while you
                    were able to do something to help somebody. That would make you feel good.</p>
                <p>My return to Italy had its rancorous side. In this case, it was the Department
                    versus the ambassador - a class battle over prerogatives in the assignment
                    process. The post at stake was that of consul general in Milan, where the
                    incumbent had been there no less than six years and everybody was agreed on
                    moving him out. The ambassador, however, had his own choice, an officer in the
                    embassy's Political Section. However, the problem was his status as a political
                    officer. The post was a commercial interest post, meaning that the Department of
                    Commerce had veto power over the assignment. The Commerce Department opposed
                    sending a political officer there. So this tug-of-war began and went on and on.
                    I recused myself from the whole process, but one of my colleagues looked in my
                    file and saw I had been in Milan. He said, “I bet you would be acceptable to the
                    Commerce Department because you were there before and did all those good things
                    for them while you were there.” Before I knew it, they had called the Commerce
                    Department and the answer was, “Yes, indeed. He'd be great. We approve.” This
                    was all done before Ambassador Gardner had a further chance to weigh in. He
                    considered this an attack on his prerogatives and refused to accept anyone but
                    the man of his own choice. So the whole affair resolved into a duel between the
                    ambassador and the Director General, with each insisting on his own prerogatives
                    to fill the position in Milan, with me in the middle. It sputtered along through
                    the summer, with no one giving an inch. At a certain point the DCM in Rome came
                    back on home leave. His first stop was my office and he said, in effect, “You've
                    got to come. Gardner is happy with your assignment. He realizes now that the
                    Department isn't going to relent. He wants someone good in Milan and is
                    satisfied that, although he doesn't know you personally, you would fill the
                    bill. So please give it a shot.” So that's how I got there. I must say that
                    after I got to the post I developed a very good relationship with Dick Gardner.
                    Some people in Rome found him difficult to work for but my contacts with him
                    were very favorable and I thought he was an ideal American ambassador in Italy.
                    He spoke Italian well, he was prepared to go anywhere for speaking engagements,
                    you give him an audience and he would go out and answer all sorts of tough
                    questions from whomever, even when it involved a group of communist-oriented
                    students in Parma. He carried it off. He had a public relations concept of an
                    ambassador's role. That was a real plus at that point in Italy.</p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>Gardner was succeeded by Max Rabb as ambassador in Rome during the time I was in
                    Milan, perhaps a year or so later. Max Rabb had been in the White House during
                    the Eisenhower administration. I think he had been involved in some sort of
                    foreign policy coordination. After that he had returned to New York where he was
                    active in Republican politics - the liberal wing of the Party. The fact that he
                    was a Rockefeller Republican did not deter him from cooperating with the Reagan
                    folks in New York City. In fact, he turned out to be quite helpful. So when the
                    Reagan administration began looking at ambassadorial appointments, they saw Rabb
                    as somebody they would like to do something for and so they appointed him to
                    Rome as ambassador. Aside from the fact he had probably traveled in Italy at
                    various times, when he arrived he really didn't have a great deal of background
                    on Italy nor any language. But he was a very decent man. He made two or three
                    visits to Milan while I was there. He was quite willing to accede to invitations
                    by American groups in Milan to address them. He was generous with his time. And
                    if there were an invitation to come to the opening of La Scala in Milan, he
                    liked to do that. We liked that, too, since if the Rabbs came, my wife and I
                    also got to go to the opening. He was usually willing to do anything I suggested
                    when he came up there. He would appear at anything and this was very helpful.
                    Just the fact that you can produce an American ambassador means a lot in a city
                    like Milan, which is big, international, and is not necessarily impressed by
                    everything in the world. Still its nice to be able to introduce city councilmen
                    to the American ambassador. The local politicians were always very happy for a
                    chance to talk to him. The Socialists in Milan were very much on the upswing and
                    they were happy to have attention showered upon them.</p>

                <p>The Socialists under the leadership of Craxi, a Milanese, had been gaining in
                    National elections. They had a majority in the city of Milan and while Craxi
                    spent most of his time in Rome, I got to know in Milan what was called the
                    “Craxi Mafia,” including his relatives and other close collaborators in the
                    Socialist Party. I could get a pretty good fix on where the socialists were
                    going by keeping in close touch with these Milan types. In fact, I tried to keep
                    in touch with all elements of all political parties. The consul general usually
                    had no problems with access in Milan or I outside. I certainly spent a lot of
                    time visiting all of the Provinces in the consular district. By this time, many
                    former American consulates in northern Italy had been closed,such as Venice,
                    Trieste, and Turin. We were effectively the only American representation in
                    Northern Italy. There was a lot of interesting territory. One of the things I
                    really enjoyed about the job was the ability to go around and talk to Italians
                    and get some idea where they thought the country was going and what they thought
                    their future was. By this time something had changed about who we were allowed
                    to see. When I was in Italy in the '60s we were forbidden to call on any
                    communist mayors or communist provincial presidents. That policy had finally
                    been laid to rest, thank goodness, by the late '70s-early '80s. Every time I
                    would go to wherever, I would always schedule a visit with the Prefect, the
                    Province President, with the leaders of the principal parties, which would be
                    the DC, the PSI (the socialists) and the communists. The communists were pretty
                    interesting. They were bright. They didn't have horns. Sometimes they were a
                    little surprised that an American would come calling on them. They didn't expect
                    it. I found on a number of occasions that these guys were actually quite
                    nervous. You could even see their hands trembling a little because they had
                    never met an American before in this circumstance. Another aspect of Milan was
                    the fact that it put you in touch with the linguistic minority area in the Alto
                    Adige. Anybody who spoke German had an advantage in communicating there because
                    the official infrastructure was all German-speaking there. I never found it a
                    very interesting part of Italy but certainly the Italian government in Rome had
                    pretty much finessed the problem of absorption of a German-speaking area. They
                    did it largely by all the tax benefits they extended to these people. They got
                    more money back from Rome per capita than any province throughout the country.
                    This was designed to keep them quiet and they were quiet. Other things that had
                    changed from the 1960s. In the '80s, the embassy in Rome was delighted to have
                    the constituent posts do all sorts of reporting. There was no longer that
                    attitude. Now it was “We know best” and “We know it all” attitude toward the
                    consulates.Now it was, “We're happy to have your contributions and please keep
                    them coming.” With this encouragement, we did quite a lot of political reporting
                    based on our contacts in Milan. We had a longer leash in many ways in the 1980s
                    and closer cooperation with the embassy in Rome.</p>

                <p>I suppose this is the best time to mention one aspect of life in Italy at this
                    time that became, if not overwhelming, at least very important. This was the
                    existence of the Red Brigade movement plus another parallel organization called
                    “First Line (Prima Linea).” Since their birth in the late '60s, these groups had
                    gone through various organizational changes; they had certainly been the target
                    of all the security forces efforts to throttle them. But they weren't throttled
                    at all. They were very cleverly organized and Milan was a focal point of a lot
                    of Brigade activities. The Red Brigades were organized in groups known as
                    “columns” and there would be a column in Milan; there would be a column in
                    Padua; there would be a column in other cities, and one column was not supposed
                    to know anything about the next column. It made it very hard to crack. They were
                    so very secure themselves. During the time I was in Milan, the Brigades were
                    still attacking journalists; one heard of kneecapping - they were kneecapping
                    industrialists in Turin and they were murdering journalists. There was a young
                    fellow on the Corriere whom I had called on a number of times and I was
                    shattered to read about his murder on the streets of Milan a month after I had
                    seen him. One of the reasons that these groups were difficult to penetrate or to
                    combat was that the population in general was disinclined to get involved. They
                    were disinclined to express suspicions to the police about a suspicious person
                    who had just moved into their apartment building. The way these people operated
                    was they all rented apartments on the peripheries of the cities they were
                    operating in. They had people who supplied them with food. They were there, but
                    fellow residents were disinclined to get involved. In a way, this is a
                    manifestation of a larger Italian characteristic. When it comes to dealing with
                    the authorities, they are very reluctant to cooperate. The Italians have had
                    problems with authorities over the centuries, including Spanish authorities and
                    Austrian authorities, they just don't like authorities, particularly their own
                    Italian authorities. So the idea of going in and telling the “Carabiniere”
                    (Public Security Police) that there is a suspicious guy down the hall I don't
                    trust” - they wouldn't do anything. Toward the end of this period, there was the
                    beginnings of some public attitude changes. We began to witness events such as
                    occurred in the streets in Siena when 50,000 people marched to express their
                    horror over the fact that one of their fellow citizens who was a policeman had
                    been killed by the Red Brigade. So this was one of the things that began to
                    happen that marked the beginning of the end at this period. During the Red
                    Brigade period, up to a certain point there had never been any attack by the Red
                    Brigade on a non- Italian. This seemed to be a tabu, so while we all had our
                    security measures and devices in our apartments, no one really thought they
                    would ever attack an American citizen, an American official, an American
                    businessman. The American business community looked to me for advice on what
                    they should do. That all changed when in December 1981. An American general
                    attached to an Italian Army command in Verona went jogging on the banks of the
                    Adige River and returned to his apartment and found the Red Brigades waiting for
                    him. He had been told he shouldn't go out alone and jog by our security forces
                    but he did anyway. This was the beginning of a period where we all had to
                    examine what our lifestyle was and what we must do to protect ourselves and our
                    staff. Suddenly, somebody had taken the ground from beneath us. While the
                    investigation of the kidnaping was taken over by national police authorities, we
                    in Milan kept in close touch with local authorities, including General della
                    Chiesa, commander of the Carabiniere Division stationed in Milan. The general
                    had a national reputation for combating terrorism. Tragically, he was
                    subsequently named prefect for Sicily to combat the Mafia there, and fell victim
                    along with his wife to a Mafia ambush in the streets of Palermo. The search in
                    Milan was General Balakiasa, who was well known as a fighter of Mafia and Red
                    Brigades and was ultimately murdered by Mafia when he was made prefect of Sicily
                    after I left. There are a lot of important people in Milan whom one kept in
                    touch with. The search for clues to the fate of General Dozier continued. One
                    night the police recovered a list of targets of the Red Brigade and the police
                    told me that my name was on it. Once that happened, our security got even
                    tighter. I had a bodyguard 24 hours and 24 hour guards at the family apartment.
                    The wooden shades on our apartment windows had to be locked every night to
                    forestall breaking and entering. We still had one son with us at that time in
                    Milan and he was attending the American School of Milan some 12 miles away in
                    the south part of the city. He liked to play sports and sometimes there was the
                    question of coming home late - no activities bus. So he had to take a public
                    tram home. We let him do this a couple of times but went through agonies
                    worrying about him. Fortunately, the Red Brigades never targeted family
                    members.</p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>During the time I was there they did locate and liberate General Dozier. Because
                    of improved police work and increasing use by the Italian Judicial Authorities
                    of plea bargaining (which permitted reduced sentences to terrorists who would
                    talk). Some of these captured Brigade people began to talk and from leads police
                    were drawn to the north. The Rome Brigade people surmised that the hiding place
                    might be in northeast Italy. Through good police work, the Italians concluded
                    that Padua was the likely place. They tagged an apartment and in a well-executed
                    operation captured an apartment filled with Brigadists - and General Dozier. So
                    Dozier was freed and we all drew whatever lessons we could from that but
                    certainly the tight security kept up long after I left there. Bit-by-bit the
                    Brigades lost their force. A couple of years after my departure they were no
                    longer viable.The Italians love to commemorate just about everything -
                    anniversaries, births, weddings, deaths, and famous Italians. One of the
                    organizations in Milan wanted to do honor to Christopher Columbus. They sought
                    my help and asked if I could possibly induce the ambassador to come for the
                    event set for Columbus Day. We managed to put together a major event celebrating
                    the legendary Italian explorer. Ambassador Rabb was happy to attend and I also
                    arranged for the attendance of Egidio Ortona, now retired from Italian diplomacy
                    but for many years one of the ablest ambassadors in Washington. Ortona spoke,
                    Rabb spoke, and I spoke. My speech was actually very carefully thought out. On
                    Columbus Day, I wanted to say something constructive about the Italians. In
                    fact, I criticized their tendency to be self-critical and downplay their natural
                    profile. I was astonished at the reaction. They really loved it and since it
                    came close to the end of my assignment there, it was in a way a nice way to say
                    “Goodbye.”</p>
