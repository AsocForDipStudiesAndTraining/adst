                <p>Interviewed by: Richard Nethercut </p>
                <p>Initial interview date: August 27, 1990</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This interview is being conducted with Ambassador,
                        Retired, George Lane on August 27, 1990 at Ambassador Lane's home in
                        Westminster, Massachusetts. The interview is one in a series being conducted
                        as part of the senior officer project of The Association for Diplomatic
                        Studies. The interviewer is, a retired Foreign Service Officer. The purpose
                        of this interview is to provide background on Ambassador Lane's career in
                        the Foreign Service, and on the experiences in the Mid- East which was his
                        special area of interests.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>To begin with, Ambassador Lane, would you give us a brief description of your
                    career in the Foreign Service?</p>
                <p>LANE: Okay. I entered the Foreign Service in September of 1957 out of the
                    Fletcher School where I had spent a year, and spent the first two and a half
                    years in Washington as a glorified office boy in the office of European Regional
                    Affairs working on the OECD as it was then. I learned a lot working with some
                    people who had very distinguished careers later on in the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>I went to Beirut in early 1960 and spent two years there studying Arabic and
                    completed that course. I then spent basically the next eight years in the Arab
                    world: two years in Saudi Arabia as a Commercial Officer; two years in Aleppo,
                    Syria as an Economic Officer; two years in Morocco—in Rabat—as a Political
                    Officer; and then two years in Benghazi, Libya as the Principal Officer in what
                    was then the Embassy branch office. Then I went back to the States, for a four
                    year tour as it turned out; two years as a Personnel Officer in the Bureau of
                    African Affairs; then two years working on North African Affairs. In 1974 I was
                    assigned to Swaziland, an out of area assignment. I was “glopped”, as Henry
                    Kissinger used to say at the time. I spent two years as the Charg�, basically,
                    and then Resident DCM in our Embassy in Mbabane, Swaziland. From there I was
                    transferred to Beirut, after Ambassador Frank Meloy was assassinated. I went
                    into Beirut, first as Charg� for about six months, and then as the DCM to
                    Ambassador Dick Parker for about a year and a half.</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>In 1978 I was appointed Ambassador in Yemen, (North Yemen, the Yemen Arab
                    Republic) and was there from '78 to '81; '81 to '82 I was Diplomat in Residence
                    at Portland State University in Oregon. From '82 until I retired in January of
                    '86 I was the Political Adviser to the Deputy Commander in Chief of the United
                    States European Command at Stuttgart, Germany. To use the military acronym I was
                    the POLAD to the DCINC at EUCOM.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you tell me what attracted you toward a career in
                        foreign affairs in the first place?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LANE: I think probably it was largely the family I grew up in. My father was a
                    medieval historian, and his field of interest was Venice. He was a great expert
                    on the economic history of Venice. So I grew up in a house where there was a lot
                    of talk and discussion about activities overseas, and world politics. My father
                    was always interested in political activity in general. I frankly hadn't
                    realized that I had decided, or had been thinking about a Foreign Service career
                    so early. But I was talking with an old high school friend of mine not too long
                    ago about this, and somebody asked me that question and I said, “Oh, I don't
                    know.” And he said, “I could tell you when, George, it was in high school
                    because in the high school yearbook all those pictures they have of us, you
                    know, and ambitions...” Under my picture apparently it says, my ambition was “to
                    be a diplomat.” So I guess I'd been thinking about a Foreign Service-type career
                    for a long time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How long after you got into the Foreign Service was it
                        that you made the decision to get into Arabic training?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LANE: Well, when I joined the Foreign Service I decided that I wanted to work in
                    the developing part of the world, that I wanted to work someplace around the
                    Mediterranean basin, and I wanted to learn a language that would be useful in
                    more than one country. The idea of learning Turkish, for example, which would
                    sort of imply that I would spend most of my career either in Turkey or in the
                    U.S., seemed to restricting. So if you look at those three conditions, one of
                    the natural things to do would be to study Arabic. So I decided to volunteer for
                    the Arabic Language School. All of my friends in EUR, where I was working at the
                    time, told me I was crazy, because as a junior officer I'd been very lucky. They
                    said I could spend the rest of my career in going from Washington, to Paris, to
                    Brussels, to Bonn, to London and back to Washington, but I haven't really
                    regretted it (the decision to study Arabic).</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Instead you opted for a career in the Mid-East and
                        following language school in Lebanon were immediately put into some rather
                        challenging sounding assignments in Jeddah, and Aleppo Syria, and then
                        Morocco. Could you tell me your impressions then, after the two years in
                        Beirut, and these three successive assignments? How did you view the Arab
                        world at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>LANE: I didn't have any early special affinity, I don't think, for Arab culture
                    or anything like that. I viewed it, I suppose, to be perfectly honest as a place
                    to work, as a fascinating new area of the world, something very new. Saudi
                    Arabia was just taking off at that point in the early '60s. The oil business in
                    Saudi Arabia really exploded right after World War II, but the tremendous
                    amounts of money were just beginning to show in Saudi Arabia. You could still
                    see parts of old Jeddah, and the American Embassy compound was five miles out of
                    town. Now it's buried in the middle of Jeddah, what is left of it. It was a
                    fascinating assignment. I was Commercial Officer so my job was to run around and
                    see as many of the business people as I could, and get them interested in
                    representing American products, and helping out American businessmen who came to
                    town. But I suppose the most interesting activity that I was involved in, in
                    Jeddah, was being the liaison escort officer for the first American destroyer
                    ever to visit the port of Yanbu. You hear a lot about Yanbu these days because
                    it's the outlet for a pipeline from the oil fields in the Persian Gulf that goes
                    all the way across the Arabian Peninsula and comes out in what is now a very
                    modern port city of Yanbu—which I haven't seen since 1962. But in 1962 it was
                    much as it had been for a thousand years. It's a long complicated story, so I
                    won't go into it, but trying to be the escort officer for that destroyer was a
                    real happening. Saudi Arabia was an interesting place to work at that time. It
                    was very tough on the family. The climate in Jeddah is almost as bad as the
                    climate in the Persian Gulf, but not quite.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then were your subsequent assignments in Syria and Morocco
                        more hospitable in terms of climate?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LANE: Interestingly enough the assignment in Aleppo was much more hospitable in
                    terms of climate. In terms of general physical ambience, Aleppo was a charming
                    city, one of the most fascinating old cities in the world with miles and miles
                    of underground passages, the old souk, the old market which had been there since
                    Crusader times. But we got there in 1964, which was a year after the Baath
                    Revolution in 1963 in Syria, so politically it was a time when Americans were
                    not popular— particularly official Americans were looked on with great
                    suspicion. It was in a sense, just the opposite of Saudi Arabia. In Saudi Arabia
                    the political ambience was very friendly. The Saudis were happy to have us
                    there, and there was no problem doing your job at all. But the climate was
                    terrible. In Syria the climate was very pleasant, fascinating things to see and
                    do. But politically it was very tough to try to go around and see people. If as
                    Economic Officer, I went to call on somebody I had to leave behind some
                    brochures from some American company because otherwise the secret police, who
                    would always follow me, and who would call on whoever I called on right after I
                    left, would want to know why that person was consorting with the American
                    Embassy—the American Consulate representatives. So that was a bit unpleasant as
                    far as working conditions were concerned.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then Morocco?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>LANE: Rabat was much better in the sense that the political situation was not
                    unfriendly as it was in Syria, although the Moroccans are a very closed people.
                    It's not very easy to get into Moroccan society, or to get to know people very
                    well in Morocco. But it's a fascinating country; a combination of desert, and
                    seashore. It combines both the African and Arab cultures, for example Fez, which
                    is so Arab, and Marrakech, which is largely African. A nice place to live. My
                    job there in the Political Section was to try to keep track of the opposition.
                    Of course, King Hassan was not terribly pleased to have American Embassy
                    officers running around talking to people who were opposed to what he was doing.
                    But I was so low down on the totem pole that it didn't really make much
                    difference from that point of view.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I notice that you are both fluent in French, plus this
                        training in Arabic. Did you find that, say at a post like Morocco, that you
                        could establish more rapport in one particular language or another?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LANE: Yes. Basically, French was more useful in Morocco than Arabic was, because
                    my Arabic was eastern Arabic—basically Palestinian, Lebanese type Arabic, which
                    was useful in Syria without much difficulty, and quite useful in Saudi Arabia.
                    But in Morocco, the spoken dialect was very, very different. So that really the
                    only people that I spoke Arabic with on a regular basis were the members of the
                    Istiqlal Party, which was very self-consciously Arab, as opposed to European or
                    French, and the leaders of that party were very well educated in Arabic and
                    therefore could adjust to my eastern Arabic, and adjust their own Arabic so I
                    could understand it. But they didn't like to speak French. With the diplomatic
                    corps, and with most people in the Moroccan government who had been French
                    educated, French was the language we used.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In that series of assignments, including the language
                        training in Lebanon, what perspective did you have of Israel?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LANE: Israel was a constant problem in the sense that obviously since the
                    creation of the State of Israel, the United States had been the number one
                    friend and supporter of Israel. Our military support for Israel didn't really
                    start until after 1967. So that in this period we're talking about—although the
                    '67 war occurred while I was in Morocco- -it wasn't that the U.S. was a major
                    supplier of military equipment to Israel because we weren't at that point. But
                    it was well understood that the United States was Israel's best friend, and as
                    far as most of the Arab countries were concerned, Israel was the number one
                    enemy. So this was a constant problem in terms of our trying to build closer
                    relations with any Arab country.</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>Now, it was more or less of a problem depending on how important the Arab-Israeli
                    problem was to the host government. For example, with the Syrians, it was a
                    major problem. Had the United States policy towards Israel been different, our
                    relationship with Syria might have been very different because it was a very
                    major issue in U.S.-Syrian relations. In U.S.-Saudi relations, less so but still
                    important. There was hardly any problem with Saudi relations other than Israel.
                    With Morocco, probably least of all. Partly geographic, the Moroccans are an
                    awfully long way from Palestine, and they really are not that concerned about
                    the Palestinian problem in general. So, that they would pay lip service to it on
                    the international political scale, and it was certainly a negative in our
                    relationship, but it wasn't really a major problem.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In that connection, at these different assignments, did
                        you develop a view of the Arab League and the extent to which that was a
                        political factor in these countries, the extent to which Arab League seem to
                        be moving toward unity, or just unity?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LANE: No, I don't think the Arab League as an organization really counted much at
                    all. It just wasn't a factor.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your next assignment, after Morocco, was in Libya at the
                        time that of the Libyan revolution. Could you comment on that in terms of
                        your experience there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LANE: Yes. We were hoping to spend a third year in Morocco. We hadn't had any
                    three year assignments overseas, and as you know two years is just about the
                    minimum time to really feel like your working at the maximum. But suddenly,
                    after we'd been in Morocco for two years, I got one of these calls from
                    Personnel, “You're the only man available, George, and you've got to do this. We
                    need somebody to take over the Embassy Office in Benghazi, Libya.” So suddenly I
                    was transferred to Benghazi in 1968, and was there for about a year before the
                    revolution— before Qadhafi's revolution—during the revolution, and then for
                    about a year afterwards.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I notice that you referred to it as the U.S. Embassy
                        Office. What's the distinction between that and a full-fledged Embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LANE: At this time King Idriss was on the throne in Libya. And King Idriss' basic
                    home area was Cyrenaica, the area where Benghazi and Baida are located. So when
                    the government sort of moved to Tripoli partly for political reasons, and partly
                    for, I think, sentimental reasons, he maintained Benghazi as a co-capital and
                    started building a new capital up in the so-called Jebel Akhdar, the Green
                    Mountain area. So there were really three capitals in Libya at this point.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And the Embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>LANE: The Ambassador and the main part of the Embassy were in Tripoli, where they
                    had always been. But technically, rather than being a Consulate, Benghazi was a
                    branch Embassy, as was Baida where there was one officer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At Benghazi then, how did that get involved in the Libyan
                        revolution? Or how did that affect your job there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LANE: Well, very dramatically, of course. Under King Idriss the people running
                    Libya were really the Shalhi brothers; the two sons of the man who had been the
                    number one counselor and adviser to King Idriss, and who had been murdered by
                    other members of King Idriss' family. He was so angry when they assassinated his
                    adviser Ibrahim Shalhi, that he made these two sons, rather than exile them, he
                    made them his favorites. So that the Crown Prince, who was a nephew, was largely
                    ignored and these two brothers were almost running the country. One of them was
                    a colonel in the Signal Corps—a colonel in the Libyan military—he ran the Signal
                    Corps; and the other one was really Mr. Five Percent, who had a finger in every
                    commercial, economic deal that was going on in Libya. And there were a lot of
                    them at that time because, of course, oil had been discovered in 1956, I think,
                    and the oil boom was really going at this point in 1968. Armand Hammer, and
                    Occidental Petroleum, were very active. It was not only the majors, it was the
                    independents, and they were all going full blast with the oil business. And then
                    King Idriss, in the summer of 1969, went off to take the baths in Turkey—in
                    Bursa, I think. Everybody thought that these two young men, Omar and Abd al Aziz
                    Shalhi, were going to pull a coup, and then the King was going to abdicate, and
                    they would take over the government.</p>
                <p>Apparently a 27-year-old First Lieutenant, Muammar Qadhafi heard this rumor also,
                    so he decided to move up the timing for his coup which he'd been thinking about
                    doing ever since he'd been in the military academy. And so, on the first of
                    September, 1969 there was a sudden—I guess you'd have to call it a coup
                    d'etat—simultaneously in Tripoli and Benghazi. And for two weeks nobody knew who
                    was in charge. Qadhafi was very shrewd, and he knew that if he immediately
                    announced that as a 27- year-old First Lieutenant he was taking over the
                    country, opposition would spring up everywhere. So he passed the word initially
                    that somebody else was behind the coup—spread a rumor—that it was a Libyan
                    colonel, who was—I think he was then the Libyan Military Attach� in Rome—who was
                    then on vacation. When the world press tracked him down he said he didn't know a
                    thing about the coup, he didn't know what they were talking about. But by
                    spreading this kind of rumor, Qadhafi gave himself some time, and he and his
                    revolutionary command council primarily, Abd Al Salam Jallud, who was number
                    two, succeeded in arresting, or nullifying all the possible areas of opposition.
                    So he was able to take over the country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What time frame does this—what years?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>LANE: This is the first of September, 1969; from the first of September until
                    about the 15th nobody knew who was in charge. Many of us diplomatic corps in
                    Benghazi were meeting with somebody who had been a Lt. Colonel, we could tell,
                    but he'd ripped all the insignia off his uniform when he met with us because
                    those ranks, of course, no longer meant anything as far as the new revolutionary
                    government was concerned, plus, of course, as we learned later, he outranked his
                    leader, and you can't have that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So that meant that for about eight or nine months you were
                        there after the coup d'etat, and while Qadhafi had acquired power, did that
                        bring you into contact with him? Or affect your work there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LANE: Well, it's funny, my first contact with Qadhafi was an interesting one. On
                    the morning of the revolution, they, of course, announced a curfew, and they had
                    taken over the TV station—in modern revolutions the first place you have to take
                    control of is the TV stations, and that's where the revolutionary command
                    council was meeting. So I decided I'd better go down there, and see if I
                    couldn't get a pass which would enable me to move around during curfew hours
                    because there were a lot of Americans working in eastern Libya in the Benghazi
                    consular area in the oil fields. Tripoli was the headquarters for the American
                    oil companies, but Benghazi was the headquarters for the roughnecks, and the
                    guys that did the work in the oil fields, and if any of them got in trouble in
                    this rather dicey situation, I was going to need something that would enable me
                    to move around. So I drove down through innumerable fourteen year olds with
                    Kalashnikovs trying to figure out what I was doing, to the headquarters of the
                    TV station. And there was a first lieutenant standing out front directing
                    traffic, and I went up to him and explained in my best Arabic who I was, and
                    what I wanted, and that I needed to go inside, that I needed to get a pass so
                    that I could move around and take care of American citizens, that was my
                    responsibility as the man in charge of the Embassy Office in Benghazi. And he
                    said, “I don't know anything about that.” And I said, “Can you tell me where I
                    should go to find out?” He said, “No, I don't know anything about that.” So I
                    was getting kind of desperate, and I said, “Can you tell me your name?” And he
                    said, “Yes, my name is Muammar Qadhafi.” And it was as I found out later, it was
                    Qadhafi himself who was out directing traffic, and, of course, keeping an eye on
                    what was going on, while the people who were really his subordinates, were
                    inside trying to make policy for the new Revolutionary Command Council.</p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>But very soon after that, Qadhafi, who had been in the Benghazi area during the
                    coup—he had run the coup in Benghazi, and Jallud had run the coup in Tripoli—but
                    very soon after that Qadhafi moved to Tripoli, where he took over the
                    government, and started negotiating with Joe Palmer who was our Ambassador there
                    at the time—well, first it was Jim Blake who was the Charg�, and then Joe
                    Palmer, about the evacuation of Wheelus. So I didn't see Qadhafi very much in
                    those nine months after the revolution because I was still in Benghazi, and he
                    was in Tripoli. But, of course, it affected our operations enormously. During
                    the time when King Idriss was on the throne, U.S. and Libya had very close
                    relations. I think frankly our CIA people were declared to the Libyan
                    government, which, of course, caused all sorts of consternation when the
                    revolution took place and Qadhafi's people took over control of the files of the
                    Libyan government. You can imagine some of the brouhaha that went on as a result
                    of that.</p>
                <p>But after Qadhafi's revolution came in, of course, then the Americans changed
                    very quickly from being the number one friend, to the number one enemy. Because
                    Qadhafi was motivated very much by two things: by a sense of Arab socialism as
                    personified by Jamal Abd Al Nasser, who was his absolute hero; and a little bit
                    of Islamic revivalism fundamentalism in the great tradition of the Arab
                    reformers who sweep out of the desert to sweep away the corrupt people in the
                    cities. You can see this in Morocco with Ibn Tunbal, in Saudi Arabia with
                    Muhammad Ibn Abd Al Wahhab, and even in Libya with the Sanoussi. That was really
                    a part of the Sanoussi movement.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now this early contact with Qadhafi must be unique in the
                        Foreign Service, and I wonder what you would conclude from what has happened
                        subsequently involving Libya, and the way in which Qadhafi has become almost
                        personified as the arch enemy, and the way in which we have been responded
                        to him, including the attack on Libya. Do you have some comments on
                        that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LANE: Yes. I claim to be one of the original Qadhafi watchers, and I've, of
                    course, been fascinated by keeping track of him ever since 1969. I've been in
                    other countries that he's visited, and in other places where its been fairly
                    easy to keep track. Qadhafi, of course, is not crazy. I really find it sad that
                    leading American politicians, and commentators, like to call our enemies crazy.
                    It's an intellectual cop-out. If you don't want to spend the time and energy to
                    think about why he's doing what's he's doing, and what are his motivations, then
                    you just sit back and say, “Well, he's nuts.” And that means you don't have to
                    think about it.</p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>Well, of course, from Qadhafi's point of view, he's erratic. He does some unusual
                    things, he's not your average man. Your average man doesn't make a coup when
                    he's 27 years old. He's a very unusual character. But to say he's crazy, is an
                    intellectual cop-out. He became, of course, the great Beelzebub, particularly
                    for the Reagan administration, although he'd caused us lots of troubles before
                    that. It was one of those apocryphal stories, I guess, that Qadhafi was supposed
                    to have said after Nasser died, “Egypt is a country without a leader, and I am a
                    leader without a country.” As you know, he spent years trying to figure out ways
                    to unite Libya with other countries to build a unified Arab state. He initially
                    tried to unify immediately with Nasser's Egypt, and I suspect sometimes the
                    Egyptians wish they'd taken him up on it, because they could have swallowed
                    Libya very fast, I think, if they'd played their cards right. But, of course,
                    Nasser died in 1970, and then Qadhafi sort of went off on his own trying to
                    unite his country with various other Arab countries, trying to push himself as
                    the heir of Jamal Nasser's, the only true believer, the one who is carrying the
                    flame for Arab nationalism, the only true supporter of the Palestinians.</p>
                <p>One of the reasons that he attracted so much attention in the United States, was
                    that the American media made such a play for him. I can remember pictures of Ted
                    Koppel, or some such person, interviewing Qadhafi as he drives a tractor through
                    some part of Libya plowing up the soil to create a new green area. He loved that
                    sort of thing. He got a lot of publicity, and he made a lot of outrageous
                    statements. And that raid on Libya did not stop his support for what we called
                    terrorism. What it did was to stop him from talking about it. I think that's
                    what he learned; that is, it's silly to shoot your mouth off all the time
                    because then you attract attention. There was an article in the Christian
                    Science Monitor just a couple of weeks ago saying there's considerable evidence
                    that Qadhafi's support of terrorism is just as strong, or more so, in the last
                    three years than it was before that raid on his headquarters, which killed some
                    innocent people, and some people in the French Embassy, as I recall.</p>

                        that a triangle, or a mini-alliance, that has had some historical

                    for Israel. If Israel is your number one enemy, then you're looking around for
                    somebody else who has the same enemy that you have. And that's what they have in
                    common. The enemy of my enemy is my friend.</p>

                        concerned North Africa, and the Libyan, and Algerian desk. Is there any more
                        to add? Did you get a new perspective working in the State Department? What
                        would be your thoughts on that assignment?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LANE: I was the Libyan Desk Officer for a while, and the Algerian Desk Officer
                    for a while. As far as Libya is concerned, this was a period where under the
                    monarchy Libya had bought a number of C- 130s, and the U.S. didn't want to send
                    them to Qadhafi because, of course, we had immediate problems with Qadhafi over
                    the evacuation of Wheelus Air Base. He threw out the Peace Corps, which was very
                    prominent in Libya before that. So he was doing a lot of things that the U.S.
                    Government didn't like. So the U.S. GOVERNMENT tried to find ways to avoid
                    sending these airplanes that the Libyans had bought and paid for, to Libya. And
                    the Libyans, of course, very much wanted them. So this was one of the issues
                    that was on top of the agenda. I think even the Secretary was involved in that,
                    as he was in the question of whether or not we were going to put a stamp in
                    American passports that had Arabic in it because Qadhafi said, “I'm not going to
                    let anymore people come into Libya if the only thing in their passports is
                    English. Why English? Why not Arabic? Our language is as good as your language.”
                    And we had never done that before, so the issue became whether or not the United
                    States was going to put an Arabic stamp in American passports so our people
                    could go in and out of Libya, or whether we were simply not going to send any
                    more people to Libya. And eventually we put the stamp in the passport. Dr.
                    Kissinger decided we'd do that. So we did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I notice that after your tour in the Department, you were
                        for a period Charg� at our Embassy in Mbabane, Swaziland in Southern Africa
                        which would be your first Charg� experience. And then that was followed by a
                        quick transfer to a similar position in our Embassy in Beirut. Could you
                        explain how that came about?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>LANE: Well, it may have been a similar position in name, but it was very, very
                    different in fact. While I was in Swaziland, when I was first sent there, the
                    so-called BLS countries—Botswana, Lesotho, and Swaziland—each had a resident
                    Charg�. While I was there, the Department named an Ambassador who was resident
                    in Botswana, but who was the Ambassador to all three posts, Dave Bolen. So my
                    job there was sort of DCM for three-quarters of the time—no, DCM one-quarter of
                    the time, and Charg� for three-quarters of the time. It was, again, a very small
                    post, like Benghazi three or four officers. It was basically showing the flag.
                    There were only about seven countries represented in Swaziland, a fascinating
                    little country. I think Swaziland itself is smaller than the Krueger Park, the
                    great game park in South Africa, and the population was about 500,000 people.
                    But it was an experiment in multi-racialism, which was importance because there
                    were some primarily British people, whites, who had lived there for a long, long
                    time, and who had decided when Swaziland became independent to stay and become
                    Swazis. So they were Swazi citizens, they were white Swazis, with very British
                    background. All our children went to the Waterford School which was a dramatic
                    example of trying to create a multi-racial co-educational school in Southern
                    Africa where the land was given by King Sobhuza, and the school was designed
                    free by a famous Portuguese architect, and various British philanthropic
                    organizations put up the money. The student body was white South Africans, and
                    black South Africans, and colored South Africans, and Swazis, and whites from
                    various diplomatic groups and economic missions, and people from Malawi, and
                    they were all mixed together in classes, and all studying a very rigorous
                    program to prepare them for the British A- levels.</p>
                <p>Then, again, while we were hoping for a third year in Swaziland—a pleasant place
                    to live and work—there was the sudden assassination of Frank Meloy and Bob
                    Waring in Beirut, and the Department sent me a telegram ordering me back to
                    Washington on consultations. In fact, it was a flash telegram. I claim to be the
                    only Officer in the Foreign Service who ever got consultation orders by flash
                    telegram.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you just elaborate when you said Frank Meloy and
                        Waring. Could you identify their positions in the Embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LANE: Frank Meloy was the Ambassador who had quite recently been assigned to
                    Beirut. And Bob Waring was the Economic Counselor. He'd been there for quite a
                    long time, and was very well connected with a lot people in Lebanon and was
                    therefore the Ambassador's right hand man as he was learning his way around.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were then sent as Charg� d'Affaires. Had there been a
                        Deputy Chief of Mission at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>LANE: What happened actually was, that I was ordered back to Washington on
                    consultation, as was another officer, because as I understood it, the Secretary,
                    that is, Dr. Kissinger, hadn't quite made up his mind whether or not he was
                    going to close the post entirely, or whether he was going to try to keep the
                    Embassy open in spite of the civil war that was then going on in Lebanon, and in
                    spite of this disaster—this tragedy—with our Ambassador and Economic Counselor.
                    The first person to go to head the mission was Talcott Seelye. Talcott Seelye
                    was at that point Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs. I
                    think he was traveling in Africa, and he went in, I think, within about 48 hours
                    just as a symbolic gesture to show that we were not going to be driven out of
                    Lebanon by the assassination of our Ambassador. But it was a stop-gap measure
                    because it was understood that Talcott was not going to go in as Ambassador. He
                    had just taken on his AF responsibility, he had other things to do. But the
                    question was, what do we do now with our Embassy in Beirut, having suffered this
                    tragedy. So having gone back to Washington at breakneck speed in response to the
                    flash telegram, and left Swaziland, of course, without saying goodbye to
                    anybody, not even anybody in the Foreign Ministry, never mind anybody else in
                    the diplomatic corps, or the general society, and with instructions not to tell
                    anybody where I might be going next, I then sat in Washington for two weeks
                    cooling my heels, and trying to read in on the Lebanese situation in case I was
                    going to go. While the decision and the argument went back and forth, should we
                    keep an Embassy open just as a presence to enable us to talk to some people in
                    the Lebanese situation, or was it not worth it, should we simply close the
                    Embassy and pull out. This argument went on for two weeks, as I understand it.
                    Larry Eagleburger would be able to tell you a lot more about this than I
                    can.</p>
                <p>During this period, the situation got worse in Lebanon. It was impossible to get
                    in by air because the airport was closed. It was impossible to get in by sea,
                    and the overland route was very frequently blocked by the fighting between
                    Damascus and Beirut, along that route. I can't remember the dates exactly, but
                    it must have been mid-July—late July—President Ford then ordered the second
                    evacuation of Americans from Beirut—of American civilians. Of course, we had a
                    lot of people living and working in Beirut. It was the central place for all
                    sorts of American businessmen, and media. A lot of them had gone out in the
                    earlier evacuation in June, but some had stayed, and some had even come back. So
                    the second evacuation was ordered for July, and the USG suddenly realized that
                    if they were going to send somebody in to be the Charg�, this was the time
                    because it wouldn't be possible perhaps even to get anybody in if they didn't do
                    it then. So it was a typical hurry-up and wait kind of a thing. It was hurry-up,
                    and then wait, and then hurry- up again because they called me up on Saturday
                    and said, “Be ready to go in three hours.” The reason, I think, I was chosen was
                    that the other fellow had been told—as I had been told—that we could both go
                    away for the weekend, because no decision would be made. But I had decided not
                    to come up here (to Westminster, Mass.) for the weekend because I didn't think
                    there was time. So rather than do that I just stayed where I was in Washington.
                    So I was available Saturday night. So I was the guy they sent.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LANE: What happened was, that I went from Washington to Athens by commercial
                    airline, from Athens to a U.S. aircraft carrier by Cob aircraft—it landed on the
                    aircraft carrier; from the aircraft carrier to the landing ship by helicopter,
                    and from the landing ship into Beirut—Bain Militaire—by landing craft (LST). I
                    went in on the landing craft that was evacuating all the people coming out from
                    the Bain Militaire area of Beirut. So there I was in my civilian clothes sitting
                    on six pouch bags full of communication equipment which I was carrying in, with
                    all these Navy guys in their flak suits and not sure what they were going to run
                    into going into Beirut because at this point the State Department had organized
                    the security on the beach with the PLO. The PLO was the organization that really
                    had more control over West Beirut than any other organization. So, in fact, we
                    worked with the PLO to organize the security so that the American civilians, who
                    were moving to this area to get on the landing ship, wouldn't be shot at. That
                    was one of our few examples of cooperation with the PLO.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was quite a baptism under fire in arriving at your
                        first time as the Charg� in Beirut. Could you tell me how you established
                        yourself, and how you conducted relations with the Lebanese authorities, or
                        whoever were the persons that you ended up dealing with?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LANE: Yes. This was a time when we were operating with a real skeleton staff, if
                    you'll pardon the expression, in Beirut. All dependents had been evacuated from
                    the Embassy staff, and we cut down to the bare minimum, we thought, to keep the
                    Embassy going including four Marine Guards and a Gunny. So we did have Marine
                    Guards standing watch at all times. But we all lived, worked, and ate in the
                    Embassy—in the chancellery building—for about six months, from about August of
                    1976 until about February 1977. For the first month, Ray Hunt was there and he
                    outranked me, and so he was the Charg�. But then the road to Damascus opened,
                    and he was able to get out. So basically from the end of August until February
                    '77 when Dick Parker came in and took over as Ambassador, I was the Charg�. And
                    it was very difficult to establish any kind of contact with the official
                    authorities in Lebanon because Beirut was split right down the middle by the
                    so-called green line. The U.S. Embassy was located in West Beirut where the
                    Muslim and Palestinian factions were in control. So the only people that I could
                    go to see were basically the opponents of the government—the opponents of the
                    president.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The president at that time was...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>LANE: ...was Elias Sarkis. Sarkis had just taken over as president during this
                    period. In fact, Ambassador Meloy was on his way to see president-elect Sarkis
                    of Lebanon when he was killed. Actually I think Sarkis took over in September
                    officially but he'd been elected earlier. So everybody knew he was going to be
                    the president, and the fellow who was actually in the office, Suleiman Franjieh,
                    was a lame duck. Everybody wanted him to retire, resign, so Sarkis, who looked
                    like a peacemaker could take over, but Suleiman Franjieh absolutely refused to
                    do so and stayed on until the very last day of his mandate.</p>
                <p>So what I did for the first several months at least, was go around and
                    occasionally visit the leading Lebanese political figures who were available in
                    the West Beirut. I did not initially try to cross that green line, which was
                    where Ambassador Frank Meloy and Bob Waring had been killed. Actually, I think
                    it was Christmas time of '76 I came home on leave—I managed to come out—and Bob
                    Houghton came over and sat in for me for a while. It was also during this period
                    when Bob Houghton and David Mack conducted a special mission out of Cyprus to
                    visit the Christian leaders in East Beirut, because I wasn't able to get across
                    to see them at that point.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So it was easier to go from Cyprus to East Beirut than it
                        was to go from West Beirut to East Beirut?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LANE: Exactly. Things improved towards the end of 1976. The Syrians came
                    in—beginning really in June of '76—the Syrians started moving very slowly in
                    taking control of various parts of Lebanon. And by the end of '76 they had
                    established a kind of order, and there was a kind of truce. We thought the
                    destruction that had gone on in late '76-'75 when it all started, April '75, was
                    just horrendous, and things couldn't be worse, but they got steadily worse. In
                    fact, my wife and I often reminisce that our life there, when she finally came
                    out to join me in February of '77, from then until about July of '78 when we
                    left, was really fairly pleasant. There were a lot of places we could go, a lot
                    of places we couldn't, and were occasionally snipers would shoot at us. But
                    compared to what has happened in Lebanon since, and what happened before, it
                    really now in retrospect was the moment of calm and sanity compared to what has
                    gone on since then.</p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>During that time—it must have been early '77, January of '77 perhaps—when I
                    finally did get permission from the Department to make a trip across the green
                    line, and go visit myself some of the leaders, President Sarkis, ex-president
                    Franjieh, former president Chamoun, and various other Christian leaders. But
                    during that initial period in Beirut I used to say that I had the best private
                    army in Lebanon, because after the assassination of the previous Ambassador, of
                    course, all sorts of security precautions had been beefed up. I was the only one
                    really who got to leave the Embassy, and that was almost always only on official
                    calls. I always traveled in a bullet proof car—an armored car with a lead car,
                    and a follow car with four or five body guards in each car, carefully recruited
                    from the elite of Lebanese security forces—one Druze, one Greek Orthodox, one
                    Sunni, one Shia all the religions were represented in case we got into a
                    situation where there was a religious problem there would be a co-religionist of
                    each of the groups in Lebanon who was part of my team. One guy was the former
                    karate champion of Lebanon, one was a weight-lifting champion of Lebanon, one
                    was a famous member of their riot squad who had a patented technique for
                    rendering people unconscious with one blow. It was quite a group.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you ever threatened? Was there ever an attempt to
                        attack you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LANE: Not me, as me. I mean there were a couple of cases where I got fired at by
                    snipers. There was at least one case where a stray 50 calibre round came sailing
                    through the wooden shutter on the edge of the window of the apartment I was
                    living in. But those are sort of accidents of living in a war zone, much more
                    than somebody deciding, “We're going to go out and get the American Charg�.” As
                    I have often said, if the PLO had wanted to blow me away, they could have done
                    it anytime they wanted to because they had all kinds of assets in West
                    Beirut—far more than anybody else. They knew where I was going, I'm sure, even
                    though we tried to keep that relatively quiet. But if I was making a call on the
                    leader of the Druze, it wouldn't be very hard for the Palestinians to find out
                    very quickly where I was, and follow me back. While I had this protection—the
                    lead car, and me in the middle car, and a follow car, and armored plate and
                    guns, and all that—still the Palestinians with the assets that they had, the PLO
                    could have blown me away anytime they wanted to.</p>

                    pleasant during this period when everybody had to live, work and eat in the
                    chancellery building. When you really couldn't go out unless you had a very
                    official appointment, and unless you had a body guard with you. One of the
                    things that Ray Hunt did, was to organize a mess so that we were all eating
                    together, and he hired a cook to set that up. Otherwise you'd find people eating
                    peanut butter and jelly sandwiches in their rooms whenever they could, or trying
                    to cook over a hot plate, and that's terrible. But before Ray left he had gotten
                    this organized, so we basically met three times a day for meals.</p>

                        problems? Did you have your own form of entertainment?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LANE: Not serious. We had a lot of movies that came in the pouch bag. That was
                    the activity every night, everyone would watch movies and, of course, we were
                    pretty busy, we were all working which was the best thing to have happen. If you
                    weren't working 12-14 hour days, you'd go crazy in a situation like that. But
                    there was a lot to do, and we were never quite sure if and when a new battle
                    would break out between the Christians and the Muslims, and the U.S. Embassy was
                    located pretty close to no-man's land. So we could have very easily been in a
                    war zone.</p>

                        Were you able to have any sort of social contact outside the Embassy at that

                </p>
                <p>LANE: Very little. There weren't very many Embassies left at that point. The
                    British were just down the road, and we saw a fair amount of the British both
                    personally and professionally. As happens so often in the Foreign Service, but
                    really has only happened to me once, the man who was my counterpart in Benghazi
                    during Qadhafi's revolution, who had headed a much larger British Embassy office
                    in Benghazi, was the British Ambassador in Beirut when I was there as Charg�. He
                    is now Sir Peter Wakefield. So we obviously had some things in common, and
                    talked to each other frequently. But during those three or four months, before
                    things opened up, it was fairly tight.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then how did things change with the arrival of Ambassador

                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>LANE: Yes. By the time Ambassador Parker arrived, dependents were returning, and
                    the situation had gotten better. You could move back and forth across the green
                    line on a fairly regular basis. There were always incidents, but people moved
                    around in West Beirut at night, social life resumed, people gave dinner parties,
                    people went to and fro. Things were almost back to “normal” for almost a year
                    there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So that when you left things were fairly normal, were

                </p>
                <p>LANE: Yes, I guess it's fair to say that. It's hard to think back. Of course,
                    there was the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in March of '78—Operation Litani—the
                    first time the Israelis went in to try to wipe out the Palestinian PLO
                    encampments in Southern Lebanon, which led to the creation of UNIFIL, and that
                    sort of thing. That was in '78.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you explain what UNIFIL is?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LANE: That was the United Nations force in Lebanon which was created by the
                    United Nations as an attempt to put a buffer zone between the Israelis and the
                    rest of Lebanon, so to speak. The Israelis always complained that there were
                    occasional attacks across the border by Palestinian units who would sneak into
                    south Lebanon and fire rockets into northern Israeli, and then retreat. They'd
                    disappear. Very frustrating for the Israelis, very frustrating for the
                    inhabitants of the area because what the Israelis would do in return, was to
                    pound them. Of course, the people who did the dirty work were no longer there.
                    The Palestinians would run in with a mortar or rocket launcher, fire off some
                    rounds, disappear, and Israeli retaliation would come on the heads of the poor
                    Shia farmers who lived there. But this caused a very nasty situation, more
                    dangerous politically for the Israelis than militarily, and particularly with
                    the arrival of the Begin government in '77 in Israel. For the first time the
                    Labor party and its allies were no longer in power in Israel and the more
                    hardline, right wing government came into power, started meddling, if you will,
                    dealing much more effectively with the Christian Lebanese against the
                    Palestinians and the Muslims in Lebanon. So frankly, I think, things started to
                    get worse at that point.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then with this increased Israeli activity concerning
                        Southern Lebanon in early '78, how did that effect the Embassy's relations
                        with the Lebanese authorities? Did that mean that a good deal of your
                        attention and time was spent countering Lebanese concerns?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>LANE: Our relationship with the Lebanese authorities was really very close
                    beginning with the time when the security situation got better. We could move
                    back and forth, and Ambassador Parker arrived, who was a brilliant Ambassador,
                    and who had long experience in Lebanon and was able to take advantage of that.
                    Basically the Lebanese were upset that obviously the Israelis were coming into
                    their country, and they were counting on us, as their number one supporter, to
                    get the Israelis out, and to do everything we could to really support the
                    territorial integrity of Lebanon which we always said we supported. And they
                    were disappointed, I think, that we weren't able to do more.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Following your assignment in Beirut, you were posted as
                        Ambassador to Yemen, and I suppose that was something of a consequence of
                        your service in Lebanon. How did that take place?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LANE: Yes, I think you're probably right. People felt that since I'd gone in to
                    replace Ambassador Frank Meloy, and held the fort until Dick Parker got there,
                    that I should be rewarded. I think that's one reason I did get the job as
                    Ambassador to Yemen. I understand later, too, that there was one fellow who
                    turned it down, who was better qualified, frankly, so I've got no kick coming
                    there. This was another example actually where things were such in Lebanon in
                    March, April of '78 that we were sort of looking forward to a third year there.
                    Lebanon, and Beirut, had been important in our lives. We were married in Beirut,
                    my wife's parents were missionaries in Lebanon; we knew a lot of people there,
                    and it's a fascinating place; and it was a fascinating professional problem.
                    But, nevertheless, it was a great honor for me to be appointed Ambassador, and I
                    was very honored to be able to go off to Sanaa as Ambassador.</p>
                <p>As it turned out I was the first Ambassador to present credentials to the new
                    president of the Yemen Arab Republic since his predecessor had been blown up by
                    a suitcase bomb in June, and I got there in September. So the situation in Yemen
                    was not exactly calm either.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you were appointed Ambassador to Yemen, this entails
                        getting confirmation by the Senate, and often meeting with the President
                        beforehand. What sort of charge were you given in that process.”</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>LANE: Well, in theory all that may be true. But in fact I never met President
                    Jimmy Carter. To this day I have never shaken hands with Jimmy Carter whose
                    personal representative, theoretically, I was, so that is more “honored in the
                    breach than in the observance,” I think, in these days. I don't recall being
                    given any particular charge in Yemen. I think the idea was basically, hold the
                    fort, and see what's happening. “Let us know what's happening, and what you
                    think after you get there.” I don't recall any particular charge in connection
                    with the assignment. The confirmation process was pretty routine in my case. I
                    was very fortunate, more colorless in the sense that I had not attracted any
                    negative attention from anybody important on the Hill. At that stage, in 1978,
                    there were no political appointees who were interested in being Ambassador to
                    the Yemen Arab Republic. So there wasn't any problem there. At the confirmation
                    hearings, I think, the only person who was in the room was Senator McGovern who
                    asked me a couple of rather simple-minded questions that his staff had obviously
                    given him. And that was it.</p>
                <p>So I had a very uneventful confirmation process, and arrived in Yemen in
                    September. And then while we were there, we had all the usual things one has in
                    a Arab post. In October, about a month after we got there, there was an
                    attempted coup against the new president—according to some stories, financed and
                    inspired by Libya—which he was very lucky to be able to turn aside, to
                    overcome.</p>
                <p>And then early in the next year there was the Yemen mini-war in February and
                    March of 1979, between the two Yemens, which turned out to be quite an important
                    affair because the Saudis were concerned. There is a certain parallel between
                    what recently happened in the Gulf and what happened in '79. Because South Yemen
                    at this point was run by a very militant Marxist regime. One of the great
                    ironies is how South Yemen of all places, became the most Marxist of the Arab
                    governments. But it certainly did. It was run by a dedicated Marxist by the name
                    of Abd al Fattah Ismail. And after a series of border skirmishes between North
                    and South Yemen, the South Yemenis launched what looked like a fairly serious
                    attack into North Yemen, probably designed to so embarrass the president of
                    North Yemen that he would be forced out and someone sympathetic to South Yemen
                    would take over. The Saudis were worried about this because obviously they don't
                    want a Marxist Government on their border, and there happen to be more Yemenis
                    who live in the Arabian peninsula, than there are Saudis. So the Yemenis are a
                    potential threat to the Saudis.</p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>So apparently what happened—of course, I'm not sure because I was in Sanaa and
                    not in Washington, nor in Jeddah—was that the Saudis came to us and said, “Look,
                    you've been saying for years that you'll take care of our security, you'll do
                    what's necessary if there's a threat to our security. Well, we think there's a
                    threat to our security down there, so we want you to waive the time frame in the
                    Foreign Assistance Act, and we want you to send immediately 12 F-5 airplanes and
                    60 M-60 tanks, and 100 APCs”—all of which were part of a long run aid program
                    which we'd all worked out, and had just notified Congress of but it's supposed
                    to run 60 days before you do it. It gives Congress a chance to say “no.” And the
                    President at this time, Jimmy Carter—March of '79—remember what happened in
                    March of '79? Anyway, it was a last ditch attempt to put together the
                    Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty. It looked like it was falling apart. Jimmy Carter
                    is in the Middle East—or about to take off to the Middle East to try to pull
                    together something so that Camp David won't be a total disaster. And as he's
                    getting on the airplane at Andrews, somebody rushes up to him, and said, “Mr.
                    President, you've got to sign this waiver. It's in the vital interest of the
                    United States to send this stuff to Yemen or the Saudis are going to be mad at
                    us, and if the Saudis get mad at us it could be serious.” So Carter signs it and
                    this huge airlift started into Yemen, and of course the Yemenis didn't know how
                    to drive the tanks, the F-5s didn't arrive in time. But it was a psychological
                    statement. It may have had some effect on the overall situation.</p>

                <p>LANE: At that time there were two Yemens. There was the Peoples Democratic
                    Republic of Yemen, which was the former Aden Colony, which the British had
                    controlled since the 1840s, and which they had given its independence in 1967.
                    And then there was North Yemen which was the traditional Yemeni highlands, a
                    country which had been independent ever since the collapse of the Ottoman
                    Empire. And we had never had relations with South Yemen because from the moment
                    the South Yemenis acquired their own independence, we had a Consul General in
                    Aden, but it was with the British. After the South Yemen, or the PDRY, became
                    independent, it was a Marxist state and we never...</p>

                    the possibility of opening diplomatic relations with the PDRY in 1978 when the
                    president of North Yemen was blown up with a suitcase bomb, as I mentioned. So
                    there were these two Yemens which were constantly, during my time there, either
                    fighting each other, or talking about unity. Sometimes doing both at the same
                    time. So this was the battle that occurred then in 1979, which did have an
                    effect because the President and the Secretary of State, and Dr. Brzezinski all
                    got involved. The Saudis were concerned and somebody in Washington said, “If the
                    Yemen crisis hadn't existed, we would have had to invent it in order to show the
                    Soviets that we hadn't been completely demoralized by Vietnam, and that we're
                    still prepared to protect our interest by sending military forces if we had
                    to.”</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So that suggests that during your time as Ambassador
                        there, there were some rather extensive American political-military
                        interests in the region if only in relation to Saudi Arabia.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LANE: Very definitely in the region, there was no question. Saudi Arabia...it's
                    hard to—well, it's not so hard to remember anymore now—it was a year ago. But in
                    1979 and '80, Saudi Arabia was producing 10 million barrels of oil a day—365
                    days a year—and they were selling it for about $30.00 a barrel, that's what the
                    price was in 1980. I think that's 100 billion dollars, and that's an awful lot
                    of money. And, of course, because of the disruption caused by the fall of the
                    Shah of Iran, that's the second oil crisis since 1973 that oil production has
                    dropped precipitously. We had a real crisis in oil supply, and if the Saudis
                    hadn't produced as much as we wanted, we would have had a real disaster in this
                    country. Saudi Arabia was very important because of its swing position in the
                    oil supply business, and because of what it did with all its oil money. If the
                    Saudis don't put that money into U.S. GOVERNMENT bonds, we're in trouble. One of
                    the reasons I suspect that we went into the Gulf earlier this month was because
                    if somebody controls all those billions that the Kuwaitis had invested in U.S.
                    Government bonds, and doesn't roll them over (as per their famous movie), the
                    U.S. financial system, which is already in fragile state could suffer a very
                    nasty blow. I'm no economist, but that's my guess.</p>

                <p>LANE: We had a sort of a typical U.S. presence, I think, of a medium sized
                    nature. We had the Embassy, we had a USIS office, we had a Peace Corps, we had
                    an Attach�...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Attach� meaning military?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LANE: A military Attach�, and a small Office of Defense Cooperation, a small
                    military assistance group. We had an A.I.D. mission. So we had basically the
                    full package. Not nearly as big as in some countries, but a lot bigger than some
                    others. And as you say, the Ambassador's job was to serve as the head of the
                    Country Team, and we had Country Team meetings at least once a week. I did it
                    once a week partly because the A.I.D. mission was here, and the Peace Corps was
                    over there— if we'd all been in the same building, I might have tried to have a
                    short meeting every morning, but basically once a week was enough. And I tried
                    to keep those meetings reasonably short because the purpose of that meeting was
                    for each person in the meeting to tell everybody else in the meeting what they
                    needed to know about what he had been doing the past week, and was planning to
                    do in the next week. If one of those people had a major problem, they probably
                    needed to come and see me separately, and not bring it up in this big meeting.
                    So I used to tell people at the Country Team meeting, “I expect everyone of you
                    to speak for at least three minutes, and none of you speak for more than ten.” I
                    always felt there must be something that went on in their activities that they
                    could talk about for three minutes, the Military Attach� could say something for
                    that long anyway; that the Peace Corps Director would be interested in, and visa
                    versa, but I didn't want them to get into a long harangue about some particular
                    problem that they had and bore everybody else when it was basically something
                    that probably that person and I could handle.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LANE: Yes, it was somewhat personalized, partly because of the nature of the
                    situation. But mainly, I think, because of the Yemen mini-war, and the fact that
                    the President of Yemen wanted a lot of things from the United States. So what he
                    wanted to do—he wasn't used to working through the bureaucracy, and I'm not sure
                    he really trusted very many of his Ministers. He was very new, they weren't his
                    people, so when he wanted something, he would call up and have me come and see
                    him. I saw an awful lot of the president of the Republic, and we spent an awful
                    lot of time talking one-on-one in Arabic, which was a little dangerous— not
                    something that I would recommend. But if there were more than just the two of us
                    in the room, he started to act, to posture, for whoever else was in the room,
                    whether it was his interpreter, or one of his people, or my DCM—who was a super
                    guy, he has just been named as Ambassador to Kuwait. So I tended to do it
                    one-on-one, even though I would not recommend it to anybody else. Its not a good

                        there were the two Yemens. Now in the Security Council deliberations of the
                        Mid-East crisis I notice that there is one Yemen, and it has taken the
                        position at some variance with that of some other Arab countries, and of our
                        own country. Could you elaborate on that please?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LANE: Sure. As I guess I mentioned, there were two Yemens for a long time in
                    history, because of the British imperialism; the British went into Aden and then
                    took as much of the hinterland as they thought they needed. Since the British
                    gave it up in 1967, the two Yemens have been, as I guess I said, talking about
                    unity, and/or fighting each other and sometimes doing both at once. They realize
                    that they're basically the same people, that they're the same nation, but they
                    have had very different political systems and its been difficult therefore for
                    them to get together. Also, of course, Saudi Arabia has not been anxious to have
                    a united Yemen. There are more Yemenis in the Arabian Peninsula than there are
                    Saudis, and if the two Yemens unite that makes the demographic imbalance even
                    more dangerous from the Saudi point of view, particularly since there is a
                    little bit of the southwest corner of Saudi Arabia that used to be part of Yemen
                    and the Yemenis feel it should be part of Yemen again. So the Saudis have always
                    worked in various ways to try to prevent the unification of the two Yemens.</p>
                <p>But within the last year, as a result of a series of political moves on both
                    sides of the border, the two Yemens have come closer, and closer together, and
                    although I haven't been able to follow this very closely in the American press,
                    it's obvious that within the last six months, the two Yemens have formally
                    unified. Sanaa is now the capital of the united Yemen. The name is still Yemen,
                    of course, and therefore they are switched to one country in the United
                    Nations.</p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>Now the reason that I think the Yemen has taken a very cautious position on this
                    recent crisis in the Gulf—I hesitate to call it pro- Iraqi because I think
                    that's too strong—but at the same time they clearly have abstained on two
                    crucial Security Council votes. In fact, as an aside, I'll bet that Yemen wishes
                    fervently it was not a member of the Security Council at this particular time.
                    This is very awkward for them because on the one hand they don't want to
                    antagonize Saddam Hussein and Iraq. The Iraqis played an important role back in
                    1979 in helping to solve the Yemen mini-war in a way that maintained the present
                    president of Yemen, Ali Abdallah Salah, in his office as president. And I
                    suspect he remembers that, so he doesn't want to be too negative on the
                    Iraqis.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could I just interject—so that the present president of
                        the unified Yemen is the former president of North Yemen; whereas the
                        capitol is in the former capital of South Yemen. Is that correct?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LANE: No. The first half is correct. The president of North Yemen is now the
                    president of all of Yemen. And the capital of North Yemen is now the capital of
                    all Yemen. You hear a lot about Aden, and Aden is certainly the famous port, but
                    Sanaa is the capital. And the man who became the president of North Yemen, with
                    Saudi support incidentally in 1978, is Ali Abdallah Salah, and in spite of many
                    predictions that he would be overthrown, or removed, or something, and that he'd
                    never last, here he is twelve years later still very much in office, and not
                    only that, but apparently the man who has succeeded in unifying the two Yemens.
                    Now, it could still come apart, but every day that goes by, I think, makes unity
                    more likely.</p>

                        with him gives you a good chance to comment on how he might relate to the
                        United States, or the style in which he might rule his country.</hi>

                <p>LANE: He's an interesting man. He's a simple soldier in the sense that he comes
                    from a tribe in Yemen; he does not have a lot of foreign experience; he does not
                    have very much of an education; he is a forceful, dynamic man; he impressed some
                    people obviously early on or he would not have become president when he did.
                    Interestingly enough, Vice President Bush paid a visit to the Yemen, and met
                    President Salah, and President Salah liked him very much, and I guess President
                    Bush liked Salah well enough to invite him back for a State visit earlier this
                    year, although it was practically not reported in the American press. President
                    Salah did come to Washington, and there was a White House dinner for him. Then
                    he went down to Texas and had quite a time with Ray Hunt, I understand. And I
                    would guess that President Bush is very unhappy at this moment with his friend,
                    President Salah, who is not standing up to be counted and voting the way we'd
                    like to have him vote in the UN. I suspect relations have cooled considerably
                    between the United States and the Yemen as a result of this crisis. And, as I
                    said, I think the Yemen is doing this because they need Iraq as a counterweight
                    against Saudi Arabia. There may be more Yemenis than Saudis but if you talk
                    military or economic power, there's no question that the Saudis are much
                    stronger, and the Yemenis know that. And the Yemenis are fearful that the Saudis
                    may try to do something, political-military, to break up the unity of the two
                    Yemens, and therefore its very helpful, I guess, from their point of view, to
                    have a nice counterweight like Iraq on the other side which they can count on to
                    be friendly.</p>

                        now is perhaps moderate in its politics. In terms of its economy has it been
                        a sort of poor neighbor to Saudi Arabia, and to Kuwait, supplying workers
                        for the oil fields? And does that play into the political mix?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LANE: Exactly. The major foreign exchange earner of Yemen for years has been
                    remittances from Yemenis working in Saudi Arabia, primarily in construction. But
                    there are just hundreds of thousands literally of Yemenis who work in Saudi
                    Arabia in all aspects doing all the dirty work—an awful lot of the dirty work.
                    And it's traditional almost for the Yemeni male to go to Saudi Arabia to work
                    for a year, to live four or five in a room, to save all their money, and then to
                    buy a Land Rover just before they are about to come home, drive it across the
                    desert, and around the border post to evade the custom duties, and then set up
                    as taxi drivers in the Yemen. They're very enterprising people. They work very
                    hard when they go abroad, they don't work so hard at home because they spend too
                    much time chewing this mildly narcotic leaf called ghat.</p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>I should mention too that one of the strong factors for Yemenis is that they have
                    two or three very bright, well educated people now at the top of their
                    government. The Foreign Minister is Abd Al Karim Iryani has a Ph.D. from Yale in
                    agricultural economics, I think. But, nevertheless, as you can see from that a
                    very well educated man who spent some time working at the Kuwait Development
                    Bank, and various such organizations. One of the Vice Presidents is Abd Al Aziz
                    Abd Al Ghani, who went to Colorado College, and then the University of Colorado,
                    and was the head of their central bank for a while, and has been sort of a
                    stabilizing force at the top of their government bureaucracy for years. So they
                    have this dynamic man of the people soldier who is the president, but they also
                    have some other men who come from very distinguished Yemenis families, and who
                    are very well educated. I mentioned just two, but there are others who can run
                    various parts of their government.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LANE: That's hard for me to say. Saddam Hussein, as an individual, was not a
                    factor in Yemen when I was there. I mean, from '78 to '81 one talked about Iraq,
                    one didn't talk about Saddam Hussein. I don't know whether as an individual—I
                    would guess that he doesn't have much impact. The Yemenis are a proud and
                    ancient people. They had a great civilization in Yemen, not as soon as the
                    Sumerians did, but they've had one there for a long time going back to the age
                    of David and Solomon and the Queen of Sheba. So they don't get overly impressed

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Returning to your time as Ambassador to Yemen, to the time
                        in 1979, it was a difficult time for an American envoy to be in an Islamic
                        country because there had been riots after the attempted takeover of the
                        mosque in Mecca against the U.S. for supposedly involvement, and our Embassy
                        in Islamabad, Pakistan was burned. Dependents in some posts were ordered
                        evacuated. How was the situation for you at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>LANE: This was a very difficult moment, both personally and professionally in the
                    Yemen because what happened was, that the Department sent out a telegram saying,
                    “You should organize a voluntary evacuation. And anybody who wants to leave,
                    should be able to leave and we want to be able to cut down the number of
                    Americans we have in Muslim countries, and particularly in Shia Muslim
                    countries.” This was again because of the problems in...not only those two that
                    you mentioned, but, of course, the problems in Iran. And many of us sent back
                    telegrams saying, “There really doesn't look like there's going to be any
                    problem in this country, and we have polled all the people in the Embassy and
                    none of the people, and none of the dependents, want to leave.” And then the
                    Department sent out a telegram saying, in effect, “You misunderstood. What we
                    were telling you was, you will reduce the numbers 'voluntarily'. We're not
                    telling you everybody has to leave, but we are telling you some people have to
                    leave.” So basically every Ambassador was faced with having to try to figure out
                    how to reduce the number of dependents, and how do you do that if nobody wants
                    to go? Well, it was a very awkward and tough situation, and particularly, of
                    course, the host countries were absolutely insulted in all cases. This
                    originally, it is my understanding—I may be getting into classified stuff
                    here—but this went to all countries, including Saudi Arabia. The Embassy in
                    Saudi Arabia basically went back and said, “If you apply this to Saudi Arabia,
                    you are going to destroy a relationship which we have worked years to build.
                    You're telling the Saudis that they're the same as the Iranians. You're telling
                    the Saudis you don't trust them. Maybe we can get away with this, or maybe it
                    doesn't matter if you do it in the Yemen, but it sure as hell matters if you do
                    it in Saudi Arabia in 1979.”</p>
                <p>So the order was modified and changed, and limited, but some Ambassadors went in
                    and said, “None of my people want to go.” And the Department came out and said,
                    as I just mentioned, “They will go.” This caused a lot of bitterness.</p>

                <p>LANE: The Military Attach� wanted to send his wife out, and the Assistant
                    Military Attach� was basically ordered by the Military Attach�s to send his wife
                    out—his wife and children. Some of the AID people left. My wife did not leave.
                    We didn't have any dependent children there; it obviously made a difference if
                    you had small children. So some people went, some people didn't. Basically I
                    didn't have a dramatic problem because I didn't have to order anybody out while
                    letting my wife stay, which would have been a very awkward position because
                    there were some who wanted to leave anyway. But, I can still remember the Under
                    Secretary in the Foreign Ministry saying, “Ambassador Lane, you understand this
                    country. You've been here long enough to know we're not like the Iranians, or
                    the Pakistanis. We're not going to burn your schools down, or burn your Embassy
                    down. You'll get protests from us if you do things we don't like but, for
                    heaven's sake...” and I didn't think they were either. Half the Yemenis are
                    Shiites, but they don't belong to the same Shia sect as the Iranians, they all
                    thought Khomeini was crazy. They have no religious bond there at all, which many
                    people in Washington seemed to think there was. It was a very tough situation. I
                    understand that Jimmy Carter, and Cyrus Vance sitting in Washington looking out
                    at the world...it's their responsibility, all those people out there, “Are you
                    just going to do nothing, and watch Embassies get burned down?” You feel like
                    you've got to do something. Yet, you do something like this, and of course, it's
                    terrible for morale in the Embassy, and it terrible for relationships between
                    the United States and the host country. So it was a very tough thing.</p>
                <p>The other really tough thing that I had in Yemen which people might be interested
                    in, was during the Yemen mini-war. We had an initial report, this is March of
                    '79, that the South Yemenis had made a breakthrough, and were about to occupy
                    the city of Taiz in southern Yemen, and that the Yemenis troops were falling
                    back—the North Yemen troops. At this same time the North Yemen government was
                    telling us that the situation was terrible, “You've got to send us all sorts of
                    military help because if you don't, we're going to collapse.” As a result of
                    that I ordered all the Peace Corps volunteers who were in the Taiz area, to move
                    to Sanaa and this caused a real panic in that area because, of course, all the
                    Yemenis said, “Oh, my God, the Americans are leaving, so things must be
                    terrible.” The Prime Minister called me in, and said, “Do you realize you may
                    have brought down the Yemeni government?” And I said, “I'm sorry if that
                    happens. I hope it doesn't happen, but my primary responsibility has got to be
                    for the American citizens in this country, not for the Yemeni government, and I
                    hear these reports that the South Yemenis are coming in, and I hear from every
                    source in your government that you desperately need help, that you're not sure
                    you can hold the line. I've got to do that.” Well, as it turned out it wasn't
                    necessary, because they (the South Yemeni) didn't break through. It turned out
                    that the North Yemenis were exaggerating their difficulties in order to get
                    military help from us. So, in one sense, it turned out that I made the wrong
                    decision; but I'm not sure it was the wrong decision. I'm not sure that I
                    wouldn't do the same thing again if faced with the same situation. But, you
                    know, in miniature, this is the sort of thing that happened in Saigon. You know,
                    what was his name—it's just slipped my mind.</p>

                    South Vietnam, and I'm not trying to equate the two situations but it is a

                        in which this would factor into the whole political-military dilemma.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LANE: Yes, it's a little different there because the tough situation that the
                    Department, and maybe Nat Howell who is an old friend, have been facing in
                    Kuwait was, “Okay, who's essential?” You have to tell somebody, “You're not an
                    essential person now, so you leave.” This business of who is the essential is

                        the degree of Congressional interest in the post. Did you have
                        visitors?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LANE: That's a good question. In two and a half, almost three years in Yemen, we
                    had two Congressional visitors that I can remember. One was Senator Percy who
                    came early on, primarily I think, because his brother-in-law was head of the
                    Save The Children Fund—the American Save The Children Fund headquartered in
                    Connecticut, and Save The Children was doing some things in Yemen. So he heard
                    about the Yemen that way, and he and his wife came out to visit on Thanksgiving
                    with us, as I recall, the first year we were there. Very pleasant people, very
                    nice.</p>
                <p>The other Congressional visitor was Congressman Solarz from Brooklyn who came
                    with a staff of several people who were interested in the Jews in Yemen—how many
                    Jews were there left, where were they, how did they live, were they being
                    persecuted, could he and his staff go visit them? That was less pleasant because
                    the Yemenis were not about to roll out the red carpet for the Solarz group to go
                    visit the Jews of Yemen. There weren't very many left. Almost all of the Yemenis
                    Jews went to Israel in 1948 as the result of the famous Operation Flying Carpet
                    which was mounted at that time. There may be three or four hundred living in
                    certain isolated villages, and I really do believe that they're no more
                    maltreated than anybody else. Their life is no different. There is sort of a
                    tradition in some Yemeni villages that the Jews are the peace-makers because the
                    Muslim tribes won't trust each other but they trust a Jew to be fair between the
                    two Muslim tribes. But those were the only two Congressional visitors really in
                    two and a half years, and this was the period when they were just flooding into
                    Saudi Arabia. In '78 to '81 Saudi Arabia was the place to go.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LANE: Yes. We had a Military Assistance Advisory Group, which was called the ODC,
                    the Office of Defense Cooperation; a couple of people, and then there were some
                    more people who came on TDY. For a while there in 1979, we had two Air Force
                    pilots teaching the Yemenis how to fly the F-5 at Sanaa airport in the morning,
                    and the Soviets were teaching them how to fly the Sukoy in the afternoon—at same
                    airport, different pilots. That program, I think, still goes on. I think the F-5
                    program...the F-5 was a good airplane, a good plane for the Yemenis to have. And
                    we had some people also working with their ground forces; not much in the way of
                    Naval visits. We had a couple but not a lot.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LANE: Yes, yes, very much so really. The first Soviet Ambassador, when I first
                    arrived, was a wonderful old Bolshevik, who looked like a combination of
                    Khrushchev, and a dissipated W.C. Fields—a short stocky guy who drank too much,
                    and was a real aggressive fellow. The Soviets had had a long relationship with
                    the Yemen, supplying weapons, and helping the Egyptians who helped the Yemenis
                    in the Yemeni civil war. So they had 200 military advisers or so in the
                    Yemen.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This would be in North Yemen?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LANE: In North Yemen, not to mention what they had in South Yemen which was even
                    bigger. The U.S. military relationship with North Yemen was almost entirely
                    through the Saudis, which made the Yemenis furious because they wanted direct
                    relationship with the United States and not one dependent on the Saudis. But the
                    Yemenis didn't have any money. The Saudis were paying for everything, and he who
                    pays the piper, calls the tune. So we basically worked fairly closely with the
                    Saudis, as well as with the Yemenis and the Yemenis didn't like it a bit. But we
                    did have these U.S. F-5 pilots training the Yemenis...one of them just sent me a
                    card. He's just been made a Squadron Commander of a fighter wing in Germany,
                    he's now a Lieutenant Colonel—he was a Captain then.</p>

                <p>LANE: Not really, I mean he spoke nothing but Russian. The second Soviet
                    Ambassador was about 30 years younger, and definitely the second generation of
                    Soviet diplomats. I don't know whether you've read Charles Thayer's book,
                    Diplomat? But the first generation of Soviet diplomats were guys who came right
                    out of the revolution, really tough old Bolsheviks. The second generation
                    hardly...well, the Gorbachevs, well, not Gorbachev, of course, but Dobrynin
                    maybe. But well educated, speak three or four languages. This fellow had written
                    a Ph.D. thesis on the Yemen. He spoke Arabic and English as well as Russian. He
                    was still pretty arrogant, but a much smoother character, a much different type.
                    The first Soviet Ambassador used to go to these formal diplomatic things we have
                    to go to—he always carried a hip flask and nipped at it in the course of the

                        the Headquarters in Stuttgart, Germany, of the U.S. European Command which
                        ostensibly would seem to be out of area from your Mid-East expertise and
                        assignments, but in fact had some bearing on that. Could you elaborate,

                </p>
                <p>LANE: Yes. Despite the name of the U.S. European Command, in fact that command is
                    responsible for all U.S. military activities, not only in Europe, but in most of
                    Africa, and also in Lebanon, Syria and Israel, interestingly enough. The command
                    structure was changed a few years ago when they created CENTCOM. They wanted to
                    focus it (CENTCOM) on the Persian Gulf, and not on the Arab-Israeli problem. So
                    they took Syria, Lebanon and Israel, and left them with the old European
                    command. So as it turned out my experience in Lebanon and in Africa was very
                    useful, I think, to the command.</p>

                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>LANE: Yes. As you remember the big crisis in Lebanon was in 1982 with the Israeli
                    invasion, followed by the deployment of the multi- national force, the U.S.
                    troops, French troops, Italian troops, and eventually, I think, some British,
                    who first went to Beirut to oversee the evacuation of the PLO fighters from
                    Beirut in 1982 after the Israelis had invested the city. Then after the
                    assassination of the Lebanese President Bashir Gemayel there was the massacre at
                    the Sabra and Shatila refugee camps in Beirut, and a multi-national force was
                    sent back in to try to establish a presence which would assist, in some way, the
                    Lebanese government in gaining control of the situation, and facilitate the
                    Israeli evacuation of Lebanon. A long tangled tale which resulted in basically
                    disaster for U.S. foreign policy with the blowing up of the Marine barracks in
                    October of '83, and killing 243 Marines and sailors. So in my position...the
                    command was very much involved in all that because the chain of command ran from
                    the Marines on the beach, through the Sixth Fleet, through U.S. Navy Europe
                    headquarters, and then through U.S. military headquarters in Europe—that is,
                    Stuttgart—and then back to the Pentagon. So the ultimate responsibility in the
                    field for that operation was with General Rogers, who was both the NATO
                    commander and the U.S. only commander, and his deputy, General Lawson, who was
                    the de facto commander of the U.S. military operations in the command because
                    even though General Rogers officially wears two hats. (He's the NATO commander,
                    and he's the U.S. only commander.) In fact, he spent so much of his time being
                    NATO commander that he delegates almost all of his U.S. only responsibilities to
                    his deputy in Stuttgart, who in this case was General Lawson. And since the
                    Lebanese operation was clearly not a NATO operation, this was a very important
                    responsibility for the command to try to figure out how best to position, and
                    use the U.S. Marines who were sent in there.</p>
                <p>In some ways interesting, and some very frustrating because this was a job
                    (POLAD) where I was involved in everything, and responsible for nothing. Unlike
                    something like Yemen where you're involved in a very small part of the world,
                    but you have the ultimate responsibility for it in the field. And almost all the
                    policy in this case was being made in Washington. My role was basically writing
                    memos to my boss in the field, and working with the officers there in Stuttgart.
                    But we weren't making policy, and there weren't very many people in Washington
                    who were listening to anything we were saying about policy.</p>

                <p>LANE: I did. I visited Beirut a couple of times. The last time I visited Beirut,
                    I guess, was a week before the Embassy was blown up in April of '83. I was
                    sitting in Bob Dillon's office with General Smith, who was then the
                    commander...</p>

                <p>LANE: Was the Ambassador to Lebanon at that point. And a week after that they had
                    that horrendous explosion of the suicide bomb in front of the U.S. Embassy,
                    which killed something like 23 Americans and 50 Lebanese employees. The
                    Ambassador wasn't killed, but he was hurt—he was cut up a little bit. And that
                    was the explosion in which Bob Ames was killed. He was the CIA expert on Middle
                    East and Lebanon, and many other CIA people were meeting with him in the office
                    directly above where that explosion took place. It was a real disaster because
                    Bob Ames was a very bright, very smart, and very experienced guy, and he had the
                    confidence of the Secretary and some high ranking people in Washington. Who
                    knows, things might have been a little different if Bob had lived. It was a real
                    tragedy.</p>
                <p>I visited Egypt later on with the boss, but that was the last time in
                    Lebanon.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there another major activity that you were involved
                        with in EUCOM?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>LANE: The two major activities going on during the three years plus that I was in
                    EUCOM were, the question of INF deployment in Europe, and this problem in
                    Lebanon that I mentioned. The INF deployment in Europe grew out of the dual
                    track decision of 1979, that we were going to negotiate with the Soviets about
                    reducing nuclear weapons in Europe, but if that didn't succeed we were going to
                    begin to deploy a whole new generation of intermediate range nuclear weapons in
                    Europe to counter the Soviet's SS-20s. And this was a very controversial
                    political move. This was a period when...particularly when Reagan came into
                    office in early 1981, because this was the time when this decision was to be
                    implemented. And there was great opposition in Europe to the idea of any more
                    nuclear weapons going into Europe, particularly with U.S. finger on the trigger.
                    And particularly, as seen from Europe, with this cowboy who was talking about
                    the evil empire and that sort of thing, in charge of U.S. foreign policy. So for
                    three or four years it was a major political-military operation getting ready
                    the places where all these intermediate weapons were going to be deployed.
                    Getting the U.S. installations organized in Belgium, in Germany, in the UK,
                    Greenham Common, in Italy, Comiso. Coordinating all of this very closely between
                    the U.S. military and the U.S. Embassies, making sure that the people in
                    Washington didn't send us instructions that were impossible, or stupid, to
                    implement in the field. I've often said, I think it was the only foreign policy
                    success in the first Reagan administration, as far as I'm concerned, that we
                    succeeded in doing it. One of the great ironies, of course, is that it is now
                    all being undone. As part of the INF treaty, all that has been taken out. Which
                    is a good thing. I mean I think the INF treaty is a good thing to do. But the
                    contrast between that operation, and the Beirut operation, was really dramatic
                    because in the one we had very close political- military cooperation in the INF
                    deployment in Europe. Both the Embassies and my boss in Stuttgart, and in
                    Washington too, to some extent, went out of their way to try to coordinate and
                    be sure that everybody knew what the other fellow was doing, make sure that the
                    guys in the Embassies know what the military problems are so they can keep those
                    in mind when they negotiate with their counterparts, and make sure the military
                    guys understand the political sensitivities so they don't go charging around
                    like bulls in a China shop messing everything up and causing problems they don't
                    have to cause.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LANE: No, my Embassy—I didn't have an Embassy—I worked for the General. And the
                    Ambassador in Bonn at this time was Arthur Burns for most of this period. Arthur
                    Burns occasionally thought I worked for him, so it did require some diplomacy on
                    my part.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you talked about the Embassies being kept in very
                        close coordination with our military authorities, which Embassies were you
                        referring to?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>LANE: Basically the Embassies in the deployment countries: that is, London, Bonn,
                    Brussels, Rome. But also all of them, every NATO Embassy. It was important that
                    our Ambassador in Denmark know what was going on with this military deployment
                    so if the Foreign Minister called him, he could reassure the Foreign Minister
                    even though nothing was going on in Denmark. Again, it's a long story and I
                    would like sometime...it's one of those things I would like to write up some
                    day, is the story of that INF deployment, because I think it would make a
                    fascinating article on political-military cooperation, and how it can work. I
                    think the kind of cooperation that we developed, and one of the people who
                    started all this was Ed Streator who was the DCM in London in 1982, I guess,
                    because it was very shortly after I got there. He sent a telegram into
                    Washington saying, “Look, as I look at the schedule here we're supposed to be
                    deploying these things in Europe one year from now as part of what we've said
                    we're going to do, as part of our policy. We don't have plans to do this. We
                    haven't talked about it among ourselves, among the Embassies, or traded ideas
                    about where the problems are. We haven't talked to the military, we've got to
                    sit down and do this.” London organized a conference, and got all these people
                    together, and my boss...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This would be Americans, and there would be people from
                        the Embassies, and be the political advisers such as yourself?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LANE: This was Americans only, including the military. A lot of the key Generals
                    and Colonels who were doing this. Get everybody in the same room talking about
                    what their problems are.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you went with your General?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LANE: Not my General, but two or three of his people. But I went, the other
                    POLADS were there, the political advisers from the Embassies, the
                    political-military officers from the Embassies, Political Counselors, and they
                    did the same kind of a thing with Public Affairs people. How are we going to
                    sell this? There was a lot of opposition in Europe to having more American
                    nuclear weapons, with American fingers on the trigger. Not surprising if you
                    were a European.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. I was thinking you went from the green line in Beirut
                        to the Green Party in Germany.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>LANE: In a sense, that's true. The Greens were certainly symbolic at this point.
                    You know, Germans camped out in front of the compound in Stuttgart, and sort of
                    in effect saying, “Why do we need more nuclear weapons?” And trying to explain
                    to the American GIs, “These guys are not anti-American, they are anti-nukes. If
                    we were trying to do this outside your hometown, it might be your sister out
                    there.” Well try to get this point across. But, anyway, it worked well. We had
                    problems of course. They are, of course, strong minded people, and you've got a
                    military guy who comes in and says, “God damn it, my orders are to do this. Get
                    out of my way.” Sometimes you get the State Department, or political types who
                    say, “Oh, my, you mustn't do that. You might ruffle somebody's feathers.” You
                    have to try to balance these out. But anyway, it was a classic example of good
                    cooperation, whereas the Lebanon operation was just the opposite. We had five
                    different special Presidential envoys, I think, who were trying to manage that
                    Lebanese problem: Phil Habib, Morris Draper, Rumsfeld, McFarlane, and Fairbanks,
                    I think. Not one of them ever came to Stuttgart. Rumsfeld, I think, went through
                    Brussels to talk to Bernie Rogers, and my boss went up there to see him,
                    unfortunately I didn't get to go. But that's the sort of thing...I'm not saying
                    if they had come it would have solved all the problems, but it would have made
                    things easier.</p>
                <p>Another thing that was really important in all this, was during the INF
                    deployment my boss, a four-star General who was acting in charge in Stuttgart,
                    invited every single U.S. Ambassador in Western Europe to come visit him, spend
                    24-hours, sit in on a briefing, and have dinner with him at his residence. So
                    we'd give them a briefing with a dog and pony show that the military always puts
                    on, and then he would get to talk for as long as he wanted to about the problems
                    in his country, and some of us would ask him questions. And then the boss would
                    throw a big dinner party for him with some leading people from Stuttgart, and
                    some from elsewhere. And at the end of 24 hours if there was a problem in the
                    Embassy two months later, General Lawson could pick up the phone and he knew the
                    Ambassador, they'd had dinner together. It was a big help. It made a
                    difference.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your role in that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LANE: I basically don't claim much credit myself. I think this was General
                    Lawson's idea before he came. I did a lot of facilitating—my office did—of
                    setting up the Ambassadorial visits. I'd talk with the Ambassador's staff, when
                    is a good time for him to come, and explain to the Ambassador's people what we
                    did in EUCOM. They were talking with somebody who's from the Foreign Service, as
                    they were, so that made it easier. And a lot of these people I did know from
                    some post or other. The first visitor we had, I think, was Harry Bergold, who
                    was the Ambassador in Hungary. Harry and I came into the Foreign Service
                    together in the same class. I played a facilitating role but I don't claim to
                    have organized it.</p>

                        Service corps did not work well together. We're not comfortable with each
                        other. Do you have some general observations of your impressions of this
                        problem, and what can be done about it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LANE: I think you're right. I think there very much is a problem. They do tend
                    not to be comfortable with each other. I used to say once in a while, a little
                    facetiously, that every Foreign Service Officer seems to think that every U.S.
                    military officer is a dumb cluck who can't say anything except, “nuke them until
                    they glow.” And every military officer seems to think every Foreign Service
                    Officer is an effete slob, if not a homosexual, and will give away the whole
                    store if given half a chance. And the trouble is that about one out of a hundred
                    they're right in each case. But the other 99, of course, it's totally wrong, and
                    if you go to places like the War College you discover that sometimes the Foreign
                    Service people are much more hawkish than the military in terms of using force.
                    How do you get around it? Things like the War College are good, cross-cultural
                    assignments, getting Foreign Service Officers into the military academies,
                    getting military guys into the State Department. We need as much of that as we
                    can get because, of course, those cliches are way off. There are some very
                    bright Colonels that I met with EUCOM—I say Colonels, because they were mostly
                    Majors and Colonels by the time they reached that staff. And there are some dumb
                    Generals and we've got some dumb Ambassadors, and some bright people in our
                    Service too, and some dumb people. I don't know quite how you get around the
                    problem except as much cross fertilization as you can get.</p>

                <p>LANE: I think you're right. I think it is going to be more political. I think it
                    may also be that NATO will become de facto the place where the U.S. and the
                    major European countries coordinate their military policies worldwide. We've
                    never done that in NATO before because NATO was so concerned with the so-called
                    “out of area problems.” NATO has a specific area of responsibility, and if the
                    U.S. would say, “Well, let's talk about what our policies should be in the
                    Persian Gulf,” or something like that, the other NATO countries would say,
                    “That's not a NATO problem. We do not discuss that in this forum.” So we didn't
                    have any place where we could discuss that, really. And my boss was trying to
                    develop that a little bit through EUCOM because that was U.S. only. But the
                    natural place to do it is NATO.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It is, although in this present Gulf crisis Germany has
                        stated that it feels limited because of its NATO membership and constraints
                        to playing any role.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>LANE: Well, that's fine. I'm not saying everybody has to play exactly the same
                    role, or march in lockstep at all. But where do we consult about who can do
                    what? NATO, it seems to me, is the obvious place and I don't think we're ever
                    going to get to the point of changing the official area of responsibility of
                    NATO because that would make it much too complicated, and it might stir up some
                    opposition from various other people for various reasons. But as a matter of
                    practice, why can't the Germans say that? Everybody understands that. People
                    don't want the Germans to start throwing their weight around. So I think the
                    military won't disappear entirely, but if we get the military-political
                    coordination, why not?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: From your EUCOM position you then retired from the Foreign
                        Service, returned to Massachusetts where you had ties. Looking back over
                        your career, what would you consider the highlights personally in terms of
                        what you felt you accomplished, and secondly, maybe as being an eye witness
                        to something you considered to be of an historic moment?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LANE: Personally the high point has to be Yemen simply because I was the
                    Ambassador, and I was in charge, and it was an interesting time- -a lot of
                    things going on. Much to my surprise really, the Yemen did become sort of
                    headline activity when I was there. The top people in the U.S. Government were
                    interested in what was happening. I remember a long one hour trying to explain
                    Yemen to Bud McFarlane when he was Counselor in the Department.</p>
                <p>In terms of observing, I guess, it would clearly be the last assignment in EUCOM.
                    As I mentioned, those two activities that the headquarters was very much
                    involved in, and therefore that I was very much involved in. The deployment of
                    INF weapons in Europe, and the U.S. military involvement in Lebanon from 1982 to
                    '84 were things that we followed very closely, and were active in, in the
                    command. And I played a role on the edge of that, as I mentioned to you. I think
                    there are some lessons to be learned from what we did right on the INF
                    deployment, and what we did wrong in Lebanon, which could be expanded on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, now, taking Lebanon as one case and amplified by the
                        present Persian Gulf crisis, do you feel looking back on your career as an
                        Arab specialist, that the Foreign Service has less voice now in these
                        matters and within the State Department it is more difficult to be effective
                        as an Arab specialist?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>LANE: I have always felt that if you wanted to make foreign policy, you don't
                    join the Foreign Service. What we do in the Foreign Service is to study foreign
                    countries, to report about foreign countries, to make recommendations about
                    foreign policy, and to implement foreign policy. But the final decisions about
                    foreign policy, of course, are made by the President and the people he appoints,
                    and that's the way it ought to be. That's the way the system works. A wonderful
                    statement that Warren Rudman made to Ollie North during the hearings when
                    Colonel North was explaining the way things should have been done; and Senator
                    Rudman stood up and looked at him and said, “Colonel North, you've got to
                    understand that the American people have the right to be wrong.” I may disagree
                    with what the policy is, but you, you know, you were in the game, you know the
                    rules. You either carry out the policy or you quit. I always felt you get one
                    chance to say “no.” I mean this happened to me a couple of times where you get
                    instructions from Washington, “Go see the Foreign Minister and tell him this...”
                    And you go back and you say, “I think it would be a great mistake if I were to
                    do that. Here's why I think it's a mistake, here's what I think we ought to do.”
                    And then they come back and say, “Okay, we agree with you. Try it your way. When
                    they say 'no', you carry out your previous instructions.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You have the one chance to make an input.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LANE: You've had your shot, and then you go ahead and do it. If you can't do it,
                    you quit. I'm not sure it hasn't always been that way. I mean you begin to read
                    about Truman, and the decision to recognize Israel, and all of that. The Foreign
                    Service people were unanimously opposed to it at that point apparently, and the
                    decision was influenced by domestic politics, by Truman's personal feelings, and
                    by some non-Foreign Service type advisers. And I think that's been true all
                    along as long as I've been in the Foreign Service. There are, of course, a few
                    career people in the Foreign Service who have very special positions—Llewellyn
                    Thompson, or someone like that. But most of us, as I say, if you want to make
                    foreign policy, join a Congressman's staff or pick the right man that's going to
                    be president. It's very rare that a Foreign Service Officer really makes policy
                    on any important issues, I think.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I understand that one concern of potential applicants for
                        the Foreign Service nowadays, is with personal security, that this has
                        changed so dramatically over the space of 20 or 30 years. You certainly
                        experienced that yourself in your assignments in Lebanon, and elsewhere. And
                        I've also noticed myself with some concern the way in which we have hardened
                        Embassies in order to make them theoretically more secure, perhaps at the
                        cost of shutting out meaningful contacts with the countries to which we're
                        assigned. Do you have some observations on that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>LANE: Yes. I think you're absolutely right. The simple, the short way to say
                    this, is that in order to get perfect security, you have to have perfect
                    isolation. In which case, as a Foreign Service Officer, you're perfectly useless
                    and we've been moving in that direction. It's easy to understand why. There have
                    been far more Ambassadors killed in the last ten years than there have been
                    Generals. We've lost...you can probably name them as quickly as I could—Cleo
                    Noel and Curt Moore in Khartoum.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Adolph Dubs in Afghanistan.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LANE: ...Spike Dubs in Afghanistan, Frank Meloy, I've talked about. Rodger Davies
                    in Cyprus, I think it was. Its become a very dangerous profession. I would argue
                    it's more dangerous than being in the military these days. A friend of mine at
                    the local Rotary Club said the other day, “What is it with you guys? The
                    President is on vacation telling the Ambassador, as a career Foreign Service
                    Officer, 'Just hang in there in Kuwait.'” And I said, “That's what I've been
                    trying to tell you fellows for years. We are not a bunch of striped pants cookie
                    pushers. It's a tough job out there.” But I think you're right, it has clearly
                    affected the job, and it must be inhibiting for anyone coming in. Not only that
                    it's more dangerous, I suppose you wouldn't be normal if you weren't a little
                    worried about getting shot up or getting kidnapped, but it makes it so much less
                    fun, and so much less interesting if you can't move around on your own in a
                    country. It's bad enough, as you say, if we turn all of our Embassies into
                    fortresses. But then most of us, you know, we didn't see very many people in our
                    offices in the Embassy anyway, unless it was Americans. If you wanted to see the
                    host country people, you went out to call on them. But if you can't go out on
                    the street without a personal bodyguard, and if you can't go see somebody
                    without having your bodyguard stand by his front door, he's not very anxious to
                    have you come. It certainly is terribly inhibiting for the business as a whole.
                    I hope we can find some way to get away from it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I do think that this hardening of the Embassies does make
                        an impact on the overall impression foreigners have of the U.S., whether
                        they would be frequent visitors at the Embassy, for political or economic
                        reasons is this whole paradox that the U.S. claims it's the land of freedom
                        and second opportunity and democracy, and yet we button up and hunker down
                        at our installations overseas.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LANE: And yet what would you recommend? Given the number of people who have been
                    killed, or the number of hostages who have been taken, can we afford to have a
                    totally open Embassy anymore?</p>

                <p>LANE: It's a tough dilemma, a very tough dilemma.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let me ask you this. Were you to do it all over again
                        under the present circumstances, do you think you would opt for a career in
                        the Foreign Service?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LANE: That's a tough question. Without the security problem, yes, in the sense
                    that I don't feel frustrated because I didn't make foreign policy, or I don't
                    feel that I got a rotten deal from the Foreign Service. You must never, never
                    trust a bureaucracy, and I never did unless I had to, unless I really didn't
                    have any choice. I know some people I think did feel terribly let down by the
                    “Service.” They felt they had given up all sorts of things for the Service, and
                    that the Service didn't respond, didn't repay. I'm sure that's the case, but I
                    don't have any complaints on that score. But knowing how tough the security
                    situation is, and the regulations are now in many parts of the world, boy, I
                    don't know. I'm not sure.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One follow-on question about your life in retirement which
                        has certainly been a very active one. Do you feel that you are continuing to
                        serve U.S. interests, and maybe your own personal interests, by being a
                        former representative of the Foreign Service, and being one who has had
                        experience and some knowledge on areas of vital interest to the U.S.?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LANE: Yes, I do. I feel I'm very, very lucky in this regard. I am now, as you
                    know, teaching one course each semester at both Clark and Holy Cross in
                    Worcester. So that's about a half-time teaching load. I'm teaching a course on
                    the U.S. in Middle East, and a course on arms control. So those are both
                    subjects I think are important. They are both subjects on which I can bring to
                    the students a slightly different perspective than they get from their more
                    academic professors who know the literature much better than I do, but who
                    haven't had the practical experience. So I think, from the point of view of the
                    students, it's useful to get both perspectives. And I think it is helpful when I
                    give my course on the U.S. in the Middle East, I tell some stories about
                    Qadhafi, or things in the Yemen, and that does make it come alive for the
                    students, I think, and it does, I hope, get across the idea that the Foreign
                    Service is not all striped pants. I think I wore striped pants once in 30 years,
                    and that was at a National Day in Lebanon when President Sarkis wanted to make
                    an impression that everything was normal. So I think that is helpful. I hope it
                    serves the country a little bit, but I know I find great satisfaction in being
                    able to do it.</p>

                        know I was at an elder hostel recently and talked to a man in his eighties
                        who said I was the first Foreign Service Officer he had ever met, and it had
