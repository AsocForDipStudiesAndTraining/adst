                <p>[Note: Transcript was not edited by Mr. Stokes]</p>
                <p>STOKES: I came into the foreign service in a way that may have implications for
                    the reminder of my career because it was from a very improbable place. I was a
                    student of mathematics and physics during World War II. That was used through my
                    service as editor of a technical publication in meteorology for the all the
                    allied forces, not only the US Air Force but also the Commonwealth and even the
                    Soviet Air Force.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where was this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STOKES: The publication was in Asheville, North Carolina. I had been trained as a
                    dynamic meteorologist, that is the theoretical foundation for meteorology, by
                    the Air Force. They brought together learned professors from all over the
                    country to Grand Rapids Michigan and trained us in the course for a year, and
                    from there my colleagues were sent all over the world to combat assignments,
                    many of them behind Japanese lines. And in the course of the assignment I
                    received a phone call from the weather service headquarters selecting me to do
                    this work because of my experience in journalism as well as science. While I was
                    in North Carolina I took the foreign service written examination.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: '46?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STOKES: '45, because it just seemed like an interesting challenge in the
                    abstract. My motivation wasn't yet formed. As the war in Europe came to an end,
                    the Air Force offered a program for career service for people they wanted to
                    retain, that you could go anywhere in the world for any degree on any subject as
                    long as it could be related in some way to the future needs of the Air Force.
                    And I went to the University of Chicago, chose that for studies in physics,
                    mathematics and meteorology. That was the leading center of the world. The
                    atomic scientists of Chicago were there, the founder of dynamic meteorology, Dr.
                    Rosby, was there. It was at that moment under President Hutchins.</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>One day in my mailbox came a notification that I had passed the written
                    examination and was invited to appear at the oral exams and I wrote back saying,
                    “I'm sorry my career has taken this other turn, thank you anyway.” They said
                    there is going to be a traveling board in Chicago, why don't you tell them what
                    has happened and they will arrange it administratively. Well a few months went
                    by and at this time I was living in International House and my roommate had been
                    a Dutch physicist under the Nazi occupation. My neighbor across the hall had
                    been a judge in the Weimar republic, my girlfriend was a student of
                    international affairs. I'd been invited to join the atomic scientists of Chicago
                    that was concern that civilians would make a mess of the world and that
                    scientific discoveries would be turned to mass slaughter. So when the time came
                    to have this administrative conversation with the board, new horizons and the
                    importance of foreign affairs and our role abroad had come for the first time to
                    the forefront of my mind. But this certainly hadn't changed my thought of career
                    at this point. I remember going into the room to meet the board, and there's a
                    circle of people and they began asking me questions and it's my nature just to
                    rise to the bait instinctively. Those people want me to talk, I'm overjoyed.
                    Well, this went on for about an hour and finally a person who didn't speak at
                    all, didn't ask any questions, was in civilian clothes, leaned forward and said,
                    “I'm General Arthur Harris, United States Air Force, and Captain Stokes, I want
                    to know what you're doing in this room when you've signed a commitment to serve
                    five years to the United States Air Force.” Everything went silent. And
                    something within me lead me to reply, “General, I certainly am committed to the
                    US government to serve it in any role it considers most useful to it. Another
                    silence and then I was excused and the next thing I know there was a letter in
                    my mailbox a week later from the Director General to the Adjutant General of the
                    Air Force asking for my release. And then for the first time I had sole
                    searching to do because up to that point there had not been a decision of any
                    kind. But the idea that the atomic scientists had raised in my mind was
                    something I couldn't put away. How do you want to spend your life, developing
                    more scientific insight, or dealing in some way with how it's applied to the
                    affairs of the world. And that lead me then to commit in my heart. But I was
                    totally unprepared in the conventional way. I had never studied international
                    law or economics or political science. All these questions on the examination on
                    these subjects I just went at doggedly without preparation and had the minimum
                    passing grade on the written. In fact to this day I don't know how I did but
                    apparently the oral balanced it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The word was in those days, as I recall, that if they
                        liked you in the oral they gave you enough of a grade to give you the
                        average which was required which was 80. 70 was passing in the written, but
                        then if they liked you I think they'd give you enough to average the 80.
                        That happened with me I got a 74 and they gave me an 86, which gave me the
                        80.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>STOKES: Incidentally, there was a small portion of the examination on
                    mathematics, only 2 points or something, but still I thought, oh, this is my
                    meat, finally something I really know something about. And do you know I got the
                    lowest grade on that and the reason, in retrospect, it was a sometimes always
                    never, the person writing the examination had in mind Euclidean geometry, linear
                    algebra. There are branches of mathematics in which anything is sometimes true,
                    and I always thought, oh I know this true in the far out reaches of imaginary
                    variables, oh boy. But that isn't the way it was graded.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The examiner didn't know about that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STOKES: Well, whatever. But anyway, I think the important thing here is that I
                    began as a maverick in the foreign service. I always felt myself a maverick.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mean all the way through?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STOKES: Yes, because the patterns of thought, the ways of thinking, the
                    motivation just all seemed to me that I was never quite in sync with what the
                    mainstream of the foreign service was. But it was a creative tension. I was
                    accepted. I felt accepted and I felt I had a contribution, but I always saw it
                    as something which would be like a grain of sand in the oyster. I think in
                    retrospect the foreign service might have been more open to the utility of
                    making use of persons of scientific attainment, not in some highly specialized
                    job, necessarily, but in ways of thinking about broad issues of foreign affairs
                    in which scientific elements would have some point. In any event, at the Foreign
                    Service Institute we were asked what assignments we wanted, to illustrate this
                    maverick sort of thing, I asked for Mukden, China because I saw it as a place
                    where five or six cultures were in contest and very likely the flash point for
                    the conflict of great power interest. Again as it had been before.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now those were China, Japan, Soviet Union, who else?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STOKES: The United States, Korea, Mongolia, not as great powers but as
                    participating cultures that would be effected by what happened in that cockpit.
                    I was the only one in the class to get the request fulfilled because people had
                    asked for Paris, Rome, London. In any case it was a time of enormous shortage of
                    personnel so that there was no time to train me at all in language or
                    anything.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you had zero Chinese at that stage.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>STOKES: Zero. I remember a seminal month spent in Chinese Affairs with Art
                    Hummel's cousin, I forget his first name, John Carter Vincent and Jim Penfield
                    and many of the greats and I remember being given an old desk and when I opened
                    it to get a piece of paper I saw George Atcheson's commission that he had
                    forgotten, left there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mean Dean?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STOKES: George Atcheson. He was political advisor to MacArthur. In any event, the
                    only way to get to China in those days, well let me back track. I have a
                    wonderful memory of being entrusted with the great seal of the United States and
                    a book of drafts on the Secretary of State and I was free to write a check in
                    any amount at any time theoretically. It was an enormous sense of power to have
                    been selected to go forth and to accomplish this. It was the fulfillment of my
                    hopes. And there had even been some semblance of that in my trainee status. I
                    remember one night John Carter called me in and said the President wants to
                    release the Pauliy report about Russian removals of equipment in China. I'd like
                    you to look through it and by tomorrow morning tell me if there is anything that
                    we ought not to release. This was a 1500 page report, so I stayed up all night
                    feeling very powerful and significant and at 5:00 a.m. as I was rushing back to
                    the State Department to deliver my report, I heard the newspaper boy saying
                    extra, extra, read all about it, President releases the Pauliy report. So that's
                    a metaphor for a lot of things that happened between the White House and the
                    State Department.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you returned to your usual height, you were no longer a
                        giant.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STOKES: Right. We had to arrange our own travel to China in those days all I
                    could find was a freighter leaving New York via the Panama Canal and the whole
                    trip took 32 days. I remember as we pulled away from the pier I went down to my
                    little midshipman's cabin there was a one-armed gentleman there. He asked me who
                    I was and where I was going and he said “Your going to China”, and he addressed
                    me in Chinese. And I said, “I'm sorry I don't know any.” He said “You don't know
                    any Chinese and you're going to northeast?” He said, “Sit down in that chair
                    over there” and for the next 32 days I received non-stop force feeding in
                    Chinese. I hated that gentleman's guts when the ship was tilting 30 degrees and
                    wallowing in heavy seas and my stomach wanted to go one way and I the other. On
                    and on it came, but I revered that man. He transformed my life in China from
                    being one of a bored outsider to being one of a participant and it heightened my
                    awareness and gave me eyes to see with and ears to hear. It was a priceless
                    gift.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was another passenger?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>STOKES: Yes. As I learned later, Dr. Rubin Torre. You see what an impression I
                    made in me. He was a famous, renown Presbyterian missionary in China. He was
                    returning after a long period of prison camp under the Japanese and he's widely
                    known and I'm happy to record my thanks to him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is it '45 still or '46 now?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STOKES: '46. I landed in Shanghai. I remember getting up before dawn and standing
                    in the bow of the freighter coming in up the Hwang Pu. And before we hit land
                    you could see the dark fishing boats go by with the great big eyeballs on the
                    prow, and as we came up the Wusong in front of the Bund in Shanghai I could see
                    the relic of the scuttled Italian battleship, the Balboa. In Shanghai I was
                    asked to remain for three months to issue visas to the German Jewish refugees in
                    Hong Kong. That was a crash program. We issued a thousand emigration visas a
                    month. John Stegmaier, John Stutesman and J.B. Pilcher was the Consul General .
                    We all lived together in a flat underneath T.V. Soong's flat in a development
                    building because at that time the power of the dollar was such that when even
                    six impecunious American Vice Consuls pooling their dollars could buy a good
                    portion of the city. But there again since I spoke some Chinese I could
                    immediately make Chinese friends and began thinking as the Chinese would think
                    or getting an insight into how they would think. At the end of three months I
                    flew up the coast in a Navy plane, stopping at Tsingtao at the naval base and
                    Dick Service was Consul there of the famous Services and I became just airsick
                    and he took me in and we spend some time there at his home, I think two or three
                    days, memorable days. The Navy then flew me up to Mukden on a regular supply
                    run. I remember being met at the plan as we landed by a young American
                    lieutenant who leaped into the plane and looked around ignoring me and looked at
                    the cargo and said, “Damn it, where's our beer, what's all this stuff?”, kicking
                    the personal effects of the Consul General that I had carefully seen was loaded
                    on board instead of his shipment of beer. That lieutenant was John K. Singlaub
                    who later became Deputy Commander in Korea and was canned by President Carter
                    for insubordination and became leading spokesman of the American right wing.
                    More about Singlaub later. He was commander of external survey detachment number
                    44 which anybody can guess correctly what that was. Mukden turned out to be
                    everything that I had hoped for in terms of strife and struggle. At that time
                    the American consulate had been open for only about six months. Because while
                    the Soviet Army had occupied Manchuria it refused to allow American
                    representation there. The Soviet Army was obliged to withdraw by United Nations
                    remonstrations and the National Army had been flown up into Manchuria and
                    brought up by rail with US Marine guards and was in conflict with the Chinese
                    communist armies that circled around from Yen'an through the provinces bordering
                    on Mongolia and had to fill the vacuum left by the surrender of the
                    Japanese.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Exactly when are we taking about now?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>STOKES: We're talking about the period immediately following VJ Day and the
                    Japanese surrender.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Fall of '45.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STOKES: Yes. When I arrived, the Civil War was in full tilt. The Chinese armies
                    were the American-trained crack armies from the Burma road, the Stilwell
                    trainees and American equipped armies and the Chinese communists were not yet
                    fully understood to be as redoubtable as they later proved to be. But in any
                    case my entire assignment there was in the midst of civil war which, as events
                    turned against the government, became more and more in the immediate environs of
                    the city in which I was living and working.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you actually doing in the office?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STOKES: I began as Administrative and Consular Officer and then later became
                    Economic Officer and then as our staff dwindled, I was really the right hand, or
                    in effect if the consulate has a DCM, that's what I would have been considered.
                    You remember in those days career officers succeeded one another in charge of
                    the office without regard to the seniority of staff officers and I was after the
                    Consulate General, Angus Ward. I was the only career officer there, I was brand
                    new. In any case, I should mention that Secretary Acheson, and this was highly
                    classified at the time, certainly cannot be now, was interested in exploring the
                    possibility of a Modus vivendi with the Chinese communists when it became
                    evident.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He would have been Under Secretary then wouldn't he?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STOKES: I think he became Secretary of State by that time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Still in '45?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STOKES: No I arrived in December of 1946. I've skipped over a lot of time. So
                    Acheson is Secretary at that time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So then you had Burns, and then Marshall...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>STOKES: So then the Marshall executive headquarters team was there while I was
                    there and General Wedemeyer came. As the national armies and government
                    experience was turning sour, there were more and more high level American
                    missions trying to ascertain why this was the case. Incidentally, I studied
                    Chinese assiduously at this time informally, at my own expense and my teacher
                    was the daughter of the Kuomintang mayor in absentia of Harbin. She was a very
                    gifted woman, by the way, very gifted, and she made learning Chinese a delight.
                    Entirely platonic, of course, I don't say of course, but it was. In any case, to
                    illustrate something of the tenor of the times, she said “have you ever thought
                    of holding a dance in your house?” I said “Well, I don't know.” She said “There
                    are a lot of Chinese who would like to come.” and I said “Well what would I do,
                    just play these records?” She said “Yes, that's all, move the furniture back and
                    so forth.” So I did this thinking of maybe 10 or 12 people and she said “I'll
                    invite my friends.” Well about the time of the party all of a sudden limousines
                    and all kinds of vehicles began appearing in front of my house. There was the
                    Garrison Commander, a three-star general and his wife, the president of the
                    central bank and his wife. It was something absolutely incredible, and they
                    seemed to have some arrangement themselves where they rotated through the house.
                    By midnight we must have had 200 people at various times in this little, modest,
                    rundown house, and what I realized later that the Generalissimo had decreed that
                    in time of civil war there would be no frivolous activities like dancing. The
                    leadership's families were very restive under this, but then they decided in a
                    very Chinese way that well, of course, they were absolutely dutiful to the
                    government's instruction. The government had also instructed them to be nice to
                    the Americans. And so they felt that the greater good was served in this
                    way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But weren't there a lot of American military units
                        around?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STOKES: No, no American military units.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you were the only American, official presence, the
                        Consulate was?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>STOKES: Yes, except for this shadowy external survey detachment which we can all
                    guess what it was. In any case, Secretary Acheson had wanted to seek a Modus
                    vivendi or explore the possibilities of a Modus vivendi with the Chinese
                    communists. So we were all secretly asked if we wanted to volunteer to remain
                    behind in case the city should fall to the communists. And I volunteered. In the
                    Fall of 1948 I was on a mission to Shanghai and I remember being hospitalized
                    there for some attack of nausea, something I ate I guess. In the middle of the
                    night I remember seeing a light coming down the hall and it was the orderly and
                    an MP and there was a telegram from Consul General Ward asking me to buy $12,000
                    worth of foodstuffs and to fly them up the next morning to Mukden. The MP gave
                    me a message from the naval commander at Tsingtao telling me that C-46s would be
                    landing at first light on the Shanghai airport. I had four hours to spend
                    $15,000 dollars. I got the Navy OD and we raced in a truck to the warehouse and
                    I went through saying $1,000 worth of that, $1,000 worth of that, $1,000 worth
                    of that. This convoy of trucks arrived at the airport just as the planes were
                    coming in. It was all thrown in. We flew to Tsingtao, and then on to Mukden. At
                    this time the city was falling and at the pre-flight briefing, Admiral Badger
                    appeared on the flight line to the consternation of the pilots and he put his
                    nose about one inch away from each pilots nose and turned and said “You are not
                    to be captured on this flight, do you understand me lieutenant?” And they said
                    “Yes, Admiral, Sir!” So we got in the plane, and we were flying there, and the
                    pilot said to me, “I'm going to give this sucker once quick once over and if the
                    agreed flare signal is not fired, I'm turning around and coming back and not
                    even poking my nose in there. I looked down as we arrived and I could see there
                    was my wife and Reeberg, the Administrative Officer there on the field, I said
                    “It's all right, go in, go in.” He said “Not until I see the flare.” No flare,
                    but to make a long story short, I prevailed on him to make a touchdown at least,
                    one plane, and as we were rolling along, Reeberg came standing up in the jeep at
                    a braked neck pace and he said “The damn thing won't go off, you see” and pulled
                    the trigger, and a green flare went between the engine itself and the pilots
                    right ear. Well, this tape would not stand a reproduction of what the pilot
                    said. But anyway, we got in. In pursuit of our instructions from the Secretary
                    to try to make an opening to the communist authorities as soon as the hubbub
                    died down of the occupation by the Chinese, I telephoned the mayoralty and I
                    managed to raise a clerk or some appropriate person and to my astonishment they
                    accepted the offer of the Consul General to call on the mayor.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The communist mayor.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>STOKES: The communist mayor. We were not at all sanguine that there would be any
                    willingness on their part to do this because we had the optic of the monolithic
                    world communism and the subservience to the Soviet Union of all communist
                    parties everywhere. When the Consular General and I arrived there we were
                    ushered into a waiting room and we saw on the couch opposite us the head of the
                    Soviet Trade Commission and his deputy who was the senior Soviet official there.
                    And there were a lot of cigarette butts around showing that they'd been there a
                    long time. We thought we're in for one of these interminable waits. Well, the
                    door opened to the mayor's office, and the Russians all stood up and the man in
                    the mayor's office walked right by them as though they didn't exist and said Mr.
                    Consular General and Consul Stokes, would you please come in. Well, you should
                    have seen the look on them. I could hardly look at the Russians as I went by
                    because they'd have spit nails if they could have. The mayor said yes, we are
                    interested in a reasonable, mutually respectful relationship. We have to rebuild
                    this country, most of the equipment is Japanese, you are occupying Japan. The
                    reality is we need to get along. So the Consul General pressed his luck and
                    talked about a diplomatic courier and talked about the rights of American
                    businessmen and there was a reasonable response to all of this. So when we came
                    back to the consulate we could hardly contain our euphoria and we sent off
                    reports of just exactly what had been said. Then the phone rang and to my
                    astonishment the mayor wanted to pay a return call on the consulate. And he did
                    come. The conversation continued. And the next day, we wanted local currency, so
                    I went down to the central bank and asked to speak to the new head to the
                    central bank and he gave us more of the economic reasons for collaboration and
                    promised to expedite our reasonable needs. So when we went back to the consulate
                    we were making all kinds of plans and in came a special messenger with a
                    notification from the Garrison Commander to surrender all of our radio
                    equipment. And we thought, well, you know, that's in the context of what's
                    happening, this is nothing threatening, but we sent the proper reply as
                    requested but explained that we could not release the equipment because it was
                    the property of the US government and we needed to ask instructions and see that
                    this was the right thing to do. Following which came a phone call telling us
                    that the former Consul General must appear within 30 minutes before the Garrison
                    Commander. And we went over wondering what was happening. What did this mean,
                    former Consul General? The Garrison Commander turned out to be Wu Shu Twang, who
                    later was the foreign minister of the communist government and the man who at
                    Lake Success threw the riot act. He looked at the Consul General. “You have one
                    hour to have all the radio equipment in your office in the hands of my staff.”
                    The Consul General remonstrated, at which the Garrison Commander got up and
                    walked out. So the next day was a work day, we were all fully at work, at noon,
                    there were visitors to the consulate, and staff was fully at work.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You didn't deliver the equipment?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>STOKES: No we didn't, but the Consulate General said I promise to send a message
                    reporting this to my government and the governments will speak to each other.
                    The next day as we were at work, someone excitedly came up to me from USIS,
                    saying some of our guests in the library went to walk out and there were troops
                    there forcing them back in. And then someone came in saying there are commissars
                    here to see you and we were informed that we were violating the laws, we were
                    under house arrest. And there began 13 months incommunicado. The lights went
                    out, the telephones went dead, the water stopped, and there we were 75 people in
                    an office building. Chinese, foreigners, locals, Americans, anyone who was
                    there, an 85-year old money trader named Bodinghouse, I remember him very well.
                    And he said “On my way home for lunch, I thought, I am five minutes early, I
                    will stop in and read that article in the Atlantic Monthly that I could not
                    finish last week. And then I will be just in time for lunch.” So he put it down
                    and said “Ach, das is a gut article.” And he went out the door and a bayonet was
                    in his stomach. That was 13 months that you'd just sit there. He and I played
                    thousands of games of chess, it got so that when he raised his right hand I
                    could tell where he was going to move. But in any case, what I was able to put
                    together after the whole event was that a great struggle was going on in the
                    central committee of the Chinese communist party. On one side the President
                    Yu-Xiao Ji and Zhou En-lai, the moderates, and Mao on the other.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Zhou a moderate, theoretically, at that point.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STOKES: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So he represented what the mayor had told you.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STOKES: That's right, exactly. And the overall commander in the northeast at that
                    time, military and political, was Gao Gang who was a member of the central
                    committee. And the new mayor of Mukden was the personal assistant of Gao Gang.
                    He was certainly not acting on his own. Chinese never act on their own. In this
                    case we could trace why. Gao Gang was later imprisoned and executed and one of
                    the reasons was related to this, I'm sure. And what had happened was that Mao
                    Zedong I believe aspired to leadership of the communist world to succeed Stalin.
                    He was planning a visit to Moscow to arrange this with Stalin because,
                    triumphant after the victory in China, he felt this was what he was entitled to.
                    I won't go into all of this because I wrote it in extent in an industrial
                    college paper called the Future between America and China.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So that is available in that library?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STOKES: That is available in the Industrial College library. There are also
                    articles based on that in various places including one in the Foreign Service
                    Journal in about 1965.</p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STOKES: Yes. But the key thing I wanted to point out is that the struggle that
                    came out in the open once again on the death of Mao the Deng Xiaoping reforms of
                    1978/79 and what has followed, the anti-Mao campaign. All of this had its roots
                    in that period, it had its forerunners. It was a constant struggle that was
                    going on within the Chinese leadership and it was manifested in the events that
                    we were encountering.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is it your impression that that same struggle is still
                        continuing basically?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STOKES: Yes, I think Li Peng and Yang Shang Kun are now presently in power are
                    clearly the inheritors of the Mao tradition. In fact, when Ed Vig and I were in
                    China last January and we were in the city of Si Xian, we were accompanied by
                    two members of the Chinese travel service, who were always employees of state
                    security.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was last year?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STOKES: In January 1991 and I deliberately engaged them, though I could have
                    traveled on my own, because I wanted to avoid any sense that I was up to
                    anything. Because I have a long history going back that we'll see later. I
                    remember reading with consternation one morning that the general secretary of
                    the party Chang Zse-tun had spoken to the leaders of the Liberation Army and
                    said it's important that the Army follow the dictates of the party and the way
                    you can do this best is by following the thoughts of Mao Zedong. If I'd had
                    false teeth I'd have swallowed them because nothing good had been said about Mao
                    Zedong for ten years, the ten years I'd been working in China for AT Karney as
                    their director. It's as though the Pope had suddenly exposed Marxism. It was the
                    way you'd think of it. And the members of the China travel service, when I asked
                    them if they'd seen this, and I told them what it was, they looked as though I'd
                    gone out of my mind. And when I showed them the paper they talked excitedly for
                    half an hour in Chinese about what did all that mean. It was as unthinkable to
                    them as it was to me. So we're going back again. It's a constant back and forth.
                    I'd like to return for sake or orderliness the narrative to this period of house
                    arrest which to shorten things, when on for some thirteen months. Later when I
                    asked the people, Mr. Butterworth, the Assistant Secretary, what there feelings
                    had been when they had heard that we were under arrest, he said, “Well, we
                    didn't want to act too stridently because your reports of your success in
                    creating a Modus vivendi were so exciting, so promising, that we didn't want to
                    act in the dark until we knew better.” But then of course after several months
                    of absolute silence and no communication of any kind.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You weren't permitted any communication?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STOKES: No, even if you came near the window a sentry would point a rifle at you
                    and arm the device.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No additional food?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STOKES: Nobody in or out, nothing. They took out the Chinese one by one and gave
                    them a going over, and finally ordered them all under pain of whatnot, not to
                    have anything to do with us. So at that point I had to do all of the
                    interpreting between the Chinese and Consul General.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He did not have Chinese?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STOKES: No, he didn't know any. Trained language officer, Ralph Rinden had, the
                    day before the last plane went out, just left on the last plane without orders
                    because he could see that things, I guess, were just going bad. Again, this was
                    very helpful to me to gain some insight into the Chinese way of thinking. The
                    Consul General found it frustrating that they were speaking in a language that
                    he couldn't grasp so I remember at one crucial moment he addressed them in
                    Russian, which he spoke fluently, having been Consular in Moscow, and Consular
                    General in Vladivostok. And you can almost never see the Chinese blush. I mean
                    that's very difficult, I mean that's very difficult for a westerner to recognize
                    but I could see the ear of the leading Chinese redden when he heard the Russian.
                    Whether he understood it or not he turned to me and shifting from polite to very
                    vulgar Chinese he said something in the effect of “What is that old
                    son-of-a-bitch trying to say to me?” So the issue of language and rapport was
                    really very crucial.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So he was blushing with anger, not with
                        embarrassment?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STOKES: No, fury, I think. October first, 1949, the Chinese communists set up a
                    government of the people's republic. We remember that we could see what was
                    happening in the streets although we were under house arrest and there were
                    great parades and everything else. We had no radio but I could tell from the
                    Chinese papers generally what was happening and they sent a circular note to the
                    Western missions in Beijing asking for recognition. The United States organized
                    a response saying not as long as you are holding diplomats hostage.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where there other foreigners being held hostage in
                        Mukden?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>STOKES: No, the French were free, the British were free, you could see them
                    walking in the street. I'm sure they were followed and harassed but they were
                    free. So just about this time an old Chinese who had been caught asleep by the
                    Consul General and was ordered out to some remote part of the consulate came in
                    one day to ask for his retirement money. I was talking to Mr. Ward at the time
                    in his office, he got up, he was told that this man was coming and Ward went out
                    and took him by the ear and led him down the stairs and the Chinese was
                    frightened and began screaming and when Ward got to the bottom of the stairs,
                    there was the mass Chinese staff confronting the Consul General and the door
                    then burst open and in came the Chinese guards and they arrested Ward and any
                    Americans that were close to him, carried him off to jail.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because of that incident, or did they use that incident
                        just as a pretext?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STOKES: In the context of the Chinese desire for recognition in Beijing and the
                    response in retrospect the Chinese decided, okay we're going to get rid of the
                    Americans. Now this isn't worth it any more, its been going on too long, and
                    what will we do with them anyhow, eventually. So they wanted some kind of
                    pretext in order to get rid of us. And here's how it happened. Ward was in jail
                    and there was going to be a trial and I was in charge of the office, such as it
                    was, while he was away. For a year we had been sending messages of protest
                    signed by the Consul General addressed to the Secretary of State with succeeding
                    numbers and everything else and what we could do is give them to the Chinese to
                    send.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: To the officer outside the door.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STOKES: Yes, you would never hear anything, they were never sent. So I wrote a
                    message saying all is well and I am confident that the Consul General is being
                    well treated, signed Stokes and I give it the next number. And this one,
                    unaccountably, they sent. So the State Department when they got it, that it was
                    signed by me and not Ward and that my statement that I'm sure the Consul General
                    is well, it looked innocuous, I guess, to the Chinese but it said a lot to the
                    department. In any case there was then a trial, the Consul General was sentenced
                    to ten years at hard labor.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was all public then, his trial would have been public
                        so people in Washington knew about it right?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STOKES: Well there were no reporters or anything, but I kept sending reports,
                    because I was invited to be an observer at the trial. I went and they were now
                    sending what I sent, although what I sent was meant trying to get through the
                    censorship.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But they did send them to Washington?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STOKES: Yes, and I'll never forget they were giving the sentence in Chinese and
                    then it was being translated in English and while they were reading it in
                    English for the detainees they were reading the next in Chinese at the same
                    time. And Ward said “I heard my being sentenced to ten years at hard labor and I
                    saw a silly grin appear on your face, Stokes, I thought, this kid will do
                    anything to earn Charg� pay.” But what I was hearing in Chinese was that but
                    because of the particular heinousness of the office the additional penalty of
                    immediate expulsion from the peoples republic is levied and we were. In fact,
                    when the Consul General got back the next day, a Chinese came to the door and
                    said there is going to be a trial of American spies, do you wish to attend?
                    You're free to attend or not. And I checked with Ward and he said well why not
                    go and see what it's about. And there was a trial of personnel who were
                    allegedly left behind by the external survey detachment headed by Lieutenant,
                    then Captain, Singlaub and they had masses of one-time pads, gold rings,
                    Army/Navy type transmitters and camouflage gear and everything else you could
                    imagine. The attempt was made to sort of link the consulate to this work. We
                    were then taken by truck at midnight to the railway station and put under guard
                    on a train and it took us three days to reach the city of Tianjin. We were
                    turned over to Al Wellborn who was Consul General there and then sent out. While
                    we were hostages, Mao made his famous visit to Moscow for his meeting with
                    Stalin in which I think we had this contributory role in some way. Stalin
                    treated him very shabbily and the agreement that came out of that was even worse
                    for the communist government than the agreement in 1945 that Stalin had
                    negotiated with Chiang Kai-shek. So the myth of Chinese/Russian solidarity and
                    eternal friendship under the banner of communism was to my mind absolutely
                    unraveled by the time all of this experience had come to a head. There is and
                    always has been a latent hostility between the Chinese and the Russians. It's
                    cultural, it's visceral. It goes way back.</p>

                </p>
                <p>STOKES: I think it has to do with it, like the relationship between the British
                    and the Irish in many ways. History has poisoned us in so many ways that it's
                    hard to say what comes first, but certainly the Chinese feel that Siberia was
                    seized from them when the Russian Army came to Manchuria. Just before we arrived
                    there they seized all kinds of Japanese assets and they transferred then to
                    Russian ownership, put Russian signs on them and tried to keep it as
                    property.</p>

                <p>STOKES: Well then factory equipment they stole, the Chinese don't have to invent
                    any reasons to. But Mao was prepared to swallow all of this until his
                    confrontation with Stalin. And then when he came back, of course, it was such a
                    loss of face because he had put down Zhou En-lai and put Gao Gang to death. The
                    people that wanted to work with the Americans, to build up Chinese industry when
                    we had promised to do that, and probably would have, and of course the chairman
                    of the communist party is never wrong, so Mao then felt the need to move on to
                    things like the Great Leap Forward and the cultural revolution, all the final
                    errors that demolished the last vestige of his historical reputation in an
                    attempt to salvage the earlier mistake.</p>

                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>STOKES: '62. And by that time they had asked the Russians to leave and when
                    Khrushchev replaced Stalin there was the final split between the two. The ironic
                    thing though is that the split had been with Stalin. It's just simply that
                    Khrushchevism, that is the idea of a movement to demystify and expose the faults
                    of the great leader, was something that Mao Zedong could only view at with
                    horror because the exposure of the faults of Mao would have been the analog to
                    that and of course we had the great expose of the faults of Mao in 1978 and '79
                    when Mao had died and Deng Xiaoping came in. We had the same kind of
                    Khrushchevian thing Chinese style. But now poor Li Peng and Yang Shang Kun are
                    trying to put all that back again, it won't work. And in talking to Chinese at
                    all levels of life in 1991 and today I can tell that is not going to wash. I
                    think the present situation in China is like the situation follow the death of
                    Brezhnev. The series of meaningless, statureless figures trying to pursue a
                    moribund policy that has utterly no credibility even in the party. So you say
                    what is holding it together? It's inertia. A Gorbachev hasn't surfaced yet. Zhao
                    Ziyang who has all of the tremendous qualities of Gorbachev is a prisoner. It's
                    important, I think, useful to recall how things appeared in June of 1990. China
                    had introduced private enterprise into agriculture successfully, China had
                    become self-sufficient in grain. Remember how it used to import millions of tons
                    from the United States. It had a reform program to invite foreign capital, it
                    was succeeding in building up its exports. Gorbachev came to China in order to
                    try to gain lessons, would never say so because the Russians presume themselves
                    the elder brothers, but there was everything to learn. All that Gorbachev wanted
                    to do in a communist context while keeping a communist regime in political power
                    was being done in China. However at the same time without Gorbachev knowing it,
                    the leaders of the great state enterprises that were being threatened by Zhao
                    Ziyang of curtailment of their subsidies mounted a palace coup and succeeded in
                    getting Zhao Ziyang secretly deposed as General Secretary of the party in May of
                    1990. When this happened, some of his followers sent word to the students,
                    you're free to express your frustrations in the street, and so the
                    demonstrations that lead to the Tiananmen massacre were not the pivotal event
                    which caused the change in China, but they were only a kind of post-event
                    manifestation, the part of the iceberg that could be seen above the water. Zhao
                    Ziyang, when he appeared to the students in Tiananmen said, “It's too late, I've
                    come too late”. The full meaning of that wasn't understood by the students
                    because there is an absolute rule of Omerta or silence in the Cosa Nostra vein,
                    which is the communist party leadership of China. So now China is a house of
                    cards waiting for some kind of collapse.</p>

                <p>STOKES: Well, anybody could give a number, but it will depend on factors of
                    readiness and the like, I think. It's widely said that the death of Deng
                    Xiaoping will do it. That's possible, but I can't really attach a lot of
                    significance. I'd like to add here for the record that following my release from
                    being a hostage I went on, Ural Alexis Johnson invited me to go to Tokyo to do
                    peripheral reporting on China and I spent two years there, among other things,
                    being interested very much in that I never lost an interest in China.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So that took you to '51 more or less?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STOKES: '52, yes and I'm trying to center this around China and not talk about
                    career movements. But I then went to Thailand as head of the counterinsurgency
                    effort and was dealing with a manifestation of Maoism because the insurgency was
                    Chinese sponsored, had Mao badges and Mao books and all of that, so that was
                    another seven years of study.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Bill, what was the level of your Chinese as this story
                        played itself out. Did you reach an S4 level for example?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STOKES: Can I pause in answering that to just sort of finishing the sequence. I'd
                    like to just outline my interest in China as they unfolded. After that
                    experience in Thailand, you know we were inspectors together, and one of my
                    assignments was to inspect.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But the inspection was '72 - '75, it was a lot later.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>STOKES: Well I came out of the six years in Thailand, ended in '73, then I became
                    inspector. But one of my inspection assignments was to inspect the liaison
                    mission in Beijing. Now President Bush was the head of it. When they submitted
                    my nomination at the State Department they were wondering what, in light of all
                    the previous excitement, would be the Chinese reaction because this was the
                    early period, Mao was still alive and the Chinese said why do you send us
                    someone connected with former events of this kind. They said, well we have
                    confidence in Mr. Stokes, and they accepted me then, for this limited purpose.
                    But when I left, the day I left was the 30 anniversary of the trials in Mukden,
                    and so on. This was printed in the Chinese press and you could see it seemed to
                    be another manifestation of the struggle of two groups within China whether to
                    let me in or protest it. The hard-liners and the cooperators were constantly
                    manifested. Not long thereafter, I left the foreign service and then I spent
                    five years in China traveling to China frequently for AT Karney and its
                    industrial development work, and wrote a book about manufacturing equity joint
                    ventures in China. I visited some 200 factories and spent days at each and all
                    over North China, gave seminars in all the big Chinese cities on how to
                    modernize industry and develop a market economy. I must say this was a priceless
                    way and period to get to know what is going on in Chinese society below the
                    surface and I think that some way we need to think of innovative ways to conduct
                    diplomacy on many planes other than just contacts with a foreign ministry, and
                    to do this by providing services and information. I have some ideas. There's no
                    time here to present them, but the idea of assigning this to intelligence
                    services and having people operating in a clandestine way I think is totally
                    discredited. It has residual toxins in it that lead, as did our experience in
                    Mukden, to poisoning the possibility for other collaborations. But we can find
                    overt and open ways to conduct diplomacy on many different functional levels so
                    that we are building something that can endure rather than hiding things that
                    for short term gains lead to long term loss. So the whole relationship between
                    China and America is an absolutely fascinating one and I think in the long run
                    is going to be pivotal in determining the future of the Pacific Basin. I have
                    great reservations about the concessions to the paper leadership that's in power
                    now. I don't feel that we need to go out of our way to pick quarrels, I think we
                    should have a clear idea that China is not represented by the individuals that
                    are being sent abroad by this regime. I feel very uneasy about sending
                    Eagleburger and Scowcroft clandestinely to Beijing at a time when the publicly
                    announced policy of the government was not to have any contact with the Chinese
                    leadership at or above the Assistant Secretary level. All this meant is that we
                    were telling the Chinese that we will tell our own public one thing and do other
                    things with them. That idea of clandestine maneuvering has profoundly adverse
                    long-term implications for our real interest. And the Chinese don't listen to
                    what you say, they listen to what you do and they draw conclusions from it that
                    we don't intend them to draw, but they do. So the important thing is not knowing
                    the Chinese language, it's understand how the Chinese interpret what happens. As
                    far as the level I attained, when I was using it in China, it was good, there
                    was never any chance to measure it, but I felt perfectly free. It was doing all
                    it needed to do and I had never a moment's classroom instruction. I think the
                    big thing in the language for me is to feel free to use it and there didn't seem
                    to be any hang-ups over misinterpretation of words.</p>

                </p>
                <p>STOKES: I recall that in our previous session we were interpreting the
                    experiences that I had in Manchuria with the divisions within the leadership of
                    the Chinese communist party. Although it was a consulate and not the embassy we
                    were pursuing as the lead office Secretary Acheson's desire to search for a
                    Modus vivendi with the Chinese communist leadership and Shenyang or Mukden was
                    the first city to fall under the Chinese communist sway. So, consequently, we
                    were dealing with the Chinese leadership as an object test on both sides of what
                    would be possible in terms of a Modus vivendi.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The US embassy was already in Beijing at this point?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>STOKES: No, it was in Nanking while I was in Shenyang. There was a Consulate
                    General in Beijing under Edmund Club. The Ambassador, Leighton Stuart was in
                    Nanjing credited to the national government. We recall that what we perceived
                    was at first in Shenyang was the friendly manifestation and expression of desire
                    for defacto relationships including businesses and courier and exchange of
                    visits between the Consul General and the mayor. The mayor was the right hand
                    man of Gao Gang who was the overall military and political leader in northeast
                    China, the most important part of China economically and politically, and the
                    place where the victory was won that broke the back of the national government
                    on the mainland, in fact, in the Daudung marshes. So we were not dealing with
                    some local uninstructed functionary. Gao Gang was a member not only of the
                    central committee, he was one of five of the top leaders. Gao Gang in
                    retrospect, and is manifested to us, clearly represents the international wing
                    of the party which included President Yu Show Gee and Zhou En-lai and the sudden
                    reversal of Gao Gang's policy that had us suddenly, one day without warning,
                    surrounded by troops and the electricity and water cut off and the beginning of
                    an incommunicado arrest, was clearly the result of Mao Zedong's personal
                    decision and stemming from his desire presumably to prepare for his meeting with
                    Stalin and his desire to obtain the overall leadership of the world communist
                    movement as a result of his successful revolution in China. But in an internal
                    sense, Mao has always represented the leader of what I would call, as opposed to
                    the internationalist wing, the continental wing. Someone who always saw the
                    peasants as the basis for success of his party and the idea of movements within
                    China was his expertise. The little red book is all about how to conduct
                    guerrilla warfare against a major land power that was in charge of the territory
                    in which you were located. What was very interesting was to see how adroit Mao
                    was in areas that involved awareness of international realities - for example,
                    what broke the back of the Chinese economy was the Great Leap Forward which was
                    Mao's belief that the whole array of economic problems that China faced and this
                    desire for modernism could be addressed purely by the will and the discipline of
                    the people as guided by the central committee, mainly Mao himself. So the Great
                    Leap Forward was manifested largely by an order from the central committee, that
                    every village would have its own steel mill. And so crudely they began
                    everywhere throwing scrap iron onto fires stocked with soft coal. It produced
                    unusable stuff, of course. Tremendous pollution and diversion of effort and
                    everything else. It was at that time that the Chinese Air Force began reporting
                    a breakdown in its Soviet provided air fleet and Chinese copies of MiGs needing
                    spare parts, maintenance, supplies and lubricants and so on and Mao's reply to
                    that was, that isn't the way you solve problems, read the little red book and
                    apply the thoughts of Mao Zedong and don't ask us these things. So with this
                    background I'd like to recall some of my experiences beginning in 1964 that
                    dealt with an external view of the struggle within the Chinese communist party.
                    Experience in Mukden was seeing it from the inside of the country, the other was
                    from the outside.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just one question before we go on to that phase. In the
                        period when the local communists were first making their approaches to you,
                        were your activities under the close guidance of the embassy in Nanking and
                        was there any difference of view as to how the approach should be
                        handled.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STOKES: We had very little guidance from the embassy. We had guidance but Consul
                    General Ward was not really interested in following it. Mr. Ward had made the
                    friendship of Mr. Bullet during the Hoover relief mission in Russia. And Mr.
                    Bullet was Thomas Dewey's choice to be Secretary of State and Mr. Ward expected
                    to be the leader of the department under Bullet that is the top career man, so
                    he took a very reserved view to guidance he got not only from the embassy but
                    from the department. Mr. Ward's Consul Generalship sort of was a constant
                    running battle with the department and the embassy over a whole range of things
                    including whether his wife should be there or not, including matters of policy
                    as well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I wondered particularly because the embassy would still be
                        in close contact with the Nationalists and the Nationalists might have been
                        twisting their arms as to what you should or shouldn't do with the
                        communists.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STOKES: Yes, although by that time the administration was even more convinced
                    that the National Government was going to collapse. Mr. Ward represented the
                    conservative wing of the Republican party which felt more that the National
                    government should be strengthened at all costs, and General Wedemeyer came out
                    to regulate this issue or to investigate this issue and there were divisions
                    within the consulate over this of course. Mr. Ward was the boss, but if you
                    asked the young officers like Al Sebens and myself what our view was.
                    Interestingly Mr. Ward let us go on and write dispatches and so on. In fact,
                    with the defeat of Dewey he rather lost interest in what was going on. And by
                    that time it was very close to the actual collapse of the government so there
                    was very little guidance that Nanjing could provide anyway by that time.</p>
                <p>In 1964 I was assigned to the Industrial College of the Armed Forces for senior
                    training and the centerpiece, as you know Bill from your experiences, is the
                    time you have to write a thesis. Although I had been in the meantime in Japan
                    and then in North Africa, I never lost the fascination for what was happening
                    within China and I wrote my thesis on the future between America and China
                    involving a study of what two great powers facing each other over a whole array
                    of divisive issues. What, underneath all the tactical differences, was there in
                    the way of a common interest that might be explored in some reopening because
                    the mutual hostility that had dated since the Korean War obviously brought a
                    sterile deadlock on both sides on what they were able to accomplish.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You probably could not do a field trip to China in
                        connection with that thesis.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>STOKES: No, I wouldn't have been personally welcome there at all. As later events
                    turned out because, just parenthetically I mean, that when the department wanted
                    to send me to China as Inspector during the time of Mr. Bush's tenure there were
                    remonstrances from the Chinese foreign ministry which were overcome by the way,
                    but that's for a later part of the sequence. The thrust of this thesis was that,
                    in fact, there were major interests on both sides that had manifested themselves
                    earlier at the time Secretary Acheson's desire for detente and that as China was
                    also in a cul-de-sac and Mao had in fact been gravely disappointed in all the
                    reasons that he had had for frustrating this Modus vivendi, he had been repelled
                    by Stalin, and so forth. Interestingly, when I asked permission to publish this
                    article and send it to the Department for review, the Voice of America with my
                    permission, in fact my enthusiastic preference, for that rather than publication
                    was to translate it into Chinese and then broadcast it in installments to the
                    mainland.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did they do that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STOKES: Yes they did that, I still have the text, and later, when I was in
                    private business with AT Karney, I met two Chinese officials who had been part
                    of the external political interpretation apparat that said that they recalled
                    such a broadcast and a general conclusion of the party that the United States
                    was signaling a desire for better relations and looking for the beginning of the
                    resumption of some talks about a new relationship. That was really quite
                    satisfying and I think Dick Donalds who was in the VOA picked up this idea and
                    saw it through deserves a lot of credit for that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Has that been cleared with the Department of State so that
                        in effect there was a deliberate decision.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STOKES: Yes, well, all that I know is that I saw a copy of a decision by the
                    Bureau of Far Eastern Affairs approving a request by VOA to do this. To what
                    extent they had an ulterior motive or whether they just saw that no harm would
                    be done. I'm inclined to think the former because there was a general disbelief
                    among career officers that the systematic hostilities at China was the right
                    idea.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A disbelief in that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STOKES: Yes, and a desire, other things being equal, to find a relationship, but
                    an unwillingness to be seen as the author as an initiative to this effort
                    because so many China service officers have been crucified by McCarthy and
                    others.</p>

                <p>STOKES: Yes, but there was still plenty of that around. Mr. Robertson, and there
                    were many who were important political figures that had been assigned in Asian
                    Affairs, held that same view. So I think it was seen as a harmless way to try to
                    do something, that is, an undangerous way, to start to do something to cast
                    bread on the waters and see what would happen. Following that year at the
                    Industrial College I was assigned to the Air Force planning staff on loan from
                    the State Department. And one of my early duties I recall was to assist in the
                    negotiation for base rights in Southeast Asia and East Asia as a result of the
                    needs rising out of our increasing involvement in Vietnam. And so I was involved
                    in the negotiation with the Taiwan government for the Taichung airfield in
                    Taiwan. It was to be used by B52s for the Utapao base in Thailand. One of the
                    most interesting and ultimately significant assignments for me was to plan the
                    response from the Air Force's point of view to the Thai government's request
                    that a United States helicopter fleet of 100 Hueys and pilots be sent to
                    Northeast Thailand to help the Thai government deal with the Chinese sponsored
                    insurgency in Northeast Thailand, which coincidentally was just in the, not so
                    coincidentally, but was in the same vicinity as the place where our air base
                    network in Thailand was being located - near the Lao frontier which is an easy
                    reach of the Ho Chi Minh trail. At this time the State Department manifested the
                    beginning of what was to be the core of what I'd like to talk about. An
                    unwillingness to see reproduced in Thailand the same kind of direct involvement
                    and direct assumption of military responsibility that the United States was
                    conducting then in Vietnam.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: US military?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STOKES: US military. And the Thai request was in fact for a beginning of a direct
                    US military involvement in Thailand against a domestic threat. So at the same
                    time the US military wanted to be certain that its bases were secure and it was
                    perfectly ready to use its own military force for this purpose, and if the Thai
                    would invite us, so much the better. In fact, there were many low level
                    indications that I came across that the Thai and the US military saw eye to eye
                    on this issue. Whether the inspiration for the idea was purely Thai or a mixed
                    Thai/US military agreement, that was the thing that the Thai should ask the US
                    political leadership, I think is an open question.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the basis of the junior officer's opinion that in
                        Thailand the military should not ideally take over as in Vietnam?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>STOKES: Well I think I've tried to ask who in the US State Department was one of
                    the principal sources for this kind of what I consider trenchant and significant
                    and wise points of view. Leonard Unger who was Ambassador in Thailand through
                    most of this time, and DCM before, told me it was Marshall Green and I planned
                    to ask Marshall about this part of the piece that I'm trying to do on the Thai
                    insurgency. I should say at this point that the Thai insurgency unquestionably
                    was a Maoist insurgency inspired by Mao Zedong and his followers. The insurgents
                    were trained in China, they were Chinese or Sino-Thai. The little red book was
                    everywhere in their camps, and pictures of Mao were worn on caps by the
                    insurgents when they wore uniforms or insignia of any kind, and the insurgency
                    was supported from China by a clandestine radio broadcast that put the whole
                    thing clearly in a Maoist context. So this is really not an arguable point. The
                    insurgency was an eternal manifestation of Mao's continental policies and the
                    way he saw it, the Vietnamese were up again to their historical tricks of
                    creating areas of uncertainty on China's southeast frontier and China needed
                    participation in that area to stem the increase of Vietnamese influence. The
                    Mekong River and Northeast Thailand was clearly the frontier of Vietnamese
                    expansion. Ho Chi Minh, by the way, lived for many years on the Thai bank of the
                    Mekong, in Mekong Phnom which was the key air base for fighting for interdicting
                    the Ho Chi Minh trail.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When we come down to the present I want to have you cover
                        that same point about the present situation in Cambodia, the Chinese
                        position towards the Pathet Lao and the rest of it. But continue.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STOKES: So my perspective on this and I'm trying here to concentrate not so much
                    on what I think as what I immediately saw and the Air Force asked me to be the
                    action officer for this whole request of the Thai for the helicopter fleet. I
                    had served in the Air Force during World War II as you recall from the earlier
                    tape in the Air Weather Service and many of the colonels who led the Air Weather
                    Service and who were my immediate superiors had become lieutenants and four star
                    generals in the Air Force and were the Air Force leadership. So although I was a
                    simple exchange officer I was on close terms with people who were in the high
                    stratosphere and otherwise untouchable by people I normally dealt with on the
                    planning staff. The Air Force did not participate with the Army and Navy and the
                    Marines in thinking always in terms of direct US involvement. The Air Force was
                    the exposed service in Thailand and would much prefer to have been protected by
                    means that did not involve combat operations on the perimeter of their bases.
                    The department succeeded in obtaining an agreement within the US government on a
                    compromised reply to the Thai request for the helicopters - that we would
                    provide the helicopter capacity but it would be to exclude actual combat
                    operations. It would simply ferry Thai officials and groups into certain
                    areas</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: US pilots and crews?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>STOKES: US pilots and crews, and it would only be for a period of 120 days and on
                    the condition that the Thai nominated a sufficient number of pilots and ground
                    crew personnel for training at Fort Rucker in the United States, fly and
                    maintain the aircraft, following which the US pilots would be withdrawn, and all
                    US personnel would be withdrawn from the insurgency and the aircraft would be
                    turned over to the Thai.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's very interesting, we were reluctant then. We were
                        not reaching out to grasp this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STOKES: I think the US Army that did the training would have been very happy to
                    be directly involved, but Marshall Green, who at that time I believe was already
                    Assistant Secretary for East Asian Affairs, and if Mr. Unger is correct. In any
                    case, the State Department's voice was heard in the US government in the
                    decision to arrive at a compromise that we would provide the airlift but for a
                    brief period only. And it became the fundamental idea that what's happening in
                    Thailand is a Thai government responsibility, we would help them but not take on
                    their responsibilities.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Are we still in 64?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STOKES: 1964/65, the training I think was in early '65. I beg your pardon, in
                    late '65 I was assigned to the Air Force planning staff so that this must have
                    been in '66. On this assignment I want out to Thailand to be present at the
                    ceremony in which the Thai pilots came back from the United States and there was
                    a turnover of the helicopters and the responsibility to the Thai. I went out
                    there early and flew on several of the missions of transportation to make
                    certain that the condition that there was no combat hazard involved. This whole
                    ceremony occurred at the Mekong Phnom air base which is right on the Mekong, you
                    can see Laos from there and the Ho Chi Minh trail was barely over the
                    horizon.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So the Thai base already existed, it did not involve
                        building a new base?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STOKES: There was a rudimentary base there. The US bases in Thailand represented
                    a massive construction effort. Astounding. From little airfields were made
                    monstrous bases.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But that was later.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>STOKES: No, this was at the time, remember my first duty was to develop the base
                    rights and we began building B-52 basin U Tapao where there had been nothing,
                    and greatly expanding the flights. See the US Air Force was flying into
                    bombardment missions in Vietnam from these bases by late 1964. So when I went
                    out to Thailand it was to an established US base from which there were combat
                    operations in Vietnam plus helicopter missions in Thailand in support of the
                    Thai, but transport missions, not combat missions. These were unarmed
                    helicopters, by the way, no mini guns or anything</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So it was involvement in internal conflict that was the
                        question?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STOKES: That was the issue. The involvement in Vietnam was already heavy, so in
                    any case the main point I'm trying to report here is the way in which China was
                    trying to manifest it's Maoist continental thrust through the insurgency in
                    Thailand and the way our reaction to it was firm but guarded so that from the
                    Chinese point of view we were not involved in a resumption of the direct
                    hostilities with China. We were both acting through surrogates, so to speak,
                    behind surrogates.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was that part of the deliberate plan, or intention or wish
                        that we not sidle into an open conflict there with China?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>STOKES: My impression is that the overriding objective was that we would not
                    expand to Thailand Vietnam-type hostilities. That it was not necessary or
                    appropriate or useful for our purposes. Much lower down on the scale and related
                    to it was that we did not want to be directly involved in hostilities, not only
                    with the Viet Cong or North Vietnam, but with China either if this did not
                    involve damage to a profound interest or a major US interest. Moreover there was
                    the wise and far-seeing historically supported or proven later belief that the
                    best way to deal with the insurgency in Thailand was to help the Thai government
                    focus on its own inadequacies and the inappropriateness of its policies in the
                    effected rural areas and by the making of Thailand, transforming it from a city
                    state based around Bangkok, to a nation state that incorporated effective
                    presence in its outlying areas, especially its frontiers with Laos and China and
                    Burma, that there would emerge a linchpin against the domino theory. In fact
                    that is in the hindsight now of 15 or more years, it's 25 years rather, it is
                    perfectly evident that Thailand has fulfilled all those hopes and objectives.
                    The Thai economy has prospered. The thrust of our policy was to help them
                    develop an academy to train their district officers, help them develop a system
                    to build roads into these areas, to help them with modernizing the police,
                    creating adequate compensations and rewards so that the systemic exploitation of
                    the local economy would not be really necessary, that there were alternatives to
                    it. During this ceremony of the turnover to the Thai there was also present
                    Ambassador Graham Martin who, while seen as pro-military, was really much closer
                    to the US Air Force than to any of the other branches. He had been faculty
                    advisor at the Air War College at Maxwell Field, and developed a lot of those
                    relationships. So that between the chief of staff of the Air Force and the air
                    planning staff and Ambassador Martin and Marshall Green and the State Department
                    there was a kind of community of a weight that could deal with the hard-liners
                    and CIA and the US Army and the Marine Corps after I returned from Thailand.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Bill, in that reference, what were the particular battles
                        that were being fought with these alignments of people.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STOKES: I'd like to come to that, may I, because I'm coming to how I went to
                    Thailand and then I can tell you about things I know first hand about. I came
                    back and was sitting at my desk in the Pentagon and I picked up the phone there
                    was a very soft voice, I could hardly make out, best as I could hear in all that
                    noise, he says (muffled) “Stokes, this is Graham Martin.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The spider.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>STOKES: And I didn't know what to say, I thought someone must be pulling my leg
                    and I didn't want to say “Who?”, but I managed somehow to keep my equanimity and
                    he said I would like you to come out to Thailand and head our counterinsurgency
                    program. He said Peer DeSilva from the agency is heading it now but he is not
                    well and we need to be thinking about ultimately a successor. And I told him I'd
                    be delighted to do that. In fact I was blown off my feet because I didn't expect
                    anything like that. The job is one that had to be approved by the Joint Chiefs
                    and the CIA and the national security apparatus and a foreign service officer
                    was not really seen as a candidate. Generals were, and Peer DeSilva had been in
                    Vietnam, and so on. In any case Graham Martin in the mean time was transferred,
                    Leonard Unger was named and he decided that he would keep the assignment and
                    that I would work for him in the same capacity that Graham Martin did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So Graham Martin was in Bangkok at that stage?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STOKES: Yes, in Bangkok.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was later that he went to....</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STOKES: Yes, as a result of his transfer, he was succeeded by Leonard Unger. When
                    I came out to Bangkok to work in this capacity, it was sometime before it was
                    finally realized that. That's unimportant here. The State Department and the
                    office of counterinsurgency in the embassy was determined to pursue the policy
                    earlier identified in connection with the helicopters, that there would be no
                    direct US involvement, that we would help strengthen the Thai and everywhere
                    manifest the Thai responsibility. Before I get deeply into that I want to tie up
                    this whole question of what perspective did all this offer on what was happening
                    in China and the Chinese leadership. The Maoist insurgency in Thailand was as I
                    say a pluperfect Maoist operation from beginning to end. It did not represent a
                    desire for an opening to the outside which is the tendency that we had first
                    encountered and we were looking for a revival of. So the fact that the
                    insurgency was frustrated at every turn successfully by the American policy as
                    the Thai successfully carried it out, was in fact a severe frustration of the
                    Maoist tendency in China, and represented a on a much smaller scale of course.
                    But it was another one of the series of failures of Maoist continental thought
                    to further Chinese aims. So that by 1976 when Mao had died and Deng Xiaoping had
                    come into power, in the whole array of things, this failure of Maoism was one of
                    the many, many reasons that led Dung to feel that the internationalist point of
                    view, in fact the Modus vivendi with the United States, was one that would
                    better serve China's interest than what Mao had been pursing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would assume that this cockpit was one of the major
                        fields of Chinese interest and activity in the foreign field at that
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>STOKES: Yes, I think so, because remember the continentalist concept - Mao was
                    most interested in things to which he had a direct land connection. And its
                    important to remember that Thailand has an intimate historical connection with
                    China. The Thai are originally from the Yellow River Basin and there are more
                    than a million Thai residents in China right now. They are one of the most
                    significant minorities in Thailand.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But they don't have any citizenship in China, they're not
                        Thai citizens in China?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STOKES: No, they're regarded strictly as Chinese, absolutely. And of course the
                    main Thai exodus was back to the 13th and 14th century. But in China that's not
                    ancient history. Its relatively modern history.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do they still speak Thai?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STOKES: In China, oh yes, absolutely. And on top of that, almost the entire
                    commercial life of Thailand which is thriving is ethnic Chinese who have come to
                    Thailand by way of the sea from Fujian and Swatow and the South China ports, and
                    have settled in Thailand and intermarried. And the Thai, unlike the other
                    southeast Asian nations, have accepted the Chinese providing that they follow
                    three main themes, that is they will revere the king and speak Thai, use Thai
                    language publicly and will support or acknowledge or at least make some
                    arrangement with the Buddhist religion. The Chinese have done this. As a result
                    you don't have any of the pogroms at all; in fact the Thai king is himself a
                    Sino-Thai in that General Taksin that overthrew the Burmese invaders and whose
                    son was the first monarch in the Chakri Dynasty, General Taksin was half
                    Chinese. So that's simply a symbol of all this. So that Thailand represents for
                    China not merely another southeast Asian state, it is a place where China, its
                    an overseas, it can be seen by the Chinese as one of its most important overseas
                    Chinese areas of interest, so that the insurgency there represented rather big
                    and interesting stakes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Chinese are not excluded from some areas of activity
                        in Thailand as they are in the Philippines?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STOKES: No they're members of the cabinet...</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I know in the Philippines, because of this, overseas the
                        Chinese have almost a monopoly of retailing. They are by law excluded from
                        retailing in the Philippines. Noting like that in Thailand?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>STOKES: On Chinese New Year, which has nothing to do whatever with any Thai
                    holiday, every store is shut. The city shuts down commercially and no issue is
                    made of that. That's the way the Thai succeed, they don't make issues where
                    issues are not necessary. I'd like now to come to your very interesting question
                    of whether and how this military desire for direct involvement manifested
                    itself. One day, a report was received that there would be a Viet Cong attack on
                    the US air bases and in fact the attack did manifest itself in a preliminary way
                    by confirmed intelligence that it was coming, misproduced a tremendous flap. We
                    had 41,000 Americans in these bases at this time and crucial operational
                    interests. The Joint Chiefs wanted to send a regimental combat team of marines
                    to guard in the Mekong Phnom especially which was to be the target for this
                    attack. Remember, it's just across the river from Laos, practically on the
                    river. This would have signaled the end of the department's policy because one
                    thing leads to another. You know how those things go. Use of force provokes
                    force then there's no way to stop it, you're down the ski slope. So the
                    Ambassador, with the support of the department...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Unger, now?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STOKES: Yes, put his foot down and said, absolutely not, and he said that he was
                    constituting a committee that would consist of myself as chairman and the Air
                    Force Commander and the Army Commander as members. We called on the Thai Chief
                    of Staff of the armed forces, General Surakut, and the Ambassador went to the
                    Prime Minister Thanom and made it clear that this would be a Thai responsibility
                    and that it was a grave and imminent danger and that we wanted to know what they
                    needed to do this properly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before the Ambassador made that approach I would assume
                        that in Washington this had probably gone to the President for final
                        approval that there would not be the regimental combat team?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STOKES: I would imagine that it went to the Secretary of Defense at least. And
                    that if I have no knowledge that the Joint Chiefs exercised their corporate
                    right to go directly to the President over the Secretary of Defense's head. But
                    remember, in all of this the Air Force chief of staff would be unwilling to
                    override the Ambassador.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Ambassador couldn't have taken that position without
                        Washington approval?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>STOKES: That's right, and remember the CIA was very much opposed, and USIA and
                    USAID, to involvement of the US military there. So you had a shifting coalition
                    behind positions but it was successfully orchestrated by the State Department.
                    On the other hand there was great danger in this because if a Viet Cong raid had
                    succeeded in a crippling attack on one of the bases like their successful
                    crippling attacks on the US bases in Vietnam they would have been murdered over
                    this and hell to pay. So we really worked tooth and nail day and night and
                    everything else to get the Thai the radio and signal equipment that they felt
                    was necessary to do this and to make sure that the Thai were doing an effective
                    job because the key idea was intelligence. That's what we wanted to know, if we
                    knew when the attack was coming and we were ready for it inside the wire. To
                    give you an idea of the degree of control, I had a red telephone by my bedside
                    and no US armed personnel could do anything outside the wire of the base without
                    approval over this phone. So there were very trenchant and stringent rules to
                    follow and the phone would ring often during the night with reports of this
                    threat or that threat or something else, it was like a combat control
                    center.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have a coterie of officers with you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STOKES: Yes, military, CIA, USAID, USIA, and other foreign service officers, many
                    who have gone on to be key people including Kelly. So to come back to this
                    crucial point, though, the Thai police notified Thai villagers that they were
                    apprehensive about Vietnamese coming across the river and urged them to inform
                    the police if they had any idea about this or saw anything. And in the old days,
                    the old ways the Thai police behaved, they would never have been told anything
                    by the peasants. But as the result of the years of effort to try to clean up the
                    Thai police operation and to create a rapport with the people there was some
                    hope that this would be done. And one day a Thai village head man called the
                    Thai police on one of the radios that we had provided to village head men and
                    said, “my villagers have seen a group of 60 people heavily armed and speaking
                    Vietnamese and going on the road in such-n-such direction toward one of the
                    bases.” The Thai informed us immediately, the base was put on red alert, and
                    that night at 2:00 am one of the sensors in the outer perimeter was tripped and
                    with night vision an American MP saw someone cutting the wire and fired a rocket
                    propelled grenade because they were authorized, once there was immediate
                    intrusion, and we had authorized the red alert, which gave them the right to
                    shoot. As luck would have it, the first rocket propelled grenade fired by the MP
                    hit in the chest the lead Vietnamese who was carrying what must have been about
                    100 pounds of plastic explosives and there was the most horrendous explosion
                    which wiped out the Viet Cong invaders.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Really, en masse, the whole group?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>STOKES: Well, maybe not in that one shot, but then once that went up, then
                    everything opened up from within the base. This was the first of eight Viet Cong
                    efforts to attack various US air bases.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So the Thai really did not succeed in blocking that
                        particular infiltration.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STOKES: No, but you see the distances are so short you could hardly expect it.
                    And that really wasn't what we were seeking so much. We didn't want massive Thai
                    shield. And this leads to all kinds of other issues about what was happening in
                    Laos and where was the Thai Army and what was a Thai Army and what was a Lao, or
                    things like this, also, but the point was here is that there were 8 major Viet
                    Cong attacks in force on US airbases including the B52 base at U Tapao. And in
                    the entire war not a single American was injured not a single combat aircraft
                    was put out of operation and this is an astounding record and a wonderful
                    vindication of the policy. There were many other vindications of the policy and
                    just last January before this I was in Thailand and I had dinner at the home of
                    the man who had been supreme commander of the Thai Armed forces and who was the
                    general that I was advising in this insurgency suppression headquarters at the
                    years we're talking about and we reviewed what had happened and it was just a
                    litany of successes of this indirect policy culminating in where Thailand is
                    today, by the way. So that you contrast this with the domino theory which was
                    erected to explain why we should fight in Vietnam because everything else would
                    just fall automatically if Vietnam fell. This was the rebuttal of it and the
                    rebuttal of it was due, I think, to this kind of far-seeing policy and its
                    rigorous implementation by Leonard Unger and Marshall Green and the support of
                    the Air Force. And it was the Air Force that stood to lose most by this of
                    course because it was Air Force assets that were at risk.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Bill, could you briefly cover the personal aspects of
                        performing this role? How did you, in day to day form, interact with the
                        Thai officials in pursuit of these policies?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STOKES: My official role was as advisor to the Thai ministry of the interior. The
                    Minister of the Interior of that time, General Praphas Charusathien , was in
                    fact the strong man of the regime and Vice Premier. The Premier was General
                    Thanom Kittikachorn but Praphas was the man who controlled the armed forces, the
                    police and the governors.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Armed forces, too?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>STOKES: Yes. He was also minister of defense, you know the real power there was
                    Praphas. And I had a very good relationship with Praphas and I was advisor to
                    him in his role as Minister of the Interior which included control of the police
                    and governors. The Thai invited me to attend meetings of the governors in the
                    outlying areas addressed to dealing with the insurgency. I frequented police
                    headquarters. If we had advice to give them about police organization or police
                    armament or tactics training I could freely go to the Thai at any level and
                    discuss it. The Thai were not at all closed to that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your office was in the embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STOKES: It was in the embassy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You would you go down and see this power, this person, or
                        would you typically, day to day, be going to see members of his staff on
                        particular problems. Praphas Charusathien his name is?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STOKES: Praphas Charusathien, the strong man of the regime.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm just asking a question of the simple procedures of
                        performing your role in this scene.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STOKES: The most regular and obvious role in relating to the Thai was with what
                    was called the Communist Suppression Operations Command under Lieutenant General
                    Sayud Kurdpong which was a Thai coordinating agency of the civil police and
                    military elements engaged in the counterinsurgency efforts or in supporting it.
                    He had an interagency staff like I had and he would have his meetings and we
                    would have our internal meetings. The way we were organized within the embassy
                    was that I had an interagency staff of people delegated from the US Army and Air
                    Force and CIA and USAID and USIA and foreign service officers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Full time with you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STOKES: Yes, and then we could draw upon the consulates for people in the field
                    as necessary.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You said that staff was about 40?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STOKES: Yes, and we had a big conference room with audiovisual systems and
                    everything and the whole wing of the embassy all dedicated to this purpose.</p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So they were physically together, you had a section of the
                        embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STOKES: Yes. And we developed the guidelines for the conduct with respect to the
                    insurgency by all American personnel. The central theme of it was don't just do
                    something, stand there. In other words, it absolutely forbade Americans, if they
                    saw or encountered some kind of emergency, from taking steps to deal with it.
                    They were to observe and see how the Thai dealt with it. If it was going wrong
                    then they would just later report and that would be a bad object lesson and we
                    would modify our advice to the Thai accordingly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were the Thai trying to involve Americans?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STOKES: I come to a key point on that in just a moment but I should finish your
                    earlier question. In addition to dealing with General Sayud which was like a
                    foreign ministry, a point of formal contact that might shield you or prevent you
                    from dealing with the rest of the Thai government. It didn't work that way, at
                    least in my experience, because I was invited by the Thai governors to attend
                    meetings that they held in the affected areas to consider their policy. I had
                    the ready access to the Thai police headquarters, and very often advice or
                    suggestions I was making that were not entirely easy to take but it was very
                    open. They recognized that we were well intentioned, that they were in charge,
                    that it was their responsibility. And so I give them a lot of credit, quite open
                    to what we had to say. I remember we often had outings together and just
                    friendly get togethers with key people in the Thai Ministry of the Interior
                    which is normally a very closed organization to outsiders in any country
                    including Thailand.</p>

                </p>
                <p>STOKES: For me, yes. We had many young people who spoke Thai but English is the
                    Thai's second language. I never encountered any problem of communication. I
                    tried to study Thai just for the cultural insights and so on, and even people
                    who spoke beautiful Thai like Al Francis never really used Thai in these general
                    meetings. They might personally, I'm sure it was valuable, I don't want to say
                    that it isn't. It was not a barrier.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>STOKES: Yes. A district officer or anything else. The Thai University has English
                    courses. Not everywhere. There was great antipathy between the Thai formal
                    military, that is the Thai Army which was the core of the strength of that
                    government and is still a dominant figure in Thai politics today. Thai Army is
                    an institution that has brought political significance to Thailand. It
                    represents the guarantor of the Thai people, vis-a-vis Chinese and other
                    influence. It's the core of the ethnic Thai strength in the country. But I would
                    frequently call directly on the Chief of Staff of the Army and have a regular
                    review with him of what was going on in the insurgency. And one day the Chief of
                    Staff of the Army hit me between the eyes, he said “Mr. Stokes, you know very
                    well that one of the key strongholds of the insurgency is among the mountain
                    tribes and it's on the key ridges of these high mountains that they have their
                    bases and your B-52s are flying back from Vietnam anyway, why couldn't they,
                    when they have extra bombs, just dump them on these mountain tops?” It took my
                    breath away because it is so contrary to all elements of our policy I wondered
                    why Surakut, who's a smart man, would have developed this. The military people
                    on the Joint Staff were really very loyal to the idea of what we were trying to
                    do and one of them told me that he had reliable evidence that the US commander
                    of Mac-Thai the Army general had put this idea in General Surakut mind and
                    Surakut had relayed it as a request to us. Although I didn't usually, the...</p>

                </p>
                <p>STOKES: No, after coming back. And after we had reported it I went immediately to
                    the Ambassador Leonard Unger with this information because it represented a case
                    of one of the lions coming off his stool and biting the hand of the trainer, and
                    it was to my mind one of the great moments in the foreign service to see Leonard
                    Unger, normally a mild man, respond not with shouting and pounding the table but
                    he picked up the telephone on his desk and got CINCPAC on the phone and insisted
                    on speaking to CINCPAC himself. He told him what had happened and said “I think
                    this is a direct insubordination to my role as Ambassador and I know that you
                    have instructed US commanders to the contrary and I feel I should inform you of
                    this and ask you to take immediate and urgent corrective action.” And CINCPAC
                    said “Ambassador, it's three hours flying time, in about three hours and fifteen
                    minutes let's meet again in your office on this subject and we'll get to the
                    bottom of it.” And within a day or two, in the time prescribed, in the
                    Ambassador's outer office were some ten white uniformed Navy admirals averaging
                    three, four staff, and General McGowan was called over and I have never seen
                    such a.... Meanwhile CINCPAC must have satisfied himself that this was a true
                    report. If it had not been, Bill Stokes would have been peering out from behind
                    bars I imagine by now. But CINCPAC put his nose about one quarter of an inch
                    away from General McGowan's nose and gave him the most excruciating going over
                    you'd ever want to see and McGowan disappeared from the scene.</p>

                <p>STOKES: Yes. To an undisclosed reassignment. And his deputy was made Acting
                    Commander and I remember not long thereafter Mac-Thai gave me an award of a
                    Mac-Thai flag on one side and “great job” on the other. It had a brass plate
                    with my name on it so it was kind of peacemaking and I think the great majority
                    of people in the Mac-Thai headquarters believed in the concept by that time
                    because it was working. But it was a constant effort to keep the discipline. It
                    was not merely the Army. The day after I left Thailand finally on reassignment I
                    read in the New York Times the most unbelievable story. The head of the CIA
                    station in Mekong Phnom had faked a letter purportedly from the Chinese
                    communist party to the head of the insurgency. I forget exactly the gist of it
                    but it was a provocative letter designed to promote a direct Thai involvement
                    against the insurgency on the military side. Heavy use of the military, or
                    greater Thai direct involvement in this, and the person I had been advising had
                    discovered that it was a fraud and had publicly...</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mean the Thai?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STOKES: Yes, the Thai and had publicly denounced it. This was on the CIA side, a
                    complete violation of the rules as well. But by and large except for these
                    egregious examples, the rules were consistently followed, and of course they
                    were never really broken because both of these were nipped in the bud - one by
                    the Thai and one by us. But there was a case of collusion by a US military
                    officer to sow ideas among the Thai that were contrary to the ideas we were
                    trying to sow. But by the way in which it was handled, the role of the
                    Ambassador as the true leader in the foreign service as the accepted field
                    leader of a policy that was essentially peace preserving and classical
                    diplomacy, so to speak, in the best sense, although in an operational context
                    was executed with the loyal participation of the whole American establishment. I
                    was in Thailand for six years in this work. It became awkward to think of a
                    substitution because then the whole question of who would be the
                    Counterinsurgency Coordinator, the military always felt that it should be a
                    general, the CIA had felt that they would naturally do it because they did it in
                    Vietnam, had had the credit. Peer DeSilva had been a CIA, top CIA, may had been
                    fifth or sixth in the whole CIA setup. But by the time I left six years
                    later...</p>

                </p>
                <p>STOKES: In 1973, in October, the insurgency was down to a whimper, it was clearly
                    not a significant threat.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you have any impression of where it stands at the
                        moment, does it continue in some way?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>STOKES: Yes, I mentioned that in January of 1991 I returned to Thailand and had a
                    dinner with General Sayud who later had become supreme commander and so on. And
                    on that day, the very last Thai insurgent had surrendered and was returned to
                    China. The Thai commander along the Malay border lasted five or six years longer
                    as an insurgency than in the parts of the country that I had been mainly
                    concerned about. That is the north and northeastern parts. I don't want to say
                    by what time it had entirely disappeared but under Deng Xiaoping by 1979 China
                    had withdrawn all support of this insurgency and had sought good relations with
                    the Thai government and the Thai reciprocated. So the Maoist-inspired insurgency
                    in the north and northeast had evaporated by that time. It took another 10 years
                    in the south because it was involved there with Malay irredentism and a lot of
                    local matters that had nothing to do with what we're talking about.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Or had an indigenous substance of it's own in the south,
                        you're saying?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STOKES: Yes, that's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So I gather in the north it did not, it was mostly pump
                        priming from China?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STOKES: Yes and this whole Thai effort to deal with the insurgency in a positive
                    way was focused in the north and northeast. The Thai attitude in the south to
                    these essentially Malay provinces...by the way, in the north and northeast the
                    Thai emphasized that this is your country, you are Thai and we are Thai and the
                    insurgents are Chinese. In the Malay provinces, the Thai had no ethnic appeal to
                    the populace at all. They were just really Malay provinces, in their manner of
                    speaking and everything else. The Thai didn't have the attitude of wanting to
                    win over those people either. They were just outside our perspective and I think
                    are another question altogether. This I think is one of the great success
                    stories of what I might call the making of unhistory. The anticipation of a
                    threatened disaster, the painstaking development of policies to forestall that
                    disaster, and their success in such a way that nothing happens. That is recorded
                    in history which usually pays attention to disastrous wars and the killings of
                    vast numbers of people, great ebbs and flows of power. But if you build up the
                    strength and forestall and nip in the bud efforts by a great power to foster
                    surrogate insurrection in a smaller neighboring state and finally cause that
                    great power to withdraw from the effort, then unhistory fills the interim. So
                    the history will talk a great deal I'm sure about the Vietnam War and the covert
                    war in Laos that was related to it, Cambodia, but very little about the Thai
                    wing of what could have been more dangerous because it involved a great power,
                    namely China instead of just a local strong second rate power like Vietnam with
                    no real capability of going very far with anything that it succeeded in
                    exploiting.</p>

                <p>STOKES: Yes, I thought of very interesting things since we've included some
                    foreign service lore or concepts that might effect the way the foreign service
                    organizes itself. I'd like to say a few things about that.</p>

                        of your impression of the situation in Cambodia vis a vis Chinese policy
                        right now. I know you're not currently expert in it but is it your feeling
                        that the Chinese are still pursuing Mao's old continental policy in Cambodia
                        with the Pathet Lao?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STOKES: Well not with the Pathet Lao, with the Khmer Rouge.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Khmer Rouge, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STOKES: Well, China has historically, long before the communists, under the
                    various empires and continuing on, has felt that it should have a direct and
                    important role and influence in all the countries that were part of its sphere
                    of influence, and Cambodia would be one of them - although far from the most
                    important. The reason it comes to the forefront right now is of course that
                    Cambodia is weak and divided and this is in a way kind of left over from an
                    earlier period. When Norodom Sihanouk was king of Cambodia, he and the Thai had
                    endless battles along their frontier. The Thai frontier with Cambodia consists
                    of provinces in which the population is largely Khmer so the Thai organized its
                    own insurrection called the Khmer Rhouge or Free Khmer that did bring an
                    insurgency along the boundaries against Cambodia when Sihanouk was there. When
                    Sihanouk fled to China and lived in China for many years after he was overthrown
                    by Lon Nol it was at that time that the Chinese took up an interest in his cause
                    and began developing a policy of direct involvement in Cambodia through Sihanouk
                    on one hand and Phrapas on the other. It's a question of what works. In other
                    words, I think they would have pursued support of the insurgency in Thailand if
                    it had been successful, but it wasn't. In the case of Cambodia they still had
                    instruments to play, and they're still playing them. But they're playing it in a
                    nuanced way. They're trying to balance water on both shoulders, they don't want
                    to give up their hand in the game and on the other hand they don't want to make
                    themselves pariahs in Accion - nor have it envenom their relationships with the
                    rest of the western world so I expect that they would be reasonable within a
                    degree but not give up support for elements that have been dependent on
                    them.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And do you think Praphas is really quite dependent on the

                </p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>STOKES: Yes, I think I don't know enough to say anything very profound on this
                    subject, but he's gotten his arms from the Chinese and he clearly seemed to be
                    someone who is, it may be a little embarrassing to some of the, probably was
                    embarrassing to the government in China of Zhao Ziyang who was focusing on the
                    internationalist point of view. Now you have a continental crowd back in charge
                    in China again, and the continental crowd would be more open to Praphas. Zhao
                    Ziyang would have sold him down the river by now. Again you see that ebb and
                    flow of the Chinese communist leadership between internationalists and the
                    continentalists and Zhao Ziyang looked with his enormous success in promoting
                    agrarian privatization in China and an astounding ability of China to go from
                    being an important importer of US wheat to being self-sufficient in food by Zhao
                    Ziyang's policy of giving the peasant the use of fruit of his own land, even
                    tenure over it, if not amounting to ownership. And then Zhao Ziyang wanted to
                    apply the same purposes to industry. And this, of course, brings me to my next
                    involvement in China that doesn't directly involve the foreign service, but it
                    was certainly a wonderful perspective on what is happening in a country, that I
                    was regional manager for AT Karney of our industrial modernization work in
                    China. I visited some 220 Chinese industrial establishments ranging from
                    incredibly vast first auto works in Chong Chun with a work force of 475,000 as
                    you can imagine to small factories in the countryside. And each day, 2 or 3 or 4
                    days with the factory staff and leadership talking about the problems of their
                    factory and their relationship with the authorities and transportation and what
                    life was like. So there all holes are no longer barred, you're not seen as an
                    outsider, you're one of the family and I think there's a dimension there of
                    diplomacy that really ought to be explored.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mean people to people?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STOKES: Yes, for example, the armed forces have what they call fast students,
                    those that go to study a language, foreign area specialist training, they spend
                    time doing things like this. But I wouldn't copy that, it's just that it
                    suggests the idea that a foreign service career ought not to be entirely one of
                    issuing visas, doing economic reports, and so on. You should have periods in
                    which you are really exposed to the life of the country on a full time basis in
                    some kind of constructive role.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You ought to have lunch with Brandon Grove and chat about
                        these things. He's the head of FSI now.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>STOKES: Yes, there are many ideas about that. I feel very strongly that the
                    tremendous events that have occurred in the past few years should lead to a
                    reorganization of our concept of what the foreign service should be doing and
                    what kind of people we need in it and how they should be trained and what they
                    should be doing. It should be a radical kind of zero based budgeting concept and
                    yet when ideas calling for change are raised in the foreign service day lunch by
                    Bob....his name escapes me, the former Inspector General. The response by the
                    Director General in the department...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Bob Sayer?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STOKES: Yes, Bob Sayer, was sort of embarrassed as though he had farted on the
                    stage or something. It's discouraging. We really need to be thinking this
                    through because the armed forces are going to change. The whole needs of America
                    are going to change. We have to change in the foreign service. My career was one
                    in which every place I was I had an irregular type of assignment. It was a
                    wonderful kind of assignment, and all of that, every one of them, but it
                    involved contacts with parts of foreign governments that never paid any
                    attention to the foreign ministry. Foreign ministries almost always, and
                    certainly in the countries I've been in, shield diplomats, and their job is to
                    keep diplomats away from messing around in the country, and so you're isolated.
                    Very isolated. The metaphor for it was once the Thai dedicated a new university
                    in northeast Thailand and the Ambassador couldn't go, the King had invited them,
                    so I went. To get up there, the Ambassador provided his plane and all the
                    diplomats were there and we were on this secret US air base in which all kinds
                    of crazy aircraft were flying missions. We were waiting for the change of planes
                    and these planes were coming in and you could see the Ambassador's eyes opening
                    wide and I knew from my work exactly what was going on and none of them had the
                    faintest clue about anything of this sort and neither would anybody in the
                    American embassy on the foreign service side have known anything about it. But
                    that was the major reality of what was going on in that part of the world at
                    that time. The foreign service should not be excluded from it, we should not be
                    creatures only of the foreign ministry of the countries that we're assigned to,
                    and we should not be shunted aside like the Department of State is often shunted
                    aside even within the US government. And we need to work toward building up our
                    role in this way to the kind of role that we had in Thailand, in China, in other
                    places where the foreign service was at the heart and soul of what was going
                    on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think the problem is that that kind of assignment as you
                        were saying between tapes is not typically terribly useful for advancement
                        in the old-fashioned career sense. It may lead to promotion okay but as far
                        as moving up the ladder in functional terms, it doesn't seem to me it
                        typically helps.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>STOKES: No, it doesn't help and people will never be trained for roles like this
                    if those who have the power are not interested in those roles. If they want to
                    reward people who know how to take a paper out of the in-box and scribble on it
                    and put it in the out box and get through all of that in the course of the day,
                    then that's what going to be rewarded. And we'll just never have the other role
                    because we won't want it effectively. If we want it effectively, we will promote
                    people who are able to seize those roles and run with them. Now, where, for
                    example, does a person who is the President's Chief Advisor on International
                    Affairs, his National Security Advisor, where does he turn for members of his
                    staff? Marine Corps lieutenant colonels? Navy admirals? Why not? If you have an
                    activist concept of what constitutes real achievement and you don't turn to the
                    foreign service, if the foreign service has eschewed that role and despises it
                    and won't encourage anyone to do it. That's what Bob Sayer wasn't very explicit
                    about in that speech but that's I think one of the elements of what he had in
                    mind and Bob Sayer knows what operational involvement is because he was with
                    CINCSOUTH in Panama and has been through all this, we've often discussed it he
                    and I.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Are there any other fields of your foreign service
                        experience that you want to touch on?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>STOKES: Well, in relationship to China when I came back from having been under
                    incommunicado arrest in China the Department said, “Well, what would you like in
                    the world as an assignment that would give you, within reason, anything you
                    want.” This was bewildering to me and I remember getting a call from Alex
                    Johnson who was then Director of Northeast Asian Affairs and he said, “Bill,
                    we'd like you to go to Tokyo and do a peripheral report on China, reporting on
                    China in the embassy, and I had two wonderful years in Tokyo in which that was
                    part of the assignment. And the Zaibatsu never forgot their interest in China
                    and their roots there, interestingly enough the head of MITI had been in
                    Manchuria when I was there and he had been President of Manchu heavy industries
                    and we befriended him in the consulate and we helped arrange the evacuation of
                    terribly mistreated Japanese civilians to Japan and his name was Tagisake. And
                    when we came out of China he arranged a reception for us in Japan and so my
                    whole assignment in Japan I had free access to the Zaibatsu through Tagisake. It
                    was also the time of the negotiations for the peace treaty. John Foster Dulles
                    came out and I was assigned to assist him in various ways, there were many
                    others, Bill Sullivan was there, we had neighboring homes. I remember one day
                    hearing from Bill of the replacement by Truman of General MacArthur. MacArthur,
                    of course, was unapproachable, nobody ever got near him and, however, I had a
                    chance to meet him. We were coming out of China having been expelled, and all
                    the world was noticing this and there were headlines in all of the papers. We
                    landed in Yokohama, I mentioned that Tagisake greeted us, we were driven in his
                    limousines up to Tokyo. We were invited by General MacArthur for lunch. We were
                    on our way back to the United States, Mr. Ward and myself. We came, General
                    MacArthur was late and when he came in, we all sat down to lunch and we thought
                    the purpose was that the Consul General had briefed General MacArthur about all
                    the events in Manchuria and what it actually was that General MacArthur gave a
                    long account, it must have been 25 minutes long, of what was happening in China
                    to Mr. Ward. At the end of which he turned to Ward and said, do you agree, Mr.
                    Consul General? And I'll give Ward a lot of credit, “Not really, General, not
                    really.” And you could hear a pin drop. I thought the generals were not even
                    breathing then. And after what seemed like an interminable silence MacArthur
                    stood up and said, “Well, back to work.” and turned and walked through a
                    door.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Closed mind.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STOKES: So, I contrast that with one day when I had been in Tokyo about 18 months
                    and MacArthur had been removed and General Ridgway was the new Supreme
                    Commander, the phone rang, it was Bill Sebald who was the Chief of Mission.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: My Ambassador in Canberra.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>STOKES: And he never spoke to me, I mean I'd been to his home and all of that,
                    but the idea that he would call me on the phone, the political section, was very
                    unusual. He said, “Bill, there is an officer from General Ridgway's staff here
                    and General Ridgway wants to see you” and I naturally went with the man, I think
                    he was a colonel of some sort and I went in his staff car over to the Daiyichi
                    building, went through all these corridors and finally came to this door and the
                    colonel said go in. I opened it, it was General Ridgway alone at a desk. “Oh,
                    you Stokes? Come on in. I want to talk to you.” I sat down, he said, “Look, you
                    were in Manchuria, right, for four years?” I said “Yes.” He said, “Well, you
                    know there's a lot of people who say (the Korean war was in full tilt at this
                    time) that we should bomb the Chinese side of the boarder, especially the
                    railway to interdict the supply of the Chinese armies.” (Every Chinese had
                    nearly at the gates of Seoul at this time) He said, “What do you think about it,
                    what is your experience say, to this question?” I said, “Well, General, during
                    the fighting in Manchuria, as we both recall, the national government armies,
                    American trained and equipped had removed by rail with the US Marines as their
                    guards, and supplies transported by rail supported the National armies. They
                    were beaten by armies that had operated for 15 years without access to any rail
                    lines of any kind at all. And never in my experience did I see any significant
                    tactical resupply of the communist armies by rail. And I've also seen the rail
                    lines lie devastated for nearly 10 years. When we were leaving Mukden they had
                    barely restored the main rail lines up from mainland China. I doubt that
                    communist commanders ever paid much attention to railroads or are deeply reliant
                    on them. I said, if they are they certainly feel perfectly comfortable with
                    alternative means of supply, and I think if the railroads magically could be
                    erased tonight it wouldn't probably affect, from what I can tell as a lay
                    person, that the Army's performance on the ground much at all for any length of
                    time.” “Okay, that's what I wanted to hear, thanks Bill.” He got up, shook my
                    hand, walked with me to the door. I thought, this is quite a guy, Ridgway. I did
                    as it turned out have something, I'd done a report on the Chinese railroads in
                    Manchuria and that was probably as good information as you could get. After
                    Japan and the negotiation of the peace treaty I was assigned to in a routine way
                    to Rabat, Morocco. And by this time, I wanted to stay in East Asia and
                    Ambassador Robert Murphy had written several nice things about dispatches I'd
                    written so I was bold enough to go and ask him if he would keep me on in East
                    Asia. And he said “I'd be willing to do that Bill,” but he said, “You know, I
                    have some experience in North Africa myself, he said, I think you would find
                    this absolutely fascinating” and he said “I'll make a bargain with you, you go
                    to Rabat as the Department wants, and if, in a year, it isn't what I've said it
                    is, write me and I'll ask for you to come back.” So with that I went off to
                    North Africa and I certainly never regretted it. The day I arrived there was a
                    strike in the local rug factory which was the beginning of the revolution
                    against the French by the Moroccans.</p>
