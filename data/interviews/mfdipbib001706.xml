                <p>The Harvard Year and World War II</p>
                <p>Back to Academia</p>
                <p>Our Nieman Fellowship year was a magnificent experience. I was swept up in the
                    lively intellectual life of a great university at exactly the right time in my
                    career, and benefited from it enormously. In 1938 I was 30 years old and had
                    been struggling for several years with various forms of journalism and
                    free-lance writing. It was not easy to get ahead in the daily grind of newspaper
                    work in Minneapolis, Richmond, and Baltimore, and the freedom and stimulation of
                    Harvard enchanted me. Counting the hours I spent in classrooms, in socializing
                    with members of the faculty, in browsing through a long reading list in the
                    stacks of Widener Library, and in evening reading at home, I must have averaged
                    at least twelve hours a day in some form of educational activity. It was exactly
                    what I wanted most to do, and I was entirely, gloriously happy.</p>
                <p>Our arrival at Harvard began in most dramatic fashion, for we arrived only hours
                    ahead of the great New England hurricane of September 20, 1938. This horrendous
                    storm, which caused tidal waves all along the coasts of Long Island,
                    Connecticut, Rhode Island, and Massachusetts, took a heavy toll of human lives,
                    not to mention the devastation of property and disruption of power lines and
                    communications. Ruth and I had driven up from Baltimore by easy stages, pelted
                    all the way by heavy rains. She was pregnant with our first child, a great event
                    in our lives after years of waiting, and we were determined to drive slowly,
                    with several overnight stops. The last of these was with my Hepburn relatives on
                    the Connecticut shore. The day of the storm, we got away for Cambridge in
                    mid-morning, and were horrified to learn later that the Hepburn frame cottage
                    was swept away by waves that afternoon and deposited half a mile inland.</p>
                <p>Our route took us through New London, Westerly, and Providence, all of which were
                    hard hit by the hurricane a few hours after we passed through. Hundreds of
                    people were drowned by waves which piled up in the rocky areas where the water
                    was pushed up into funnel-shaped inlets, forming high waves that swept away
                    people and property. We were aware of black clouds scudding overhead, but were
                    safe in a large brick hotel in Cambridge when the storm reached us. It was not
                    until next day that we learned of the magnitude of the disaster. It was a close
                    squeak for us.</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>Picking our way through the fallen trees and power lines of Cambridge for the
                    next several days, we checked in with Harvard authorities and became acquainted
                    with our Nieman colleagues and with the man who was to supervise our program.
                    This was the distinguished Pulitzer-Prize-winning poet, Archibald MacLeish.
                    Archie was not only a poet but a journalist, well-acquainted with top figures in
                    both literature and publishing. He had been working for several years on the
                    staff of Fortune for a salary which dazzled me, for it was about six times what
                    I was paid in Baltimore. The theory was that someone like Archie was needed to
                    shepherd our group through the academic year and interpret Harvard to
                    newspapermen — and vice versa. I liked the personable MacLeish, as we all did,
                    but was inclined to resent the notion that after William and Mary, Columbia, and
                    some part-time courses at Johns Hopkins I would need guidance at Harvard.</p>
                <p>The Nieman Fellows that first year were a diverse group. The oldest was Louis M.
                    Lyons, 40, a thoughtful and scholarly reporter for the Boston Globe. He was
                    eventually to take over direction of the Nieman program. Next oldest was Irving
                    Dilliard, 36, of the St. Louis Post Dispatch, an editorial writer who had
                    written many scholarly articles on the Supreme Court and its decisions. Then
                    there was Edwin A. Lahey of the Chicago Daily News, also 36, who had had little
                    formal education, never having attended college. He was a nationally known
                    writer on labor affairs. Perhaps in his case a guide like our friendly MacLeish
                    was needed. Other Nieman Fellows included two editorial writers from Alabama; a
                    young Kentuckian whose family owned the local paper in Paducah; a young science
                    writer from the Boston Herald and an editorial writer from the Washington Post,
                    a Dartmouth graduate who was interested in Latin American affairs.</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>In looking over courses listed in the university catalogue, I conscientiously
                    focused on offerings in government and economics which seemed relevant to my
                    study project. But I was also tempted by the possibilities in history, simply to
                    indulge my personal interest in following up the courses I had taken at Johns
                    Hopkins on the Roman Empire, a period which has always fascinated me. So I
                    settled on a history of the Byzantine Empire, taught by Robert Blake, which I
                    found most rewarding. Covering the period from the founding of Constantinople in
                    330 A.D. to its capture by the Turks in 1453, Blake's lectures convinced me that
                    the Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire was not a long period of decadence, as it
                    had been pictured by Edward Gibbon in his celebrated Decline and Fall, but a
                    separate historical development which had reached high levels of accomplishment.
                    Lasting for more than 1,100 years, it had blocked the expansion of Islam into
                    Europe for several critical centuries, meanwhile exercising a civilizing
                    influence on Russia and the Balkan countries. What particularly interested me
                    about this history was that it followed quite a different pattern from the one
                    emphasized by Oswald Spengler, the scholarly German author of The Decline of the
                    West. Spengler thought that each civilization followed a biological type of
                    progression, from youth through maturity to old age and decadence. But the
                    Byzantine pattern was a series of peaks and valleys. In some periods the empire
                    was in a declining phase, but then new forces would appear which would
                    regenerate it and spur it on to new achievements. I found this different model
                    fascinating and suggestive. It was encouraging to think that decadent trends in
                    our own civilization might be overcome by forces of regeneration and
                    recovery.</p>
                <p>Naturally my Nieman comrades considered me a bit eccentric for my devotion to the
                    Byzantines, and I had to undergo some good-natured ribbing. What did this
                    history have to do with my work for the Baltimore Sun?, they would ask. I would
                    respond that I was not delving back into antiquity solely for personal interest,
                    but was trying to obtain some perspective on our own times and how Western man
                    might improve his chances of building a better future.</p>
                <p>As the year wore on I sampled many courses, learning something from each. But I
                    found the most profitable use of my time to be reading books relevant to my
                    study project on the government's role in the economic system. The record I kept
                    showed that by the end the year I had perused some 150 volumes. In the second
                    semester I explored two fields still new to me, sociology and cultural
                    anthropology. What I was trying to get at was a better understanding of human
                    motivation and social causation, of the reactions of populations to the march of
                    circumstances such as economic depression and prolonged unemployment. Much of
                    what I learned came from books and from personal contacts with three gifted
                    Harvard professors, Talcott Parsons and Robert K. Merton in sociology and Clyde
                    Kluckhohn in anthropology. Parsons and Kluckhohn especially were to remain close
                    personal friends for as long as they lived, and my gratitude to both is
                    unending.</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>Meanwhile, my wife and I and the other Nieman Fellows and their wives were
                    hospitably entertained by many members of the Harvard faculty. My old friend
                    Payson Wild whom I had known in Paris in 1928 and his wife Marian were
                    particularly cordial, and we made congenial new friends on every side. A major
                    contribution to the intellectual activities of the Nieman group was made by our
                    “curator” (his curious Harvard title), Archibald MacLeish. Endeavoring both to
                    promote contacts with Harvard scholars and with leading figures in the world of
                    journalism, Archie arranged a series of weekly dinners at which leading American
                    publishers and editors talked on issues of the day. The guests included, for
                    example, Henry R. Luce, Walter Lippmann, John Gunther, Charles A. Merz, and
                    Heywood Broun. From the Harvard faculty we had a representative selection of
                    professors, the most frequent participant being Felix Frankfurter of the Harvard
                    Law School.</p>
                <p>Frankfurter was a friend of MacLeish and seemed to feel that it was essential to
                    his personal objectives to make members of our group his devoted disciples. A
                    very emotional man, he was especially keyed up in 1938-39 by Nazi persecutions
                    in Germany and by the imminent war in Europe. I am afraid that I was among the
                    Fellows who most objected to his dominating attitude. I did not necessarily
                    disagree with his views, many of which I approved, but I strongly resented his
                    constant assumption that we had no right to views of our own. It was our duty,
                    he insisted, to help promote the courses of action in which he believed. I very
                    much wished he would leave us alone and trust us to work at our own courses of
                    action.</p>
                <p>The Nieman dinners were often interesting, and helped us better to understand
                    conflicts in American life over the Roosevelt administration and the gathering
                    storm in Europe. They had another effect on me, however, which was to sharpen my
                    feeling that I was out of place in the newspaper business. I had never really
                    intended to commit myself to daily journalism as a profession, for it seemed to
                    me that most of what people like myself wrote for newspapers was ephemeral and
                    of no enduring importance. I was passionately devoted to my studies at Harvard,
                    and as the year drew to a close I had less and less enthusiasm for returning to
                    Baltimore.</p>
                <p>Nevertheless, I thought the Nieman program was a splendid one, very important to
                    American journalism. It has been so successful over the years since my time that
                    it has become established as the finest educational experience for professionals
                    in the news media which exists anywhere in the world. Among the several hundred
                    journalists who have benefited from it have been people of both sexes, many
                    ethnic backgrounds, every sort of communications media, and (although not
                    financed from the original Nieman funds) many foreign nationalities. My own
                    Nieman year was the greatest single intellectual experience of my life, and was
                    a turning point in my career which opened many subsequent opportunities for
                    advancement. As Ruth and I drove back to Baltimore in June, happily bringing our
                    newborn son, we felt eternally grateful to Harvard and the Nieman program.</p>
                <p>The Impact of World War II</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>Although the United States did not become a belligerent in World War II until two
                    and a half years after my Harvard year ended, we were conscious of the gathering
                    conflict from 1938 on. When the Nazis invaded Poland in 1939 a period began
                    which was to dominate the lives of my generation for the next six years. It was
                    the greatest war in which our country has ever been engaged, by a very long way,
                    and in fact the greatest martial conflict in the history of the world. British
                    writers used to refer to World War I as “the Great War,” but this one was even
                    greater. As for the American people, we were only briefly involved in World War
                    I, for the outpouring of American military power and supplies into Europe tipped
                    the balance in 1918 before most of our troops saw any actual fighting. But World
                    War II involved the United States in such an all-out effort as had not been seen
                    in the Western Hemisphere since Civil War days. It was not as bloody for
                    Americans as the Civil War, especially in the South, but of far greater world
                    importance.</p>
                <p>My role in World War II was to spend four years in a Baltimore shipyard, the
                    Maryland Drydock Company, as the organizer and director of a large educational
                    program in which training in engineering and mechanical skills was given to an
                    estimated 15,000 men and women who worked as shipfitters, electricians, sheet
                    metal workers, pipefitters, machinists, welders, and in many other crafts. This
                    was such an improbable development that I had better back up and explain how it
                    happened.</p>
                <p>For two years after returning from Harvard in June, 1939, I continued in the
                    employ of the Sun papers, working part of the time as an editorial writer but
                    most of the time as a reporter on the local news staff, doing pretty much the
                    same kind of work I had done before my fellowship year. I would have welcomed an
                    opportunity to become a Washington or foreign correspondent, but there was a lot
                    of nepotism in the Sun paper organization and the positions which appealed to me
                    always seemed to me to go to someone else. These two years were an unhappy and
                    frustrating period, for I was making very little use of the Nieman experience.
                    Friends at Harvard were sympathetic, and I was offered a graduate fellowship in
                    sociology which might have led into an academic career. There were personal
                    reasons why I could not accept in 1940, and by the next spring, that of 1941, it
                    seemed inevitable that the United States would soon be drawn into the European
                    war.</p>
                <p>Feeling that I could not be a university student at a time when my country was
                    about to enter a great global struggle, I went to a friend in industrial
                    relations work and asked whether Baltimore defense plants could make use of
                    persons with my qualifications. The answer was strongly affirmative. It led to
                    my accepting a position in industrial relations at Maryland Drydock, a ship
                    repair company which operated drydocks and outfitting piers on the south side of
                    Baltimore harbor. I began work there in early July, five months before the
                    Japanese attack at Pearl Harbor. Thus began one of the most challenging and
                    fulfilling periods of my life, extremely valuable to my subsequent career.</p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>The Maryland Drydock Company had employed only about 1,000 workers in peacetime,
                    and during the depression years often had only from two to four ships to work on
                    at any one time. In 1941, however, it was expanding rapidly. The United States
                    was giving aid to the British Ministry of Shipping under the Lease-Lend Program
                    of President Roosevelt, which meant that many British ships were coming in for
                    repairs. It was also moving as speedily as possible to bring into service
                    laid-up American ships left over from World War I in order to make them
                    available for hauling the steady stream of supplies and munitions being sent
                    overseas to the Allies. This reconditioning and modernization program required
                    additional shipyard manpower, and by the time I arrived on the scene our company
                    had expanded to 3,500 employees. At the peak of the war effort in 1944-45 the
                    total number reached 10,500.</p>
                <p>At first my duties were in the general personnel and labor relations field, in
                    which I already had some background. But very soon a new responsibility was
                    thrust upon me. Our shipyard was able to employ plenty of inexperienced workers,
                    but was very short of trained mechanics. The shortage was particularly acute in
                    certain skills needed only in shipyards, the most important of which were those
                    of the Mold Loft and Shipfitting Department. Shipbuilding work had been in the
                    doldrums all during the inter-war years, and there were very few experienced
                    shipfitters to be found. It was necessary to organize a training program to
                    upgrade the skills of our new people and make them into productive workers.
                    Someone had to plan and operate such a program, and for reasons never made clear
                    I was chosen to be the one.</p>
                <p>It would be tedious to describe all the problems I had in developing a company
                    training program. I have never been able to do this in less than 5,000 words or
                    so, so will be unable to do so in the present chapter. So let me just give a few
                    examples. To eliminate our worst bottleneck, that in the Shipfitting Department,
                    I hit upon the idea, after consulting with several experienced people, of
                    operating after-hour classes in reading marine blueprints. These were conducted
                    for our learners after normal work hours, on overtime pay, on our own shipyard
                    premises. And soon we were in business with an expanding training program.</p>
                <p>Let me explain, as best I can, what a shipfitter does. Working from blueprints
                    prepared by naval architects — or in our repair yard, oftentimes from
                    measurements made on the actual ship — a shipfitter prepares on heavy material
                    known as template paper a kind of pattern known as a template. The markings from
                    this template are then transferred to steel plates and beams by means of a
                    hammer and punch. The next operation takes place in a fabricating shop, where
                    the marked steel is cut by machinery to the size and shape indicated by the
                    punch marks. Then the finished piece is transported out to the ship for which it
                    was intended, and there the shipfitter takes over again, fitting it into place
                    with the help of ironworkers, welders, and men with acetylene torches known as
                    burners, who can trim off any excess.</p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>So far, so good. But a ship is not a rectangular structure like a house, but has
                    all the curves of a fish. It has fore-and-aft curves known as sheer, for a
                    ship's hull somewhat resembles a lengthwise slice of watermelon, curving upward
                    at both ends. Then it has lateral curves that run from gunwale to gunwale; they
                    are convex, like the curve of a hog's back or a high-crowned roadway, and are
                    known as camber. Finally, it has vertical curves for its ribs, which start at
                    the keel and then curve upward to shape the ship's bottom and sides. But it is
                    not enough to allow for sheer, camber, and vertical curvature. Just as a fish
                    has a head and a tail, so a ship has a bow and stern. These are curved
                    structures, as we all know — the bow coming to a triangular point at the ship's
                    headstern, often with flaring reverse curves; the stern rounded like a receding
                    chin, dropping away from deck level down to the sternpost and propeller.</p>
                <p>Sound complicated? You can bet that it jolly well is. It's difficult enough to
                    build a new ship with all these curves, and have the parts fit together
                    properly. But imagine the work in a ship repair yard, when a ship cones into
                    drydock with its bow smashed from a collision, or a hole stove in its bottom
                    from running aground on a rocky reef. Or, as happened not infrequently, when a
                    war-damaged ship cones in, a great torpedo hole in its side. Then measurements
                    have to be taken, and new structures designed to replace the damaged parts. If
                    the design comes out of a hull drafting room, it reaches the Mold Loft as a
                    blueprint. The Mold Loftsman — the great master craftsman of ship's hull workers
                    — must lay the lines out full size on the loft floor, visualize the new
                    structure in three dimensions, nail together a three-dimensional mock-up of thin
                    wooden strips, and from that model make templates.</p>
                <p>This was all new stuff to me, and obviously far outside of any experiences I ever
                    had as a newspaperman. But I talked with the people who knew shipyard work,
                    enlisted their ideas, and worked with them cooperatively. We built up a training
                    staff, we experimented, we innovated, we let our solutions develop in a
                    practical way from our problems, and bit by bit we devised answers to our most
                    pressing concerns. We taught our young shipfitters to read blueprints in
                    classroom situations. Then instructors out in the yard showed learners how to
                    turn blueprints into fabricated steel parts. Much of the shipfitting work given
                    beginners was simple in nature — new ammunition racks, for example, or
                    strengthening the foundation of a ship's stern section in order to mount an
                    anti-submarine gun. And the interior compartmentation work, being relatively
                    rectangular, was fairly easy.</p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>I've used shipfitting as an illustrative example. In our training program we had
                    also to deal with a score of other crafts. Marine electrical work was one of our
                    big problems. Just as we taught shipfitters to read blueprints, so we had to
                    teach electrical learners enough theoretical knowledge of electricity so that
                    they could learn to make all the different kinds of electrical hook-ups,
                    including three-way and four-way switches. We had a specially equipped
                    laboratory which my staff devised, in which we had lighting fixtures and
                    switches mounted on wooden boards for practice. We also had steel bulkheads in
                    this room, and showed our learners how to use an electric drill to mount a
                    fixture on a steel background. After the United States entered the war, Maryland
                    Drydock was given more and more Navy outfitting contracts, and in consequence
                    our electrical work increased enormously.</p>
                <p>Since I cannot cover everything in this brief account, let me skip to the subject
                    of training women to became shipyard mechanics. Beginning in 1943 our local
                    Selective Service boards, pressed for more manpower for military duty, began
                    reclassifying and drafting a great many of our brightest young male learners,
                    the ones we had taught to read hull blueprints, to do electrical work, to
                    develop the geometrical shapes for sheet metal ventilating ducts, and so on. We
                    argued that we needed their skills in our defense work, but were told to hire
                    women instead. Our management feared that women could not learn our kind of
                    work, which varied from ship to ship and required the ability to figure out a
                    constant succession of new mechanical problems. The building yards could train
                    women because their work was repetitive in nature, constructing the sane
                    identical ship over and over. But our work required outstanding versatility as
                    well as manual skills.</p>
                <p>Anyway, the women were hired — hundreds and hundreds of them, and eventually
                    2,000 or more. I recruited for our training staff a woman psychologist I knew.
                    She was Margaret Gaskill, a Vassar graduate, and she was out on the ships with
                    the women workers, dressed as they were in blue cover-alls, figuring out answers
                    to their problems. By this time we had worked out effective training patterns
                    for male workers, so we had a fairly good idea what to do. We put the women into
                    crafts not requiring great muscular strength. We used them as electric welders,
                    as shipfitter helpers, as sheet metal workers, and especially, and in very large
                    numbers, as electricians. In addition to our classroom training in electrical
                    work, we organized our women electrical learners into on-the-job school gangs.
                    In addition to a male instructor, we had three competent male mechanics in each
                    such group, all four helping to train nine women. The women would start out as
                    helpers to the men. There would come a day when a woman worker would be told to
                    bring in her own toolbox and to work independently, with another woman learner
                    helping her. This pattern, arrived at after some experimentation, worked
                    effectively. There came a time, the last winter of the war, when a whole fleet
                    of naval auxiliary vessels being outfitted for the Pacific war had all their
                    electrical lighting installed by our female school gangs on the night shift. It
                    was so cold on those unheated ships that winter that our girls wore up to eight
                    layers of clothing. But their morale was high, and they got the job done.</p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>In shipfitting and in sheet metal work we also had good success with women
                    mechanics. In shipfitting our school gangs for women specialized on ammunition
                    racks, gun mounts, and other jobs which were pretty much the same from ship to
                    ship. But they also took on some large and complicated assignments. I happened
                    one day to observe a huge gantry crane lowering a new pilot house on the deck of
                    a Liberty ship being converted to a Navy supply ship. On the deck stood one of
                    our shipfitter girls, little Jonnie Martin from Alabama, blueprint in hand,
                    directing the operation while a gang of brawny riggers followed her commands.
                    Again and again, Jonnie had the crane lift the house and try again, the riggers
                    with their chains and winches pulling it into position. Finally she was
                    satisfied, the riggers loosened their equipment, and the welders stepped forward
                    to fasten the structure to the ship. What struck me about the whole scene was
                    the unquestioning way the men accepted the authority of this little slip of a
                    girl. They were muscular men and knew their jobs, but she was the boss because
                    she knew what the blueprint called for.</p>
                <p>There came a time in the spring of 1945 when I could see that my work at Maryland
                    Drydock was coming to an end. The war was nearly over. The Germans were being
                    driven back on two fronts; the island-hopping in the Pacific was moving our
                    amphibious forces closer and closer to Japan's bare islands. I began writing
                    letters, making new contacts, and being interviewed for postwar positions. As I
                    shall tell in the next chapter, I found what I was looking for in Washington,
                    and accepted a position with the Department of State. After spending part of
                    each week on liberal leave from the shipyard while I used the time to learn
                    about the U. S. Foreign Service, there came a day in late July which I devoted
                    to visiting all parts of the Maryland Drydock operation, from the shops on shore
                    to the most distant ships at outfitting piers. It was my time for saying
                    goodbye, and I was quite sentimental about leaving. I shook many a grimy and
                    calloused hand that day, for after four years I had care to know more than a
                    thousand of our yard employees by first names and they had come to know me.
                    American industrial workers, I had learned, were a pretty fine group of people —
                    earnest, hard-working, cooperative, and strongly aware of their
                    responsibilities. I well knew that many a worker I said goodbye to that day, and
                    this was especially true of our foremen and supervisors, had worked his heart
                    out during the war years, sixty, seventy, even eighty hours a week; they had
                    worked week-days, Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays, often until late at night.
                    Their spirit was one I admired enormously and I was proud to have been
                    associated with them.</p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>I learned a great deal from my shipyard experiences — how to understand
                    individuals whose background was often quite different from my own, how to work
                    cooperatively with a variety of people and in turn to obtain their cooperation,
                    how to fit my personal efforts into the framework of a large organization, how
                    to learn from my shipyard colleagues whose expertise I needed, and how to
                    organize a staff of my own and supervise it successfully. One of the books I had
                    read at Harvard was particularly valuable to me — The Functions of the
                    Executive, by Chester I. Barnard. From it I learned that authority — effective
                    authority — is never delegated downward from the superior to the subordinate,
                    but always upward, from the subordinate to the superior; that no executive has
                    any real authority except that which is recognized by the people who work under
                    him and who freely grant it to him. I learned also the proper nature of decision
                    — that some decisions are positive and creative and some are routine, but that
                    the most important decisions are negative. By this terminology Barnard means
                    decisions not to decide, but to hold up, obtain more information, and make sure
                    of one's ground. Most successful executives make more negative decisions than
                    any other kind, for if one delays action and studies a decision, it will be
                    wiser in the end and quite possibly need not be made at all.</p>
                <p>Before going to work in industry, I had been responsible for my own work as a
                    journalist, but not for the work of others. The four years of immensely
                    difficult and strenuous work I had at the Maryland Drydock Company were a
                    necessary preparation for my next career, that with the U.S. Department of State
                    and Foreign Service. I had already learned a great deal about being an
                    organizational operator and executive. Now I needed to apply these lessons on a
                    vastly more important stage.</p>
                <p>Starting With the State Department</p>
                <p>The Scene Shifts to Washington</p>
                <p>Friends of mine have often expressed amazement that I should move to the United
                    States Department of State from a position training shipyard workers. I suppose
                    it does sound unlikely, but actually I was better fitted for my government
                    responsibilities in Washington than I had been four years earlier for my war
                    work for the Maryland Drydock Company, which had required enormously difficult
                    adjustments.</p>
                <p>What happened was that I started looking for a new job in the spring of 1945 when
                    I could see that our work for the Navy was tapering off rapidly. The Navy had
                    laid extensive plans to defeat Japan, and those plans were substantially
                    completed when yards like ours completed our outfitting contracts and delivered
                    the ships. There were various things I could do next. I could stay in industrial
                    personnel work, in which after four years I had earned a certain reputation; I
                    could return to newspaper journalism; or I could return to the ambition I had
                    had before the war, to enroll at Harvard or some other large university and
                    attempt an academic career.</p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>As things worked out, I did none of these things. I was offered a position at
                    Harvard as director of the University News Office, on the recommendation of
                    Louis Lyons of the Nieman Foundation. In fact, I was offered the job a second
                    time at a higher salary when President James B. Conant thought I was being
                    reluctant. But something very interesting turned up in Washington. Through
                    friends I was introduced to the Department of State's Office of Foreign Service,
                    which was striving to recruit an individual with suitable experience to plan a
                    postwar in-service training program for Foreign Service officers. I was
                    interviewed by an attractive young career diplomat by the name of Alan N.
                    Steyne. We clicked like magic. The more he talked about plans, the more exciting
                    the job seemed and the more we exchanged ideas, the more pleased Steyne and I
                    were with each other. There were formalities involved, of course. Steyne's
                    superior, an officer named Selden Chapin who was Director of the Office of the
                    Foreign Service, had to approve me. And I had to undergo a background and
                    security investigation. But Steyne seemed very sure that I was the man he was
                    looking for, and I was equally sure that I wanted the job.</p>
                <p>I had one important question to ask, and it was answered promptly in the
                    affirmative. I knew very little about the Foreign Service, and it was essential
                    that I be sent abroad to study its operations and meet and talk with its people.
                    Could this be arranged? Of course, Steyne assured me. He would have Chapin
                    employ me at first in the Foreign Service Auxiliary, a temporary wartime
                    personnel category with no Civil Service or other formal requirements. Then I
                    could be sent out to visit a number of embassies and consulates. I could go
                    first to some nearby Latin American posts, such as those in Mexico and Cuba.
                    Later on OFS (as Chapin's Office was called in the Department's shorthand) would
                    wish to send me to Western Europe, to be familiarized with the large and complex
                    London and Paris embassies. Steyne also thought I should go to Cairo, which was
                    the headquarters for a number of specialists covering various aspects of
                    economics and politics in the Middle East.</p>
                <p>It was explained to me carefully that what OFS had eventually in mind was to set
                    up some kind of staff college in the Foreign Service, similar to those which the
                    Armed Forces had always operated in the military services. This staff college
                    would give career officers of the Foreign Service advanced in-service training
                    at various stages of their careers, and it would arrange for many of them to be
                    trained in specialized aspects of Foreign Service work, such as international
                    economics and finance, aviation matters, petroleum developments, agricultural
                    economics, and labor affairs. A candidate was already in mind to head this staff
                    college, a former State Department executive who was then on the faculty at
                    Princeton University. But he was a man in his sixties, wise and scholarly rather
                    than young and imaginative, and Steyne and Chapin thought that someone my age
                    with practical experience in setting up and operating training programs would be
                    needed to function as his deputy. OFS already was operating short courses to
                    prepare new officers and clerical personnel for field duty, but the whole idea
                    of advanced and specialized training later on was a relatively new concept.</p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>My imagination was fired by the thought that I could help bring a great deal of
                    new life and new expertise into the Department of State and Foreign Service, and
                    participate in developing a splendid new diplomatic organization for the postwar
                    period in which the United States would be playing a new leadership role in
                    world affairs. I needed to learn a lot about the responsibilities of our career
                    diplomatic personnel, and the exact work which they did both in Washington and
                    in their overseas assignments. But I also felt that my educational experience
                    had been extensive for a person my age (which was 37 that year) and that I had
                    learned a great deal in industry about how to set up training programs which
                    would be practical and successful.</p>
                <p>State Department and Foreign Service</p>
                <p>At this point I had better explain to readers a rather complicated relationship,
                    that between the State Department and the Foreign Service. The State Department
                    in Washington, which in 1945 had about 3,500 employees, was our Cabinet
                    department for dealing with foreign affairs. It was operated under the rules of
                    the Federal Civil Service and staffed by permanent personnel who worked in
                    Washington and were not subject to foreign duty. In addition, however, there
                    were a hundred or so members of the Foreign Service who might at any given time
                    be detailed to duty in the Department.</p>
                <p>The Foreign Service was the Department's overseas branch, and was operated as a
                    separate personnel system which in its structure resembled the Army and Navy.
                    Young men and women were commissioned as Foreign Service Officers, or FSOs, in
                    the bottom grades, just as young West Point graduates started out as second
                    lieutenants and Annapolis graduates as ensigns. They would be assigned first to
                    quite junior duties and responsibilities, usually as vice consuls or third
                    secretaries, then gradually brought along and promoted from time to time as they
                    gained experience. The great majority of FSOs were on foreign duty, but several
                    dozen were needed in Washington, where they were usually placed in jobs
                    requiring overseas diplomatic experience, or assigned to the various divisions
                    of OFS which administered the Foreign Service. Overseas the Foreign Service
                    included not only State Department types, but commercial, agricultural and labor
                    attach�s whose Washington connections were with the Departments of Commerce,
                    Agriculture, and Labor. The concept was that a single unified Foreign Service
                    would do all the overseas reporting and other work of civilian Washington
                    agencies. This unified service was administered by the State Department, which
                    was, however, responsible to an inter-departmental body known as the Board of
                    Foreign Service.</p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>Like all bureaucratic arrangements, this one rarely worked exactly as it was
                    supposed to. The Foreign Service Act of 1924 had brought the consular and
                    diplomatic establishments into a single Foreign Service, and further legislation
                    in 1939 had added the commercial and agricultural attach�s and other specialists
                    working abroad for various Federal agencies. But by the time I entered
                    government service there were many frictions and disagreements, and new
                    legislation was under consideration to put the Foreign Service on a better basis
                    for the postwar period. There were also at this point a number of temporary
                    wartime agencies operating both in Washington and overseas which had to be
                    liquidated. These included the Foreign Economic Administration, which had been
                    engaged in economic warfare with the Axis powers; the Office of War Information,
                    which had been carrying on an information and propaganda operation; and the
                    Office of Strategic Services, which had been engaged both in wartime
                    intelligence and in “special operations.”</p>
                <p>The traditional State Department had a reputation for stodginess, and had been
                    bypassed during the war when all these special agencies were created. In 1945,
                    with the war grinding to a close, it was obvious that a completely new
                    Department of State would be needed, with many new functions, and that a much
                    improved and expanded Foreign Service would likewise be required. Thus the
                    governmental situation relating to foreign affairs was in a state of transition,
                    and was both chaotic and fluid, with no one sure just what was likely to
                    happen.</p>
                <p>The End of the War Years</p>
                <p>To return to my personal story, I was sworn into the Foreign Service Auxiliary on
                    July 30, 1945 at a salary which was equivalent to what I was supposed to get
                    later in the Civil Service, that of a GS-14. Alan Steyne and I discussed the
                    plan for me to proceed abroad for my educational tour, and it was decided that I
                    would leave in about two weeks for Mexico City, where Ambassador George S.
                    Messersmith was in charge. Messersmith had the reputation of being one of our
                    most effective ambassadors, and Steyne, who had worked under him in Germany and
                    knew him well, thought that his efficient embassy would be a good place for me
                    to begin. I spent the intervening time learning as much as I could about the
                    Department of State, reading various analytical reports on the Foreign Service
                    which Steyne gave me, talking to as many of my new colleagues as I could, and
                    sitting in on some of the classes for new personnel being operated by the
                    Division of Training Services.</p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>I should explain more fully who Chapin and Steyne were. They were both Foreign
                    Service officers of career — FSOs — who were on Washington assignments. Chapin
                    had come most recently from the Paris embassy, where he had served as a
                    Counselor with the rank of Minister, the number two position under Ambassador
                    Jefferson Caffery. Steyne was younger and served as a special assistant to
                    Chapin. He had come most recently from the London embassy and was a specialist
                    in economic reporting, a field in which he had won an outstanding reputation.
                    Brilliant and imaginative, he was Chapin's best idea man, and was working at a
                    dozen different projects to improve the quality of the Foreign Service. There
                    were six divisions of OFS which reported to Chapin. These had to do with Foreign
                    Service planning, administration, personnel operations, training, reporting
                    activities, and operation of buildings abroad.</p>
                <p>Celebrating VJ Day</p>
                <p>Two days before I was to leave for Mexico City, I spent the day in Washington,
                    having commuted by train from Baltimore as usual in order to complete my travel
                    preparations. I was to have dinner with Steyne at the nearby Metropolitan Club
                    that evening and obtain his final instructions. This led to a memorable
                    experience which I shall describe to conclude this chapter and to mark the
                    beginning of my new career with the State Department and Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>Because Steyne followed the usual State Department custom of working long hours,
                    he would not be ready to go to dinner until 7 o'clock. I waited for him in the
                    lounge of the old State Department building next door to the White House, now
                    known as the Executive Office Building. Washington was agog that day with
                    tension and excitement, for every one knew that American surrender demands had
                    been transmitted to Japan through neutral channels and that an answer could come
                    back at any time.</p>
                <p>Some time after 6 p.m. I suddenly became aware of a pandemonium of sound coming
                    into our building from Pennsylvania Avenue outside. It was a great blaring of
                    automobile horns, tooting like mad. It could mean only one thing — that the
                    Japanese had given in to American surrender terms, and that the news had been
                    picked up on automobile radios. World War II was over! Victory had come at last,
                    and millions of servicemen would be coming home.</p>
                <p>I walked to the front of our building and looked out on a very over-active street
                    scene. Auto horns were tooting crazily and making a terrific racket. Many people
                    were on foot, running along the sidewalk in the direction of the White House.
                    There were hundreds and hundreds of them, suddenly appearing from all
                    directions. There seemed to be a common impulse to stage a dramatic victory
                    celebration. I thought I might as well join the fun, so walked down the steps of
                    our building and followed the crowd along Pennsylvania Avenue to the point
                    opposite the north portico of the White House where a great throng was rapidly
                    forming along the guarded picket fence of the presidential property.</p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>The crowd shouted for the President, and in a few minutes Mr. Truman appeared on
                    the north portico and waved. There was more yelling and a great clapping of
                    hands. The mood was of euphoric intoxication.</p>
                <p>“We want to see Bess,” someone shouted, and the crowd took up the chant. The
                    President waved, went back inside, and a few moments later reappeared with Mrs.
                    Truman, who joined him in waving to the crowd, and blew them kisses. Still the
                    crowd was not satisfied. It kept growing larger and making more noise. Finally
                    Mr. and Mrs. Truman, accompanied by Secret Service guards, came down the steps.
                    They walked across the White House grass, then along the fence, smiling and
                    shaking hands. There were thousands of outreached hands as everyone strained to
                    touch them, even if only with finger tips.</p>
                <p>I watched all this for some time, fascinated. As I stood there, I thought to
                    myself, by God, this is wonderful. For four years my country has been engaged in
                    a colossal world war, the greatest military conflict of human history. Now the
                    war is over. The victory has been won. And I am attending a great spontaneous
                    celebration, not just with ordinary people, but with my President! What a
                    marvelous moment, a moment to treasure always a glamorous memory.</p>
                <p>And then on to dinner with Alan, on to an evening spent working my way by trolley
                    through the crowded streets to Union Station, onto a train for Baltimore to be
                    with my family, and two days later, onto Mexico City. My new career had begun
                    just as the sun was rising on the postwar world. And I was to be part of
                    America's role in that world for the next twenty-three years.</p>
                <p>First Impressions of the Foreign Service</p>
                <p>The Embassy at Mexico City</p>
                <p>Two days after the Japanese surrender I boarded an Eastern Air Lines plane that
                    connected in Brownsville — then as now a small city on the Texas side of the Rio
                    Grande — with a Pan-American flight to Mexico City. Both flights were in DC-3's,
                    two-motored planes which carried 21 passengers and flew at low altitudes,
                    between 4,000 and 6,000 feet. Our first flight made frequent stops, including
                    Atlanta, New Orleans, and Houston. The passenger terminals at each stop were
                    small frame buildings. It was my first air flight and far more enjoyable than
                    flying high above the clouds in today's huge airliners. We could see everything
                    below us with great clarity — the farmers tilling their fields, the cattle and
                    other livestock grazing, the houses and barns, the villages and towns connected
                    by ribbons of highways along which tiny automobiles sped. Never having flown
                    before, I was fascinated and completely charmed. What a marvelous way to travel,
                    I thought.</p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>It took us all day to get to Brownsville in late afternoon, and then we had to
                    wait until dark for our Mexico City flight to take off. Later I learned that it
                    was considered dangerous to fly over the Mexican highlands in the afternoon
                    hours, for the bright sun beating down on the heated earth caused vertical
                    currents of air — updrafts and dawn-drafts — which made planes uncontrollable at
                    times. Night flying was relatively smooth, and we landed safely about midnight.
                    A limousine deposited me about 1 a.m. at the Hotel Geneva, located on a broad
                    avenue in a pleasant residential section of the Mexican capital. I was glad to
                    get a night's sleep before visiting the nearby American embassy and obtaining my
                    first glimpse of the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>Despite the cordial relationships I had developed with Steyne, Chapin, and others
                    in Washington, I was not at all sure that the career FSOs I was about to meet
                    would be glad to see me, for this was a different environment. I was acutely
                    aware that I was an outsider, wholly new to the US diplomatic establishment and
                    with no background to speak of in foreign affairs. My stereotype of the Foreign
                    Service was that it was made up of proud, aloof people, products of New England
                    prep schools and Ivy League colleges. I was not lacking in self-confidence, but
                    thought it quite possible that my appearance might be regarded as a disagreeable
                    intrusion and that I might have some difficulty establishing rapport for the
                    first few days. My background in newspaper work and industry seemed to me
                    unlikely to inspire much respect.</p>
                <p>These were the thoughts passing through my mind that first morning in Mexico City
                    as I walked slowly around the block from my hotel to the embassy, gathering my
                    thoughts and thinking carefully just how I might best explain my mission and
                    what I hoped to accomplish. I had been told by Steyne to ask first for the
                    Administrative Officer, Carl W. Strom, and in a few minutes I was ushered into
                    the presence of a rather solemn man in his forties who greeted me cordially but,
                    I thought, with a certain wariness. My first impression of Strom was that he was
                    prematurely bald, used the English language in a rather precise,
                    school-teacherish manner, and seemed quite stiff. Later I was to learn that he
                    was the son of a Norwegian Lutheran pastor in Minnesota, had taught Greek and
                    mathematics at his Alma Mater, Luther College in Iowa, had a Ph.D. from the
                    University of Illinois, and had served for three years as a Rhodes Scholar at
                    Oxford. I was also to learn later that his doctoral field was mathematics, but
                    that he was a great Shakespeare enthusiast who knew by heart all the most famous
                    speeches and sonnets, that when traveling he carried with him always a copy of
                    the Greek New Testament to read at odd moments, that he was very fond of music
                    and all the performing arts, and that he was a warm-hearted and friendly man
                    with a delightful sense of humor. Not much of this came through at first
                    acquaintance, however, and I would have been astonished if it had been predicted
                    to me that this solemn and scholarly man was to become for the next twenty-three
                    years my warmest and closest friend in the Foreign Service.</p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>Strom did his best in our first conversation to put me at ease, saying that he
                    had enough confidence in Chapin and others in OFS to feel certain that they
                    would not send on such a mission as mine a man who was not qualified to be of
                    meaningful assistance to the Foreign Service. He assured me that everyone in the
                    Embassy knew of my expected arrival, and that everyone was prepared to receive
                    me cordially and to help me learn about the Service. When Strom and I exchanged
                    biographical information about personal backgrounds we soon found we had much in
                    common. Among the facts on my side which helped were the fact that my
                    grandfather was a Protestant clergyman, that I had studied Greek in college and
                    could quote from the gospels in that language, and that I had lived in Minnesota
                    and traveled in Iowa and South Dakota. Conversely, I was delighted, of course,
                    to find myself chatting with such a highly educated man, whose scholarly
                    interests overlapped with my own; and the more I saw of him the more I admired
                    and liked him.</p>
                <p>Strom's first duty was to take me to pay my respects to Ambassador Messersmith.
                    Having never before met an Ambassador, I looked at him with considerable
                    interest as he greeted me. He was a man about sixty, of medium height, very
                    dapperly dressed with a silvery edge to his waistcoat and a red carnation in his
                    lapel. If memory serves me correctly, he wore pince-nez attached to his coat by
                    a long black ribbon. He had a great deal of presence and oozed dignity and
                    authority. He asked Strom to leave me with him for a bit, and then questioned me
                    closely as to my desires and what I had in mind. I needed, I told him, to
                    understand just as thoroughly as was humanly possible what the people of the
                    Foreign Service were like, what their ideas were on the improvements needed for
                    the postwar years, and exactly what duties each person performed and for what
                    purposes. His embassy had been selected for introductory study because of the
                    reputation he had in Washington for running a highly effective diplomatic
                    mission. The Ambassador listened attentively to my little speech and seemed to
                    approve of what I said. All right, he said finally, he thought I had come to the
                    right place, and he would pass the word on to his staff to cooperate with me. He
                    recommended that I spend several weeks in the embassy proper, studying the work
                    of each section, and then travel around Mexico a bit to visit several
                    consulates. I should work closely with Strom, a sound officer who would be a
                    helpful guide. Strom should bring me to the weekly staff meetings which the
                    Ambassador held on Monday afternoon for this would be a good way to gain an
                    insight into embassy operations and responsibilities.</p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>When I reported back to Strom and told him of my interview, he said that
                    obviously I had made a satisfactory first impression and laid the proper
                    foundation for my study. He then took me on a tour of the Embassy, introducing
                    me to the chiefs of the principal sections — political, economic, and consular.
                    Later he would take me to two parts of the Embassy housed outside the main
                    building. One was the visa office, two blocks away; the other was the economic
                    and commercial section, located a mile away on a main street leading to the
                    center of the city. Strom said that I could start with the administrative
                    section, which he himself headed, and that he would explain as best he could how
                    the whole mission operated. He assigned me an office next to his own, complete
                    with typewriter, and to make me feel more welcome suggested we should start out
                    on first-name terms.</p>
                <p>In this friendly atmosphere Strom and I had several long and intimate talks over
                    the next few days, and when Sunday came he invited me to visit his home in
                    Chapultepec Hills and meet his family. I learned many things from Strom very
                    quickly. Career FSOs were not snobbish, he said, but often a bit leery of
                    newcomers and outsiders because they had come to feel neglected and unfairly
                    treated by the system. Under wartime conditions a large number of Foreign
                    Service Auxiliary people had been added to the Service to perform additional
                    duties, mostly of a specialized economic nature. These men had been employed by
                    the Department at the current rates of pay for professional people, and tended
                    to have much higher salaries than FSOs. Yet the latter had been selected by a
                    very rigorous examination system, on the presumption that they represented the
                    highest quality of Americans available, with outstanding abilities. Strom
                    himself, a Ph.D. who had been a Rhodes Scholar, had entered the Service in 1935,
                    after three years on the waiting list, yet had been infrequently promoted and
                    was still at a base salary of only $4,500 — a figure which I was embarrassed to
                    note, because it was $2,000 less than the Department was paying me. There was a
                    great deal of tension between the regular Foreign Service and the members of the
                    Auxiliary, but Strom felt that the Auxiliary people were needed and that many
                    were fully as capable as their FSO colleagues. A lot of the jealousy and
                    resentment would disappear, he said, if only the Department would raise FSO
                    salaries and provide more promotions.</p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>Strom told me briefly about his own career. He had served in Vancouver and
                    Zurich, assigned to consular duties, then had had a tour doing administrative
                    work in the Department. He had been in Mexico for two years, and at the age of
                    45 still had not had an opportunity to perform political and economic work — the
                    substantive work of diplomacy which had originally attracted him into the
                    Service. When I asked him for his objective evaluation of what he had seen so
                    far, he said that he liked the Foreign Service and that he had found that it
                    contained many superior individuals. On the other hand, he thought that many
                    officers were of only mediocre ability and that a few were of such inferior
                    calibre that they should be weeded out. This was particularly true of some of
                    the old commercial specialists who had been blanketed in when State took over
                    responsibility for trade promotion work. There were also some mediocre officers
                    who had become FSOs by the “back door” route. This was the loophole that
                    permitted clerical employees to become career officers after five years of
                    subordinate duty without going through the whole examination procedure; they
                    could be approved solely on the basis of an oral examination. Such officers,
                    Strom told me, tended to be industrious and useful rather than intellectual or
                    imaginative. They were not likely to be promoted to the top ranks of the
                    Service.</p>
                <p>Analyzing Foreign Service Problems</p>
                <p>As I worked away over the next several weeks, interviewing every American
                    employee individually and chatting also with some of the non-Americans, I kept
                    careful notes on each person's education and background. At the end of each day
                    I pounded my typewriter for several hours, putting on paper for future reference
                    interesting facts and opinions that I had collected. This was also to be my
                    procedure later on when my orientation tour was extended to Europe and the
                    Middle East.</p>
                <p>I found that it was extremely fruitful to discuss my initial impressions with
                    Carl Strom, as our acquaintance ripened into friendship. I might leap ahead of
                    my story at this point and say that this impressive officer, so stingily treated
                    and exploited in the first ten years of his Foreign Service career, was later to
                    be recognized for his quite extraordinary intelligence and ability. In his final
                    years as an FSO he became the acting chief of our diplomatic mission in Korea
                    for over a year, then Ambassador to Cambodia and after that Ambassador to
                    Bolivia. There is an old saying that merit will eventually be rewarded, and the
                    Strom story had a happy ending.</p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>After interviewing a goodly portion of the Embassy officers and discussing my
                    tentative reactions with Strom, I sat down and wrote a report to Chapin, telling
                    him all that I had been doing and what my initial conclusions were. One thought
                    that I had was that those FSOs who had come into the Service by the examination
                    route immediately after college graduation were less impressive than their
                    colleagues who had made their livings in other ways for a few years before
                    turning to diplomacy. Another was that consular and administrative duties, in
                    which officers dealt every day with practical problems, provided a lot better
                    training than sitting in a political section writing analytical reports based
                    largely on newspaper stories. It was a well-known fact in the Foreign Service
                    that political reporting and contact work was more generously rewarded in future
                    assignments and promotions than any other type of work, but when I looked at
                    some of the reports being produced it seemed to me that any experienced
                    newspaper man could do as well or better. In short, the best rewards came from
                    doing the easiest work, whereas officers struggling with consular problems, far
                    more difficult in nature, tended to be overlooked and neglected.</p>
                <p>I also took the opportunity in my letter to Chapin to praise Strom and recommend
                    that he be brought back to Washington to work on plans for improving the Foreign
                    Service. I received in response a cordial note from Chapin in which he assured
                    me that Strom was already very much under consideration for the new Division of
                    Foreign Service Planning. Chapin also seemed favorably impressed with the ideas
                    I had developed, and instructed me to extend my tour and before returning to
                    Washington to spend some time at the American Embassy in Havana, Cuba.</p>
                <p>It was easy to make friends, I found, among the embassy officers, who seemed
                    pleased that someone from Washington was interested in them. Soon I was being
                    invited out to parties where I could socialize with both Americans and Mexicans
                    and where I could also meet representatives of other diplomatic missions in
                    Mexico City. I also was able to take a number of out-of-town trips with embassy
                    officers. One was to Puebla, Mexico's fourth largest city, with the officer
                    handling civil aviation affairs. Another was to Cuernavaca, where I went out
                    with one of the vice consuls on what was called a protection case, having to do
                    with the welfare of American citizens. This case was interesting enough to
                    describe in these pages. Two middle-aged American schoolteachers, both widows,
                    had driven down into Mexico on a sightseeing tour. Along the way they had picked
                    up two handsome young Mexicans, who traveled with them for several days. But the
                    young gigolos, if I may use such a term, were playing a game of their own. One
                    evening they lured the American women out to a lonely spot “to see a beautiful
                    sunset.” When the Americans got out of their car, the Mexicans produced a gun,
                    pumped bullets into them, then appropriated the car and departed for parts
                    unknown. One woman was fatally shot, but the other was only wounded and was
                    hospitalized in Cuernavaca. The vice consul whom I accompanied was there to get
                    the full story from the local police, recover the baggage of the deceased
                    victim, check on the hospitalized survivor, and insist to authorities that the
                    criminals must be apprehended and brought to justice. I found the whole affair
                    fascinating.</p>
                <p>Visiting Consulates in Mexico</p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>Soon after this I was able to visit two outlying consulates, those at Mazatlan
                    and Guadalajara. I traveled with the assistant naval attach� for air and his
                    enlisted-man co-pilot in a two-motored Beechcraft plane; they were delivering
                    pouches and making routine inspections. Mazatlan was a small seaport on the Gulf
                    of Mexico, but the harbor was so badly silted up that the port had little
                    remaining importance. The consul and vice-consul there were doing routine work,
                    issuing visas, invoicing shipments of winter vegetables to U.S. destinations,
                    and looking out for a few tourists who came down from California. Guadalajara,
                    on the other hand, seemed quite a busy and important city, Mexico's third
                    largest. It was in the mountains, but at a lower and more comfortable altitude
                    than Mexico City, 6,000 feet against 7,500. It was a pleasant city with a mild
                    climate and had the reputation of being one of the Foreign Service's most
                    desirable posts. The Navy lieutenant, the co-pilot and I enjoyed sitting in
                    open-air cafes and being serenaded by an endless succession of mariachi street
                    bands who played haunting Mexican folk melodies of a highly nostalgic nature. It
                    was Mexico at its most charming. The consul there was an up-and-coming man of 43
                    with a handle-bar moustache who was much excited by my visit. He wanted to get
                    out a set of blueprints and convince me why he needed additional rent money to
                    acquire more office space. When I explained apologetically that I was not a
                    Foreign Service inspector and had no authority over such matters, he was
                    disappointed.</p>
                <p>“Sorry, I just mistook the purpose of your visit,” he said wearily as he folded
                    up his blueprints. “But when I heard you were from the Department, I was hoping
                    I could make some hay. Damn it all, Hopkins, I've been in the Foreign Service
                    fifteen years now, and I have yet to lay eyes on an inspector!”</p>
                <p>We were taken to lunch at the consul's home that day, the lieutenant and I. It
                    was in a suburb some miles from the city proper, and all the houses were
                    surrounded by adobe mud walls that reminded me of Taos and Santa Fe. Our host
                    stopped and unlocked a heavy wooden door in one of these walls. A moment later
                    we were warmly greeted by a bouncy blonde lady, the consul's wife, who said what
                    sounded to me like “Welcome to Tlocky-Pocky!” I found out later what she meant;
                    the name of the suburb was Tlaquepaque. Their home turned out to be absolutely
                    delightful. It was built on the old Roman plan, a hollow quadrangle with an open
                    patio and fountain in the center. Mr. and Mrs. James Henderson, for that was
                    their name, had served in posts in Syria and Latvia from which they had brought
                    many beautiful objects they were now enjoying in a Mexican setting. It was
                    interesting to see one of the more glamorous aspects of life in the Foreign
                    Service.</p>
                <p>Next morning we flew back to Mexico City with the hot sun beating down on us, and
                    I got a demonstration of why one doesn't fly over the Mexican highlands after
                    midday. Toward noon our light plane began bucking and bouncing around as
                    vertical air currents hit it, and it was all our two pilots could do to hold it
                    on course. We landed in a heavy sweat, in which I shared fully. It felt good to
                    be on the ground again.</p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>Back in Mexico City I continued interviewing members of the Embassy staff and
                    learning about the Foreign Service. I talked with the supervising Consul General
                    for Mexico, Maurice L. Stafford, a tall man of distinguished appearance,
                    originally from St. Joseph, Missouri, and he told me that there were nineteen
                    consulates in Mexico. Seven were along the country's border with the United
                    States, and the other twelve were located either in seaports or at important
                    inland mining and manufacturing centers. There are many fewer today, but the
                    consulates in Mexico had been important during World War II as centers from
                    which to combat the extensive Axis anti-Allied propaganda and from which also to
                    carry out programs of economic warfare involving strategic minerals, such as
                    Mexican mercury, which the Nazis were seeking to import.</p>
                <p>Stafford's deputy, Forrest K. Geerken, handled miscellaneous consular duties, one
                    of which was to keep track of the estates of American citizens dying in Mexico
                    and see that their effects were recovered for their families in the United
                    States. He took me one day into a locked storage room of the Embassy and showed
                    me an impressive stack of trunks, suitcases, duffle bags, golf clubs, and other
                    minor property collected from deceased Americans. It was all waiting to be
                    claimed by relatives.</p>
                <p>“Here, hold out your hand,” he said to me as he picked up a rubber sack and
                    untied the drawstring. He poured a pinch of grey powder into my palm.</p>
                <p>“What is it?” I asked, drawing back apprehensively.</p>
                <p>“These are the ashes of a lady from Michigan who died here recently. Her last
                    wishes were that her body should be cremated and the ashes distributed by a
                    plane flying at 5,000 feet over Cuernavaca. I am negotiating now for a pilot to
                    carry out this mission.”</p>
                <p>Other consular employees in Mexico City were working either on passports,
                    citizenship problems, and the needs of American citizens, or on the very
                    extensive workload of visa applications from Mexicans seeking to travel or study
                    in the United States or to immigrate permanently. I saw long lines of visa
                    applicants waiting in the street outside the visa office — a sight which was to
                    greet me for the next several months in every country which I visited. I
                    carefully interviewed the officers handling consular matters and then worked my
                    way through the economic and political sections as well, learning a great deal
                    about the Mexican economy, about trade promotion work, and about the political
                    developments which were being reported by the three FSOs assigned to this
                    work.</p>
                <p>A Day with the Ambassador</p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>Where I learned most about problems in Mexican-American political and economic
                    relationships was in the Ambassador's weekly staff meetings, which I attended
                    regularly. Messersmith kept his staff fully informed on his conversations with
                    high officials in Washington, with whom he talked frequently by telephone, and
                    also those he had with the Mexican President and his cabinet ministers. He used
                    his staff meetings to instruct all embassy section chiefs on exactly what he
                    thought about important issues and impending events. He was an authoritative
                    person and expressed his ideas with emphatic clarity.</p>
                <p>After one of these meetings, the Ambassador asked me how my study was
                    progressing. When I responded favorably, he suggested that perhaps it was time
                    for me to get first-hand information on the work of an ambassador. I should
                    report to his office next morning, and he would let me sit in the background
                    with my notebook and observe his activities while he went about his daily
                    business.</p>
                <p>So I came in next day, sat at a little side table which had been set up for me,
                    and for several hours watched and listened. A number of embassy officers came in
                    from time to time to report on some matter they were handling, or to ask for
                    further instructions. There were many telephone calls, some from Mexican
                    officials, some from American business leaders, some from embassy officers.
                    Three different secretaries came in during the day and took dictation on letters
                    and political reports the Ambassador was sending to Washington. Some of these
                    were long and detailed; Messersmith was not called in the Department of State
                    “forty-page George” without reason.</p>
                <p>The principal thing on the Ambassador's mind that morning was coffee prices. He
                    telephoned the Mexican desk officer in the Department of State, John Willard
                    Carrigan, and arranged with him to set up an important dinner meeting at the
                    Metropolitan Club three weeks hence. Every Cabinet officer with any
                    responsibility for commodity prices and international trade was to be invited,
                    and each was to be told not to send a substitute as a policy matter of great
                    importance to our relations with Latin American countries was to be discussed.
                    Messersmith then explained to me what the problem was. The wartime Office of
                    Price Administration was still holding down coffee prices set during the war,
                    and the level was so low that the coffee producers in Latin American countries
                    were losing money on every shipment. It was imperative to our relations with our
                    Western Hemisphere neighbors that coffee prices be allowed to rise. Did I have
                    any comment or questions?</p>
                <p>“You certainly know how to get things done in Washington,” I ventured. “But where
                    does Mexico fit in? I didn't realize that this country was a major coffee
                    producer.”</p>
                <p>“That's not the point. Mexico has less coffee to sell than Brazil or Colombia.
                    But all Latin America is suffering because of our rigid price policies. The
                    Department is not giving this matter the attention it deserves, so I must go to
                    Washington and force through a change of policy.”</p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>I made appropriately admiring remarks, and then continued to take notes as the
                    Ambassador went through a busy day. I began to think after a while that this was
                    not an average day, but one which Messersmith had carefully chosen in order to
                    put on a dramatic show for my benefit.</p>
                <p>Finally in late afternoon the Ambassador dismissed his last caller, tipped his
                    chair back, and began to ask me questions about my impression of the Embassy. I
                    said that I had found it admirably organized and managed and that I had been
                    favorably impressed by the quality of the officers I had interviewed. Many
                    officers had talked to me frankly about their personal views on the Service, and
                    I had learned a great deal from them. But I was troubled, I said, by the morale
                    problems I had found. Many officers seemed to be neglected by the Department and
                    underpaid. It appeared to me a shame there could not be more promotions. Why
                    couldn't Strom, for example, a 45-year-old former Rhodes Scholar with a Ph.D.
                    degree and a fine record, be promoted to a higher class? He was eight years
                    older than I, but was getting less salary.</p>
                <p>“You are absolutely right,” said the Ambassador. “Fine officer. Backbone of the
                    Service. I've told Washington that it is exploiting the loyalty of our very best
                    people. I must get back to this problem and push much harder.”</p>
                <p>Messersmith went on to say that in recent years the Department of State had not
                    been staffed properly on the highest levels. He himself had served as Assistant
                    Secretary for Administration, but had been succeeded by a weak administrator who
                    had let things run downhill during the war. It was now high time that the
                    Department be reorganized and strengthened.</p>
                <p>When I got up to leave, I had a sudden impulse and made a little speech. I told
                    Ambassador Messersmith that the day had been very valuable to me not only for
                    what I had learned about ambassadorial responsibilities, but for what I had
                    learned about him as an individual. He was, I told him, a very different person
                    from the one his staff thought he was.</p>
                <p>“What do you mean? Explain yourself, young man.”</p>
                <p>“Well, Mr. Ambassador, your subordinates in the Embassy are very much in awe of
                    you. You are an authoritative person. You lay down the policy lines, you give
                    orders, and you are tough about expecting compliance. Every one thinks you are a
                    difficult man to work for.”</p>
                <p>“They do, eh? And what do you think?”</p>
                <p>“I think that you want your staff to think you are a tough boss, but that down
                    inside you are a sentimentalist. You are deeply concerned about the people who
                    work under you. You are fond of them and you try to look out for them, but you
                    don't want them to know it. What you feel about people is quite different from
                    what you show on the surface. Down inside you are a very warm person.”</p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>Messersmith looked at me in some astonishment, not quite sure how to deal with
                    this cheeky comment. Then his face relaxed into a guarded smile.</p>
                <p>“Well, that's an impertinent comment, Hopkins, a very impertinent comment. I
                    don't think anyone ever made such a statement to me. But you are perceptive, and
                    you may be right. Now get out of here before I say something I shouldn't!”</p>
                <p>When I told Carl Strom about this conversation next day, he was both amazed and
                    amused.</p>
                <p>“I think you're absolutely right,” he said. “Underneath all that plate armor of
                    austerity, Messersmith does care about people. I like him very much, myself;
                    wouldn't want to work for a better man. But I would never dare tell him so. He
                    would think I was trying to flatter him, and he would take my head off. But you
                    are a visitor, so you can get away with the remark you made. You found the chink
                    in his armor, and he may not like that. But I daresay that you've won his
                    respect.”</p>
                <p>Some More Impressions</p>
                <p>In addition to Strom, there were several other officers in Mexico City whom I
                    came to like, and some have remained friends of mine in all the years since. But
                    I also met some who seemed to me to have strange values, not at all in harmony
                    with my own. They were over-impressed with the importance of protocol, rank, and
                    privilege, for example, and antagonistic toward the Auxiliary officers who did
                    not, in their view, have the proper respect for diplomatic tradition.</p>
                <p>I shall tell one story. One evening a group of us in the political section of the
                    Embassy were chatting at quitting time, and one of them suggested we all go to
                    his nearby apartment for a drink, since his wife was away and he was temporarily
                    alone. While I was sipping my drink in his tastefully furnished living room, I
                    noticed two framed photographs prominently displayed on his grand piano. I
                    recognized them as the former King Carol of Romania, now living in exile as a
                    refugee, and his morganatic wife Magda Lupescu. I asked my host if I were
                    correct in my identifications.</p>
                <p>He swelled with pride and admitted that I was indeed correct.</p>
                <p>“Carol and Magda have become good friends of ours” he informed me. “We see them
                    often.”</p>
                <p>“Well, I suppose there's nothing wrong with your socializing with exiled royalty
                    if you find them agreeable,” I commented. “But Carol and his wife are not
                    particularly reputable people, and obviously have no present importance or
                    political future. It strikes me as a little strange that you as an American
                    diplomat, representing the policies and aspirations of the United States, would
                    be so proud of knowing these has-beens that you would display their photographs
                    prominently in your home. Do you really think it is fitting?”</p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>My host looked a bit taken aback, and I was not invited to his home again. But I
                    saw much during my visit which seemed to me lacking in the kind of seriousness
                    which I wanted to see in the Foreign Service of future years. I noted, for
                    example, that there was a great deal of partying in the Mexico City American
                    community. The Embassy officers were kind enough to invite me to a number of
                    receptions, where I met many pleasant people. But when I asked myself how
                    seriously all this activity contributed to American diplomacy, I was troubled.
                    For at eleven receptions which I attended, I noted the presence of Mexican
                    nationals at only two. Almost all the guests were Americans or Europeans.</p>
                <p>I stayed in Mexico altogether seven weeks. It was a fascinating experience for
                    me. The Foreign Service people whose minds I explored in hundreds of interviews
                    were quite different from what I expected. Only two or three FSOs with whom I
                    talked had attended an Ivy League college, or had come from anything that one
                    could call an elite social background. Almost every one was from some different
                    region or educational institution, and except for the total absence of blacks
                    the Embassy staff as a whole seemed broadly representative of the American
                    population. Several officers struck me as having superior abilities, and I met
                    only one or two whom I thought inadequate for postwar responsibilities, if one
                    allowed for the fact that much consular work was routine in nature and required
                    diligence rather than high intelligence. Most officers spoke Spanish with
                    reasonable fluency, but there were some who noticeably needed more language
                    training. All in all, it seemed to me that Foreign Service people in the Mexican
                    posts I visited were somewhat more than adequate for their responsibilities. The
                    really bright spot was Strom; I thought him much superior to his colleagues, and
                    he was the only officer I met on that trip who subsequently reached
                    ambassadorial rank.</p>
                <p>A Visit to Embassy Havana</p>
                <p>Toward the end of September I decided that I had reached the point of diminishing
                    returns in my study efforts and had better start back to Washington. I had one
                    more consulate to visit, the one at Merida, in Yucatan, where I stopped off for
                    two interesting days on my way to Cuba. The consul there, Steve Worster, was a
                    sturdy, practical young man, brought up on a farm in Maine. He was alone in
                    Merida, but seemed to have his job well under control. Yucatan was important to
                    the US Navy during the war years because the henequen grown there produced
                    fibers needed for making rope; it was a useful substitute for the hemp of the
                    Philippines which was not available during the Japanese occupation. I was taken
                    on a tour of the henequen fields and also of the decorticating plants where the
                    fibers were extracted and processed for export to the United States. My schedule
                    also permitted a brief visit to Uxmal, one of the nearby Mayan ruins so
                    fascinating to archaeologists.</p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>The American Embassy at Havana was smaller than the large establishment in Mexico
                    City, was not as competently organized and managed, and struck me as having a
                    less impressive staff. The Ambassador, R. Henry Norweb, was a product of the old
                    pre-1924 diplomatic service which emphasized social background, personal charm,
                    and smooth manners. He was very curious about me, and when I told him how I had
                    attended Messersmith's weekly staff meetings, he promptly invited me to attend
                    one of his the very next day. When all the officers were assembled, Norweb asked
                    each one to explain to me just what his job was, what he was accomplishing, and
                    what problems he was encountering. This was exactly what I wanted, of course,
                    and I took copious notes while the Ambassador, arms folded, listened
                    proudly.</p>
                <p>After the meeting, several officers approached me and thanked me warmly. What
                    for? I asked. I was then informed that this was the only staff meeting that any
                    one could recall the Ambassador ever calling. Each officer felt that for the
                    first time he had had an opportunity to let Norweb know what went on in his
                    particular section, and thus to get a little recognition. So I got credit for
                    having boosted morale, and all my individual interviews from then on were
                    particularly cordial. As in Mexico, I collected many case histories and added
                    additional pages to my fat sheaf of typewritten notes. Some of the ideas I was
                    given were useful, and I left after eight days feeling that I had made some new
                    friends and had increased my understanding of Foreign Service functions and
                    responsibilities.</p>
                <p>After two months in Mexico and Cuba, I returned to Washington well satisfied with
                    the beginning I had made. I still had seen only little corners of the Foreign
                    Service, but the work and the personalities fascinated me. I could see many
                    problems which required better personnel administration, including in-service
                    training and career development. One of the most obvious was poor morale, due
                    largely to inadequate communication between the management of the Service in
                    Washington and officers working in the field. Most officers felt badly
                    neglected, even forgotten, and wondered what the mysterious Department of State
                    was like and what it expected of them. But I found them all profoundly human and
                    genuinely friendly. I was already sure that I was going to like Foreign Service
                    people, on all levels from ambassadors to clerks, very, very much.</p>
                <p>The Middle East, London, and the Low Countries</p>
                <p>A Visit to the Middle East</p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>Upon returning to Washington, I was told by Chapin and Steyne that Foreign
                    Service personnel plans, which included the proposed new staff college, were
                    proceeding slowly and could not mature until new enabling legislation was passed
                    by Congress. A special team was being organized in the Division of Foreign
                    Service Planning to draft this legislation, and arrangements were in process to
                    bring Carl Strom to Washington to be put in charge of this work. Meanwhile, OFS
                    had been favorably impressed by the training plans I was putting on paper and
                    thought that I should continue my educational tour. It would be a good idea, my
                    mentors thought, for me to visit other geographic areas and see posts quite
                    different in character from those I had studied in Mexico and Cuba.</p>
                <p>This was sweet music to my ears, for I was keenly interested in seeing as much
                    and learning as much as I possibly could. Plans were worked out for me to spend
                    a week in Montreal in order to see a busy visa-issuing post, then to spend a
                    month in Cairo and nearby posts in Lebanon, Syria, and Palestine. After that I
                    should spend a couple more months in Western Europe, studying especially the
                    work of our two most important embassies, those in London and Paris. I made the
                    Montreal trip in October, then early in November reported at the Washington
                    Airport to take a DC-4 plane across the Atlantic to Cairo, with refueling stops
                    at Stevensville, Newfoundland; Santa Maria, in the Azores; Casablanca, Morocco;
                    and Tripoli, Libya. The flight was operated by the US Army's Air Transport
                    Command and I flew on military orders arranged by the State Department.
                    Commercial flights to Europe had not yet at that time been resumed.</p>
                <p>The importance of Cairo lay in the fact that a number of economic specialists
                    were stationed there who had regional responsibilities for much of the Arab
                    world. They were concerned with such matters as petroleum production, civil
                    aviation negotiations to obtain landing rights for American airlines, trade
                    promotion, agricultural development, the disposition of leftover military
                    supplies and equipment, and the beginnings of a Near East labor movement. There
                    were also still remnants in Cairo of the Office of War Information and the
                    Foreign Economic Administration, both in process of liquidation.
                    Responsibilities and operations were in a state of flux, and it was hoped that I
                    could make some useful observations and recommendations on what the postwar
                    Foreign Service should do about the leftover units.</p>
                <p>Before leaving Washington I had spent several weeks writing additional papers for
                    OFS. One of them dealt with introductory training for new FSOs. Another dealt at
                    some length with the clerical and secretarial personnel of the Foreign Service —
                    the indispensable subordinates without whom the officer personnel could not
                    effectively function. I had seen and talked with code clerks, file room
                    managers, secretaries, and administrative assistants, and had already reached
                    the conclusion that they were not receiving the attention they deserved, either
                    before leaving the Department or after arriving at embassies and consulates.
                    This was a matter already much on the minds of Strom in Mexico City and his
                    counterpart Richard F. Boyce in Havana.</p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>For the most part, I wrote, we recruited well-qualified people, attracted to the
                    Foreign Service by the glamorous prospect of traveling and living in foreign
                    countries. They needed relatively little technical instruction in office skills,
                    but far better orientation than they were receiving in what the Foreign Service
                    was all about and what it was like to live in foreign countries and have social
                    contacts with local people. They were going to be representatives of the United
                    States abroad, regardless of their rank, and in a very personal way they would
                    contribute to the impressions which foreigners have of the American way of life.
                    So I outlined a Washington orientation program for all newly employed clerks and
                    secretaries in which they would be psychologically prepared for life abroad and
                    impressed with the responsibilities which they would have as emissaries of good
                    will. I thought also that the administrative arrangements for their travel and
                    their reception at foreign posts should be improved, so that every new employee
                    would be met on arrival and carefully assisted to make initial living
                    arrangements. My paper also proposed that officer personnel should be instructed
                    to include their secretaries and other subordinates in Foreign Service social
                    life, and that every officer should be judged in his annual efficiency report on
                    how well he dealt with the needs of the employees under his supervision.</p>
                <p>During my time in Cairo I was glad I had written this paper, for I became quite
                    interested in the subordinate personnel at the Legation there. Several Foreign
                    Service girls who were stationed in Cairo had been recruited in Minnesota. It
                    was easy to establish rapport with them on the basis of my own familiarity with
                    the Twin Cities area, and I was invited to visit their apartments and see how
                    they lived, groups of bachelor girls together. Later on I was to talk to the
                    chief of the economic section of our embassy at Brussels who said to me, “Look,
                    I have eight of the most competent economic officers anyone could wish for. But
                    I don't have enough secretaries to type their reports, and I would gladly
                    exchange any two of my officers for a bright girl who could run my file room
                    efficiently!”</p>
                <p>The flight to Cairo was a slow one by today's standards. We left Washington on a
                    Friday morning, got to Newfoundland in the afternoon, spent the first night
                    crossing the Atlantic, had breakfast in the Azores, and then dinner that evening
                    in Casablanca. At each landing we were on the ground for some hours. The second
                    night we flew across northern Africa, by this time demoted to smaller plane, a
                    DC-3. We had breakfast in Tripoli, and after flying along the Mediterranean
                    coast of Libya arrived at the Cairo airport in mid-afternoon. It was a thrill
                    for me to look down on the long green ribbon of the Nile Valley as we passed
                    over it and circled so that we could get a good view of the famous Pyramids at
                    El Giza.</p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>It was not nearly so thrilling to land at the airport on Sunday afternoon and be
                    surrounded by Egyptians chattering in Arabic. There was no one from the American
                    Legation to meet me, and in fact no Americans or British in sight. I finally
                    managed to get a telephone call through to the Legation, and was told by the
                    Egyptian employee on Sunday duty at the switchboard that I should come on into
                    the city and register at famous Shepheard's Hotel, where a room would be engaged
                    for me. Wasn't there an American duty officer? For I knew that there was
                    supposed to be one. Well, yes, but he was spending the afternoon on the golf
                    course. He would get in touch with me at Shepheard's.</p>
                <p>The problem with this arrangement was that Shepheard's was filled up and had no
                    space. When I called the Legation again, I was asked please to sit in the lobby
                    until a hotel room could be found for me. I felt badly in need of a bath, after
                    some 56 hours of travel, but whiled away the time pleasantly by joining a lonely
                    British major for a drink in a corner of the lobby; he had come in from Suez for
                    a little Sunday relaxation and was glad to have company. Several times I
                    received telephone calls, including one from the duty officer, who apologized
                    for not greeting me in person, muttering “Sunday afternoon, you know!” somewhat
                    unconvincingly. Another call came from a more senior officer of the Legation, a
                    first secretary serving as charg� d'affaires during the absence of the Minister
                    Plenipotentiary, inviting me to join a group at his home for dinner. And finally
                    the switchboard operator did find me a room in a rather stodgy hotel which
                    seemed to be filled with British army officers.</p>
                <p>At the Charg�'s home that evening I was received hospitably and plied with food
                    and drink, but I was tired after my trip and not at my best. I remember that my
                    hostess, having grown up in the Foreign Service, the daughter of a famous
                    ambassador, was quite persistent in urging me to have the Department arrange
                    things in such a way that officers on transfer would be moved into furnished
                    quarters at each post and not have to bother with packing and unpacking their
                    own furniture, transported long distances at Government expense. Responding to
                    my host's excellent scotch highballs, I was not in a mood to take this idea
                    seriously, and in a spirit of levity made a further suggestion — that each
                    transferred officer not only inherit his predecessor's furnished quarters, but
                    also his wife and family. Then each officer would be interested in replacing a
                    colleague junior to himself, so that he could acquire a younger and prettier
                    wife; and for the sake of that bonus, he would be willing to move downward in
                    the Service to a lower rank and status. Counselors of embassy would became first
                    secretaries, first secretaries second secretaries, consuls general would be
                    denoted to consul and then on to vice consul. Eventually could have the whole
                    Service running backward instead of forward. All the tension about promotions to
                    higher ranks would disappear, for each officer's thoughts would be concentrated
                    on his prospects for a happy demotion.</p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>At first everyone seemed baffled by this mischievous nonsense, but as I rambled
                    on with elaborations my listeners caught on that I was just having fun and
                    finally started laughing. They began to make further suggestions, and we wound
                    up quite hilarious. Since I was billed as being from the sacred and
                    sanctimonious Department of State, some of those present must have thought that
                    the staid old Department was becoming a bit balmy in its old age.</p>
                <p>The Cairo Legation</p>
                <p>For the next several weeks my attention was riveted on the legation staff and
                    what each person's duties and problems were. I had lengthy interviews with all
                    American employees, a procedure which was helped along by the Legation's work
                    hours — starting at 8 a.m., stopping at 1 p.m. for a three-hour lunch break, and
                    resuming at 4 p.m. for three more hours. Each day I was invited home for
                    luncheon by someone, usually an officer, and we could cover a lot of ground in a
                    leisurely manner. Just as in Mexico and Cuba, I found FSOs not only willing to
                    talk to me freely, but delighted to be able to unburden themselves to a visitor
                    who would listen sympathetically to recitals of achievements and
                    frustrations.</p>
                <p>Thus I talked with a fiscal and accounting officer with a status-conscious East
                    European wife who was eating his heart out in misery because the two of them
                    were not on the diplomatic list; to an FSO administrative officer who hated his
                    job and yearned to be assigned to political reporting; and to a commercial
                    officer, also an FSO, who felt humiliated because the Minister had chosen a
                    younger and lower-ranking political officer to be in charge of the Legation
                    during his absence on home leave. This caused the Commercial officer's New
                    Zealand-born wife to lose status in the eyes of the British official community.
                    To make things worse, the Queen of Egypt was about to receive all the American
                    Legation wives at the royal palace. The New Zealand wife wanted the British
                    Ambassador's wife, not the young wife of the American charg� d'affaires, to
                    present the wives to the Queen at this reception, but no one would listen to her
                    proposal.</p>
                <p>And so it went. Along with the personal grievances of some officers I was
                    impressed with the deep seriousness of others. Many had interesting jobs, in
                    some cases taking them on trips to Saudi Arabia, Iraq, and even Iran, and I
                    learned a great deal from talking with them. I also had some personal visits to
                    places of interest, including archeological digs at El Giza and a half day
                    inspecting an oil-drilling site. I had many long walks through the streets of
                    Cairo, observing the dirt and misery of a poverty-stricken populace, and even
                    sampled a bit of night life to get my first sight of Middle Eastern belly
                    dancing.</p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>In the absence of the Minister I could not fully evaluate the Legation's
                    effectiveness, but it seemed to me that each officer at Cairo was “doing his own
                    thing” with little supervision and that there was a lack both of staff cohesion
                    and administrative control. The contrast with Messersmith's tight organization
                    in Mexico City could not have been sharper. The petroleum attach�, for example,
                    had excellent relationships with American oil company representatives, who kept
                    him well informed on all that was going on, but felt little obligation to share
                    his information with Washington, ignoring repeated urgent telegrams asking for
                    reports. He was only a temporary specialist, borrowed from a major oil company
                    for the duration, and was soon to return to his original employers. I was amazed
                    at his insouciance.</p>
                <p>A strange thing happened to me one day which illustrates how out of touch with
                    reality many Foreign Service people were in 1945. I had become quite friendly
                    with the charg�, whom I found personable, intelligent, and eager to please. One
                    Saturday morning one of our Egyptian messengers, a young man wearing a red
                    tarboosh, came rushing into my workroom. He told me excitedly that the charg�
                    d'affaires wanted me to join him immediately in the Minister's office —
                    immediately, at once, on a most urgent matter. I wondered what on earth could be
                    so urgent, while the messenger danced around me in an agony of impatience.</p>
                <p>Entering the Minister's office, I found the charg�, whom I shall call Ronald,
                    serving a morning cup of tea to a visitor — a carefully groomed elderly Arab
                    gentleman with a goatee, leaning on a gold-headed cane and wearing on his head
                    the usual red tarboosh. Ronald leapt to his feet, and with great deference
                    introduced me to “His Royal Highness Prince Mohammed Ali.” he described me to
                    the Prince, who it turned out was King Farouk's uncle and heir to his throne, as
                    a representative of the U.S. Department of State who was studying “the problems
                    of the Foreign Service.” Perhaps, Ronald suggested, His Royal Highness, who had
                    observed us over many years, could give me his ideas on deficiencies in our
                    Service and how they could</p>
                <p>I felt the hackles on the back of my neck begin to bristle and I am sure my face
                    was reddening with anger. Why on earth should I care what this aging scion of
                    third-rate royalty in what was then an unimportant country thought of any aspect
                    of the United States of America, the world's most powerful and successful
                    nation-state? Why should I, introduced as an official representative of my
                    country, be put in the position of having to listen to this old nobody criticize
                    us? The whole situation seemed to me both nonsensical and humiliating.</p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>Fortunately, the old Prince misunderstood the question, and began to talk about
                    how improper it was for Christian countries to send missionaries to Islamic
                    countries which already had their traditional established religion. We parted
                    politely after some aimless chatter, but inwardly I was boiling. Later on I
                    brought up the subject with Ronald, and threshed it out with him. You are
                    undervaluing your country, I told him. Forget about ancient royalties and focus
                    on the power realities of the postwar world. Ronald was quite taken aback. He
                    had been pleased, he said, when Mohammed Ali, heir to the throne of Egypt, had
                    dropped in for a friendly chat. He wanted me to see on what friendly terms he
                    was with the royal family, and had not realized that he would embarrass me.
                    Ronald was essentially a talented officer, and in his later career did well,
                    advancing to ambassadorial rank. But in 1945 he had not yet learned that after
                    World War II we were living in a different world, with new social and political
                    values.</p>
                <p>After several weeks in Cairo, during which my education was advanced
                    considerably, I took another week to visit Beirut, Damascus, and Jerusalem — two
                    legations and a consulate general. (In 1945 the Foreign Service had Ministers
                    rather than ambassadors in the smaller countries. The diplomatic missions headed
                    by Ministers Plenipotentiary, including Cairo, were called legations.) I found
                    bright young officers in all three places and was particularly taken with the
                    30-year-old charg� d'affaires in Damascus, a rather fiery young man who was not
                    at all loath to assert himself and who seemed very much on top of his job. I
                    liked him far better than I did some of the older men I met in the Middle East,
                    who felt that the British had a strong traditional policy in the area, while
                    ours was weak and uncertain. This young officer, whose name was William J.
                    Porter, was to advance to ambassadorial rank and represent our country
                    effectively at several US embassies.</p>
                <p>It was while I was touring Lebanon, Syria, and Palestine that I first encountered
                    the Zionist question and the beginnings of the Jewish-Arab conflict which has
                    been a major problem for the United States for the last forty years. The word
                    had come over the wires that President Truman had made a public pronouncement
                    favoring unrestricted Jewish immigration into Palestine, then a dependent area
                    ruled by the British under a League of Nations mandate. There were about 500,000
                    Jews living in Palestine in 1945, I was told, but it was still an Arab country
                    and the Arab leaders were reported to feel that to admit any more Jews would be
                    a tragic mistake, sure to lead to future trouble and turmoil. It was mostly with
                    Americans in the area that I discussed this development, and I found them deeply
                    worried lest encouraging Jewish immigration would wreck all dreams of future
                    good relations with the Arab world.</p>
                <p>My general impression of the populations of Lebanon, Syria, and Palestine was
                    that they were far more progressive than the Egyptians appeared to be, and had a
                    noticeably higher standard of living. I did not see only the cities of Beirut,
                    Damascus, and Jerusalem, but traveled between them in American legation cars and
                    had ample opportunity to observe small towns, villages, and agricultural life.
                    People everywhere appeared busy and cheerful, and as we passed through villages
                    with our American flag flying, children would run beside us shouting at us
                    happily, and we would toot at them in a merry return greeting.</p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>Back in Cairo the first week in December, I said goodbye to all my new Foreign
                    Service friends and departed by Army Transport Command plane for London. My
                    feeling on leaving the Middle East was that my visit there, lasting five weeks,
                    had been one of the great travel experiences of my life. I had never before
                    visited such exotic countries or seen such fascinating sights. The work of the
                    Foreign Service was much more diverse than in Latin America, and the problems
                    more challenging. There was economic promise in the area, largely because of oil
                    resources and prospects, but there was political ferment and uncertainty.
                    Training personnel for duty in this area was going to be a complicated task,
                    involving much instruction in Arabic and other languages and intense study of
                    cultural and political factors.</p>
                <p>Studying the London Embassy</p>
                <p>Having carefully kept the London Embassy informed on my travel plans by letters
                    and telegrams addressed to Ambassador John Gilbert Winant, I was a bit baffled
                    on arriving in London to find that no one in the administrative section was
                    expecting me, or indeed had ever heard of me. I had some difficulty convincing
                    the old-line FSO who was serving as Administrative Officer that my mission was a
                    serious and official one. Shown my credentials, he reluctantly arranged lodging
                    for me in a Piccadilly hotel, grumbling that the Department should be concerned
                    about fundamentals — by which he meant better pay and allowances — instead of
                    such frills as advanced and specialized in-service training. But next day when I
                    walked into his office, his attitude was entirely different. The Ambassador, it
                    seemed, was interested in me and wanted to see me immediately. It was when I was
                    ushered into Winant's presence that I got the answer to my bewilderment. He was
                    carrying all my letters to him in his pocket, and apparently had not shown them
                    to anyone! One other person, I learned later, knew about me. This was Waldemar
                    Gallman, Counselor of Embassy for Political Affairs. And dear old Waldy,
                    destined to become a good friend of mine, had the impression from Winant that my
                    visit was an entirely personal one, of interest only to the Ambassador
                    himself.</p>
                <p>Eventually, however, we got the whole business sorted out, and word was passed
                    around for everyone to cooperate with my mission. The London Embassy was a large
                    and sprawling one, and I was soon hard at work interviewing officers in the
                    political, economic, commercial, consular, and administrative sections. The
                    political and economic sections were busy and important and both were staffed by
                    senior officers at the first secretary of embassy level. The reason soon became
                    clear. Whereas most embassies and legations were concerned with the affairs of
                    the host country itself, the London Embassy was an interface for cooperation of
                    the two English-speaking allies, Britain and the United States. Each member of
                    the Embassy staff was working with Foreign Office counterparts on international
                    problems of common interest to both countries.</p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>It was only when I talked to the Minister-Counselor for Economic Affairs, the
                    distinguished Harry C. Hawkins who had been for many years a personal assistant
                    to Secretary of State Cordell Hull on negotiating reciprocal trade agreements,
                    that I learned of a peculiarly British problem. It seemed that the British had
                    been caught flat-footed the preceding August when the White House had abruptly
                    canceled the Lend-Lease Program after the Japanese surrender. After straining
                    every nerve and exhausting every resource to carry on the war against the Axis
                    powers, the British were suddenly on the verge of bankruptcy. In this emergency,
                    Hawkins had leapt into the breach. Hurrying to Washington he conferred with
                    leaders in the State Department and the Congress. So much fuss was raised that
                    something had to be done. The Administration by this time had second thoughts.
                    Hawkins and others developed a program for a $3,300,000,000 loan to Britain.
                    Hawkins helped to shepherd this proposal through Congress where he had many
                    friends and was highly esteemed. Altogether, conferring alternately with the
                    British and Americans, Hawkins had made 14 flights across the Atlantic in a
                    three months period. It was an impressive demonstration of one man's personal
                    effectiveness. I was fascinated to hear this story. Little did I foresee at the
                    time that Harry Hawkins would later on be my chief in the Foreign Service
                    Institute, and that I would become one of his most devoted subordinates.</p>
                <p>An Interview with Ambassador Winant</p>
                <p>When I was first introduced to Ambassador Winant, he suggested that I come back
                    during Christmas week when he would have more time to talk. I followed through
                    on this suggestion and made a 2 p.m. appointment to see him on December 27. It
                    turned out to be an extraordinary experience. Winant waved me to a seat and then
                    kept me for nearly three hours, telling me in the greatest detail about his
                    career and how he had conducted himself since his arrival in Britain four years
                    earlier. As the American Ambassador during the critical days of the German
                    victories in Europe and bombings of London, it was Winant's role to reassure the
                    British government and people regarding American sympathy and support.
                    Originally from New Hampshire, where he had served as Governor, Winant had been
                    appointed by President Roosevelt to be the first chairman of the Social Security
                    Board, a top-level New Deal position. He replaced Joseph P. Kennedy as
                    Ambassador in London at a period when Kennedy was exceedingly pessimistic as to
                    Britain's chances of survival. The British were delighted to get a more
                    optimistic and sympathetic representative of the United States. Winant was a
                    tall, gaunt, Lincolnesque figure, famous for many things — for his high idealism
                    on social issues, for his fumbling shyness when asked to make a public speech,
                    for his absent-mindedness and complete inability to remember names of his staff
                    and even of his close relatives, and for his enormous kindliness to everyone
                    whose problems came to his attention. His shyness and bumbling manner in no way
                    annoyed the British, who interpreted his personality as one that was endearing
                    through its obvious sincerity. So he had become fantastically popular with
                    people all through the country.</p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>In talking to me, Winant described to me what he had accomplished in promoting
                    British-American friendships, how he had conceived his role as American
                    Ambassador in wartime, and how he had acted as the principal liaison between top
                    American and top British governmental leaders and military commanders. He was
                    particularly explicit about his role as a conduit between Franklin Roosevelt and
                    Winston Churchill, and displayed great pride in the close intimacy which he had
                    developed with Churchill and Foreign Minister Anthony Eden. When Eden's son was
                    killed in battle, Winant said with emotion that it was he, Winant, to whom Eden
                    had first turned for understanding of his paternal grief.</p>
                <p>I was quite bewildered at first by Winant's outpouring of personal information,
                    but after a while I sensed that he was reliving with me the glory days of the
                    Roosevelt-Churchill era. Because I was from Washington as a representative of
                    the State Department, he must have attributed to me an entirely unmerited
                    importance and influence, as though he expected me to go back and tell the
                    American people everything that he had accomplished. All I had expected from
                    this interview was a half hour of helpful interest in my survey of the Foreign
                    Service, yet whenever I rose to my feet to leave, he would order me to sit down
                    again, as he had much more to tell me. “NO, no — don't go yet — I want you to
                    get the whole picture,” he would say. “There are a lot more things I need to
                    explain to you.” His secretary would interrupt from time to time to give him
                    some message, but each time he would wave her away impatiently. In the end, I
                    spent the entire afternoon with him.</p>
                <p>I never saw Winant again after that one interview, but all through the Embassy I
                    picked up fascinating stories about him. The general opinion among his senior
                    officers was that Winant dramatized himself as one of the great heroes of World
                    War II for the role he had played in cementing the British-American alliance and
                    making it effective. He may even have thought of himself as the natural
                    successor to Roosevelt. Sometime the following year he resigned and returned to
                    the United States, but instead of being hailed as one of the great architects of
                    Allied victory, he found himself virtually unnoticed by the U.S. press and
                    public. So quickly does glory vanish, blown away by the fresh winds of history.
                    I was saddened to read of his death not many months after his retirement from
                    his ambassadorial post. Perhaps the sudden collapse of his self-image was an
                    intolerable humiliation to this proud and sensitive man.</p>
                <p>Impressions of Postwar Britain</p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>In studying the London Embassy, what astonished me most was how fractionated and
                    compartmentalized it seemed to be. Not only were the political and economic
                    sections uncoordinated, but the consular section seemed to be floating loose in
                    the air and there were quite a few individuals around with specialized jobs who
                    did not seem to be reporting to any local superior, but only to offices in
                    Washington. The Administrative Officer left administration largely to British
                    local employees, who used their own judgment and ingenuity, sometimes with
                    strange results. Although Winant made no attempt to run the Embassy, he had one
                    inviolable rule; no telegram to Washington could be sent without his personal
                    approval, and if it contained any sentence reflecting adversely on the Embassy,
                    he would eliminate it.</p>
                <p>In short, the London Embassy was disorganized in many ways, and administered
                    erratically. Officer after officer complained to me how difficult it was to get
                    policy guidance and decision. In the British Foreign Office, I was told, every
                    official was familiar with Cabinet policy, and could make instant decisions on
                    almost any issue without clearing with superiors. But American policy was
                    unclear on a long list of issues, and no one had authority to decide anything or
                    plan anything ahead, a situation which resulted in crises almost daily. The one
                    bright spot was Harry Hawkins, who had been brilliant, it seem to me, in the way
                    he had handled Britain's postwar economic emergency. But in general, lines of
                    authority were a crazy quilt of conflicting powers, important jobs were not
                    being done, communication within the Embassy and with Washington was deficient,
                    and I was indescribably appalled by the lack of progress being made to help
                    organize the postwar world.</p>
                <p>And yet I was impressed by the intelligence and ability of individual officers,
                    six of whom later were promoted to ambassadorial posts. I presume that the
                    Embassy somehow got most of its work done, but assuredly not very
                    efficiently.</p>
                <p>My time in Britain was not exclusively spent in London. A first secretary of
                    embassy and I teamed together on a trip in his car over New Year's to visit the
                    consulates in Manchester and Birmingham and inspect some British industrial
                    plants. With my wartime experiences in industry, I was particularly keen to do
                    this, and found what I observed most meaningful. My companion, the later
                    architect of the NATO alliance, Theodore C. Achilles, was kind enough also to
                    let me do a little sightseeing, visiting Oxford, “that sweet city with its
                    dreaming spires,” and wandering around some of the more famous colleges,
                    including Christ Church where my Columbia M.A. subject, Lewis Carroll, had once
                    lived.</p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>December of 1945 was a gloomy time in England. The shooting war was over, and yet
                    normal conditions had not yet returned. Some 75,000 British war brides of
                    American servicemen who had been stationed in Britain in the years before the
                    Normandy landings on D-Day were about to take off for the United States, and
                    were regarded with envy by many others whose relationships had lapsed — in some
                    cases leaving a pregnant British girl to confront as best she could the prospect
                    of bearing an illegitimate baby. I saw such cases at the consulates, and the
                    experience for me was saddening, for I found the British people remarkably
                    appealing. It was then that I first heard the famous remark about American
                    servicemen, that they were “overpaid, overfed, oversexed, and worst of all, over
                    here!”</p>
                <p>Several evenings in London I had delightful contacts in local pubs where I could
                    sip drinks with the people around me and get into social conversations. There
                    was much camaraderie in such places, which sometimes involved group singing of
                    British and American popular songs. But Britain was tired and almost bankrupt;
                    there was a great feeling of let-down and bewilderment as to what the future
                    offered. One night in a pub on Fleet Street some Embassy friends and I had this
                    feeling brought home to us by a middle-aged employee of one of the news
                    services. Finding out who we were, he began after a few drinks to plead with us.
                    Britain and America were allies, he said, and had fought side by side to win a
                    great war, sharing the burdens as loyal comrades. Now that the war was over,
                    were we no longer allies? Was the USA planning to withdraw to its own rich
                    continent and leave poor old Britain to shift for herself in the bleak European
                    world? The British had accepted American leadership in the fighting, and admired
                    General Eisenhower enormously for his diplomatic and military gifts. But what
                    now? Was Britain to be left in the lurch, weak and exhausted? Were our two
                    nations not friends, and do friends not stand by one another, loyal to the end?
                    Did sentiment mean nothing to Americans? It was all very emotional, stimulated
                    by alcohol, but nevertheless memorable and quite moving. In vino veritas. This
                    was postwar Britain, gloomy and apprehensive. I had my first glimpse of what it
                    was like to be British at mid-century, belonging to a great nation with a
                    magnificent past but a highly uncertain future.</p>
                <p>A Final Anecdote</p>
                <p>In early January I moved on to Belgium, Holland, and France, where I had further
                    educational experiences. But before leaving Britain, let me return to John
                    Gilbert Winant and the infinity of amusing stories about him. Out of gloomy
                    postwar Britain perhaps one lighthearted story should be told.</p>
                <p>The subject of my tale was a young administrative assistant whom I shall call
                    Lincoln Todd. Lincoln was a “good old boy” and every one in the Embassy liked
                    him. But unfortunately he could not control his appetite for alcoholic beverages
                    and was so often incapacitated that the Administrative Officer decided to ask
                    Washington for a replacement. When the necessary telegram was routed to the
                    Ambassador for approval, Winant's eagle eye detected something amiss.</p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>“What are we doing?” he asked apprehensively. “What's the problem?”</p>
                <p>The situation was explained. Lincoln was such an alcoholic he couldn't get his
                    work done.</p>
                <p>“But we mustn't send this poor fellow home!” the Ambassador exclaimed. “It may
                    hurt his career. We must take care of him ourselves and rehabilitate him.”</p>
                <p>The Administrative Officer argued that there was little hope for a successful
                    cure; and anyway he couldn't think of any way to employ Lincoln usefully.</p>
                <p>“Put him in my outer office,” Winant proposed. “Let him draft answers to some of
                    the fan mail I'm getting from the people of Britain”</p>
                <p>So Lincoln Todd was put into a small office in the Ambassador's suite and given a
                    stack of mail to start on. In mid-morning the Administrative Officer came in to
                    see how well he was doing. No one had been in to check on young Todd, but
                    through the closed door could be heard the rustling sound of papers being
                    shuffled.</p>
                <p>“It really seems to be working,” Winant's secretary said. “Maybe we've found
                    something Link can be helpful at.”</p>
                <p>“Let's not jump to conclusions,” said the Administrative Officer. “I'm going in
                    to make a check.” And he opened the door.</p>
                <p>There was a long table in Lincoln's office, and all along its length letters and
                    papers were scattered. There was a chair tilted back against the wall, and in it
                    sat Lincoln Todd, snoring peacefully. In his hand, with a loop around his wrist,
                    he held one end of a piece of string. The other end was attached loosely to one
                    of Link's more imaginative acquisitions, a black-and-white Muscovy duck. Walking
                    up and dawn the table over the scattered papers, the duck was making that
                    rustling sound that sounded so realistic from the office next door!</p>
                <p>Brussels and the Hague</p>
                <p>To save space I shall skip over my impressions of a week spent in Belgium,
                    interviewing the staff of the Brussels Embassy and the Antwerp Consulate
                    General, and move on. Conditions were reasonably good in Belgium, I was told,
                    even so soon after the end of the war. Thrifty and alert, the Belgians had
                    enough food and fuel, and had their factories and export businesses once more in
                    operation. But up in the Netherlands, the Dutch had suffered much more under the
                    German occupation. They could eat tulip bulbs, but had very little grain.
                    Conditions were austere.</p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>I learned in Brussels that every Friday there was a courier trip from Paris up to
                    Rotterdam and The Hague; if I wanted to see the country myself, I could ride up
                    with the courier, returning the same day. I had made no arrangements to visit
                    our posts in Holland, but thought even a brief glimpse would be useful. Up early
                    Friday morning, I got into a Ford station wagon with the courier — a Marine
                    Lieutenant. After a brief stop at Antwerp to drop off classified pouches, we
                    crossed the Dutch frontier, passed through Breda and Dordrecht, and headed for
                    Rotterdam. There were burned-out tanks and other military vehicles scattered all
                    along the side of the highway, and we crossed the two branches of the Lower
                    Rhine on pontoon bridges, the permanent structures having been destroyed during
                    the war. The Dutch people we saw in villages and towns looked cold and shabby,
                    but the courier kept telling me how much better they looked than on his last
                    visit two months before, when every one was queued up for Allied military
                    rations.</p>
                <p>In Rotterdam we found the entire consular staff huddled for lunch around a stove
                    in the one heated room. The Consul had gone to the U.S. Army mess in The Hague
                    to eat, and we pressed on to the embassy at The Hague after visiting the mess
                    ourselves. While the courier was busy exchanging pouches in the file room, I
                    dropped in on the Administrative Officer, George Haering, a 50-year-old FSO who
                    had come over recently from London. There he had been assigned to the staff of
                    Dr. Stanley Hornbeck, Ambassador to the Netherlands Government in Exile; and
                    with the rest of the staff had now arrived to take up residence in liberated
                    Holland. The Embassy did not have a separate structure, but occupied two floors
                    of a Dutch office building.</p>
                <p>Chatting with Haering, I soon established who I was and why I was there. Almost
                    immediately he suggested my paying a call on Ambassador Hornbeck. At first I
                    demurred, saying I had no business to transact with anyone, but was only
                    sightseeing. That story wouldn't work, Haering told me, for if Hornbeck
                    discovered that a visitor from the Department had not personally called on him,
                    he would be put in such a rage that everyone would suffer. Reluctantly I agreed
                    to make a quick call on the Ambassador, but only pro forma. After a brief wait
                    while Haering explained me to Hornbeck, I was ushered into a chilly office where
                    an elderly man with thin wisps of white hair was sitting at a large desk with
                    his overcoat on. I was later to learn that Stanley Hornbeck, then in his late
                    sixties, had been for many years the Department's top man on Far East affairs.
                    Rigid and dictatorial, he had been eased out of that position and given the
                    Netherlands ambassadorship as a reward for his long career in the
                    Department.</p>
                <p>Hornbeck waved me to a chair and came straight to the point.</p>
                <p>“What is the purpose of your visit, Mr. Hopkins?”</p>
                <p>I explained as best I could that I was on an orientation tour and was studying
                    Foreign Service problems, preparatory to making plans for a postwar in-service
                    training program. How long would I be in The Hague? the Ambassador asked in a
                    steely, insistent voice.</p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>“No time at all, Mr. Ambassador. I just rode up with the courier to see the
                    country. He is waiting for me now.”</p>
                <p>“And how long are you staying in Brussels?”</p>
                <p>“Just a week, sir. I'm on m way to Paris.” I could sense that I was getting into
                    trouble with this fretful old gentleman.</p>
                <p>“One week in Brussels and only a few minutes in The Hague? Mr. Hopkins, who
                    worked out this absurd division of time? Does the Department think we have no
                    problems in The Hague?”</p>
                <p>The courier would be loading his pouches by now and waiting for me impatiently.
                    And I could see that it was not going to be easy to make a courteous exit. The
                    Ambassador was boring into me with a gimlet eye and was in no mood to let me
                    escape. I had to do something to pacify him, so I offered to take back to
                    Washington any messages he might want to entrust to me.</p>
                <p>“Certainly I have a message to send.” He buzzed for his secretary. “Miss Smith,
                    bring me that list of unanswered telegrams .... Now, Mr. Hopkins, just pull your
                    chair over by mine and read this paper with me. Can you see? In September, three
                    telegrams. In October, five, in November, seven. In December, twelve.” His voice
                    rose to a crescendo. “In toto, twenty-seven unanswered telegrams. Mr. Hopkins,
                    why — why — WHY doesn't the Department of State answer my telegrams?”</p>
                <p>Two days later the Ambassador's anguished words were still ringing in my ears as
                    I boarded the train at Brussels for Paris.</p>
                <p>A Glimpse of Postwar Europe in 1946</p>
                <p>Paris in the Postwar Gloom</p>
                <p>All along the railroad line from Brussels to Paris I could see signs of war
                    damage. Burned out and abandoned military vehicles were strewed everywhere.
                    Several railroad stations had their roofs open to the sky, and damaged buildings
                    could be seen in every town we passed through. A Dutch couple who lived in
                    Barcelona shared my railway compartment; they were on their way back to Spain
                    after having spent the Christmas holidays with relatives in Amsterdam, their
                    first trip to their own country since the war. They were burning with anger
                    against the Germans for all the suffering they had caused the Dutch people
                    during the harsh Nazi occupation.</p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>At the Gare du Nord a car from the Paris Embassy met me and took me to the Hotel
                    Crillon, next door to the Embassy on the Place de la Concorde. This famous
                    hostelry, so elegant before the war, had been taken over by the American
                    military establishment. It looked down at the heels, but with American fuel it
                    was pleasantly warm, one of the few adequately heated buildings in Paris that
                    chilly January. Bewildered French chefs and waiters were trying to serve food
                    from the American commissary in an ornate dining room where magnificent French
                    meals had been served in peacetime to gourmet guests. A worse failure at
                    preparing American dishes palatably I hope never again to experience. A bunch of
                    mountaineers from Macedonia would have done a better job.</p>
                <p>I woke up my first morning to the sound of pedestrians clop-clopping along in the
                    street beneath my bedroom window. I learned later that they were wearing wooden
                    soles and heels, for good leather footwear had become unobtainable during the
                    German occupation and these noisy shoes were the French makeshift. When I got
                    out on the streets myself to renew my acquaintance with the glamorous Paris I
                    had once known, people were wearing shabby clothing but somehow still looking
                    neat, especially the chic Parisian women. Stores were open and business was
                    being conducted, but all buildings were chilly for lack of heating fuel, which
                    was scarcer than in Belgium.</p>
                <p>On the Rue de la Paix, I saw the Stars and Stripes displayed, and looked in on an
                    American library and periodical reading room. Every chair at every table was
                    occupied by intellectual-appearing men in overcoats. I chatted with the
                    librarian, to find out what they were reading so avidly. She told me that almost
                    all visitors were French professional men who were poring avidly over American
                    technical journals and trying to catch up with what was going on in their
                    various professions. For years they had been cut off by enemy occupation from
                    the Anglo-American world, and now they were trying desperately to re-enter that
                    world and inform themselves on the newest ideas and accomplishments.</p>
                <p>Paris was cold and the Parisian people seemed gloomy and dispirited. It was while
                    I was there that first month of 1946 that General Charles de Gaulle, whom I was
                    later to meet and interview in the French West Indies in 1960, resigned as
                    French premier. He had taken over power in France after the Allied liberation in
                    1944, but had become disgusted with the general disorder and lack of cooperation
                    he encountered everywhere, much of it deliberately fomented by the French
                    Communist party. As all the world knows, he retired to Colombey-les-Deux-Eglises
                    and wrote books in the solitude of his study until he was called back to power
                    in the Algerian crisis of 1958. I can still remember the pithy headline I saw on
                    a Paris newspaper the day of the resignation: De Gaulle s'en va; le crise
                    reste.” The liberator had stepped aside, but what good did that do when France
                    was in a postwar crisis, cold, wet, miserable, and hungry?</p>
                <p>Inside the American Embassy</p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>The Administrative Officer of the American Embassy, a cheerful, bouncy young
                    officer of my age whose name was Tyler Thompson, greeted me cordially. The Paris
                    Embassy was organized quite differently from the others I had visited; in fact,
                    each embassy or legation or consulate that I visited seemed to be organized
                    differently from all the others. The Paris Embassy was not so tightly
                    administered as the one at Mexico City, but was a vast improvement over London.
                    Thompson, a Princeton graduate of 1930, seemed to have a good grasp of all that
                    was going on. He reported to a much older officer, Hugh Fullerton, who had the
                    titles of Counselor of Embassy and Consul General. Fullerton was officially the
                    Embassy's number two officer, but had no control over the political section
                    because Jefferson Caffery, the experienced Ambassador, preferred to supervise
                    all political functions himself. There was a large economic section headed by
                    Livingston Merchant, Counselor of Embassy for Economic Affairs with the
                    personnel rank of Minister. Merchant had come to the Department of State after
                    working many years for a Wall Street investment firm. Some of the old-line FSOs
                    resented his appointment to such a high rank and desirable post, but everyone
                    who worked for him liked him enormously. Paris was grim that winter, but the
                    economic officers all told me that Livy Merchant was such a splendid boss that
                    he made their sufferings worthwhile by the quality of his leadership. He was to
                    hold several high offices later in his career, including Assistant Secretary of
                    State for European Affairs and Ambassador to Canada.</p>
                <p>Fullerton and Thompson seemed to have the administrative problems of the large
                    embassy well under control, but had a heavy workload and many difficulties
                    because of the logistical problems in a great city that was impoverished and
                    miserable. It was hard to say which section of the Embassy was busiest. Our
                    political officers worked seven days a week following the tangled political
                    situation, greatly complicated by the prestige which the French Communists had
                    won by their active participation in the underground resistance during the war.
                    The economic officers, confronted daily with further breakdowns in the
                    precarious French economy, were madly typing or dictating long despatches to
                    Washington, describing all the deficiencies. In the consular section there were
                    long lines of ragged people, extending well out into the street alongside the
                    building, all seeking somehow to get to America, the golden land where they
                    hoped to escape their miseries. There was also a considerable line of people in
                    the passport and citizenship section. These, I was told, were American citizens
                    resident in Europe who were trying to validate their citizenship so that they
                    could go home. Many were German-Americans who had collaborated happily for years
                    with the Nazis in Germany, then had come rushing over to Paris after Hitler's
                    collapse. The Foreign Service was ready for this kind of fair-weather American.
                    The entire staff of the former Berlin citizenship section was on duty in Paris,
                    with all their Berlin records intact. It was easy to identify the collaborators.
                    They were told that they could have passports valid only for the trip home, but
                    that the Federal Bureau of Investigation would be waiting to accost them as they
                    walked down the gangplank and landed on U.S. territory. Doubtless many chose not
                    to leave Europe after all.</p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>Through the good offices of Messrs. Fullerton and Thompson, I was taken fairly
                    soon to the Ambassador's suite and presented to Mr. Caffery. He was affable,
                    took an interest in my mission, and made a number of comments. One of them was
                    that he was not much impressed with the quality of most career officers that he
                    knew; they seem to him lacking in political astuteness. He himself had been a
                    Chief of Mission for two decades, handling a long series of difficult
                    assignments. He doubted that many of the officers younger than himself were of
                    Chief of Mission calibre, and at Paris thought it best to do without a Political
                    Counselor of Embassy, running the political section himself.</p>
                <p>Remembering that Selden Chapin, my boss in the State Department, had once worked
                    under Caffery in Paris, I took occasion one day after my return to Washington to
                    ask Selden what his opinion was of Jefferson Caffery and what it had been like
                    to work under him. Chapin promptly responded that Caffery was a difficult
                    egotist. He was able and experienced, but he kept much valuable information to
                    himself, refusing to share with his staff what he learned from his high-level
                    contacts in the French Government. This secretiveness of the Ambassador made it
                    difficult for his political officers to write reports and despatches which were
                    sufficiently knowledgeable or perceptive to make a good impression in
                    Washington. Caffery regarded himself as working directly for President
                    Roosevelt, and I was told that he did not always let even the Department of
                    State share what he learned about conditions in France.</p>
                <p>Personally I was well treated by Caffery. He asked me to attend his staff
                    meetings, along with his various counselors and military and naval attach�s, and
                    here I learned in what a dreadful state of weakness and confusion the French
                    people were living. The economy was depressed; morale was poor among industrial
                    employees; the Army, what there was of it, was poorly equipped, supplied and
                    led; the Navy was practically non-existent; there was little political unity or
                    governmental effectiveness. France was liberated and alive, but progress was
                    painfully slow.</p>
                <p>About this same time I was allowed to sit in and observe a regional conference in
                    the Paris Embassy of our senior Foreign Service economic officers from all over
                    Europe. The meeting was to promote the exchange of information on the various
                    countries and to arrive at a composite picture of how much recovery there had
                    been in the European economy since hostilities had ceased the preceding May. I
                    could have filled several notebooks with all the depressing reports. The German
                    economy, in the heart of Europe, was virtually paralyzed. Traffic was at a
                    standstill on the Rhine, the Danube, and other inland waterways. Railroads were
                    barely able to operate with fuel in short supply, rolling stock damaged, and
                    tracks blocked in many places. Our man from Prague said that the Czechs urgently
                    needed Polish coal for their industries, to which our man from Warsaw said the
                    Poles would have to send up their own empty cars. Certainly not, the other
                    replied, for how could the Czechs be sure that any rolling stock allowed out of
                    Czechoslovakia would ever come back to them? And so it went. There was gloom and
                    distrust everywhere.</p>
                <p>Budgeting for Postwar Conditions</p>
                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>All during my weeks in Paris I was busy with my interviewing, learning every day
                    hundreds of valuable facts about the Foreign Service and its people. I saw a
                    good deal of my friends in the Administrative Office. One day Tyler Thompson
                    called me in to show me in consternation a proposed 1947 budget which had just
                    arrived from the State Department for review and comment. This budget would have
                    cut back on Paris consular and administrative personnel, would have reduced the
                    size of the economic staff by more than a third, and on the other hand would
                    have supplied the Embassy with a batch of new commercial officers who would
                    presumably, now that the war was over, rush out and promote the sale of American
                    exports on the recovering European market. A more unrealistic document, more out
                    of harmony with the precarious state of the European economy, would have been
                    hard to imagine. I knew exactly who had drafted this absurd piece of nonsense —
                    a staff of old-line Department of Commerce people with mostly Latin American
                    trade experience. They were newcomers in the Office of the Foreign Service. I
                    had already talked to some of these people in Washington and had been appalled
                    by their unawareness of world conditions. I doubted that what they had put on
                    paper had been shown to Chapin and Steyne, who would have realized instantly how
                    out of touch it was with grim realities.</p>
                <p>I lay awake hours that night, wondering how I could best help my Paris friends
                    ward off budgetary disaster. I decided that I would write Chapin a truly
                    imaginative essay on the kind of Foreign Service budget suited for postwar
                    conditions. Next day I sat at my typewriter for hours, banging out a memo of
                    more than 20 pages. I no longer have a copy of this document, but it was a
                    humdinger. The Department's whole approach on the budget issue was a grisly
                    mistake, I wrote. There should be no picayune haggling over budgetary details,
                    but instead a Department of State request to the White House, the Bureau of the
                    Budget, and the Congress which would ask for such a huge sum of money that it
                    would stagger the American people. We needed to launch a national debate on what
                    to do about the economic devastation that existed in the wake of the greatest
                    military conflict ever waged on the planet Earth. Several hundred million
                    dollars would be needed to build up an adequate postwar U.S. Foreign Service.
                    Far vaster sums, mounting into the billions, would be needed in postwar Europe
                    and other critical areas to help our wartime allies and other friendly nations
                    get back on their feet.</p>
                <p>The details of such a budget, I wrote Chapin, would be far less important than
                    the sheer breath-taking size of our request for funds. We needed to thrust the
                    Department of State so aggressively into the limelight of national attention
                    that official Washington could not evade the issues we were raising. We would
                    show the country that the State Department was staffed with imaginative people
                    and had a realistic grasp of the postwar world. This was no time to follow the
                    usual procedure of going to the President and the Congress, hat in hand, to ask
                    for piddling sums.</p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>My main idea was that we needed the shock effect of doing something completely
                    unexpected. Only a dramatically enormous budget request, ten or twenty times
                    what we had had before, would do the trick. In the meantime, I told Chapin, the
                    European portion of the document his people drafted was so stupid it was
                    downright disgraceful. With Europe on the brink of despair, it was incredible
                    that anyone should think in terms of promoting American exports, for the
                    Europeans had no money. Why not fire the entire budget staff and start over
                    again with some people who knew what the postwar world was like?</p>
                <p>Fullerton and Thompson were a little dazzled by the sweep and forthrightness of
                    my proposal, but did not object to it. Let it go in, they said, and maybe it
                    will wake up some Washington bureaucrats who are living in a dream world. Chapin
                    never answered my memo in writing, but when I got back to Washington, he told me
                    that he had read it with a feeling of mounting excitement. With my memo in hand,
                    he said, he had charged down the hall to the office of Donald Russell, Assistant
                    Secretary of State for Administration, slammed it down on his desk, and said
                    “Don, you've got to read this! It has some damned important ideas in it.”</p>
                <p>But Russell was not to be moved. He was a South Carolina lawyer with no
                    experience in Washington who owed his job to the fact that he was a junior law
                    partner of Secretary of State James F. Byrnes, a politician who felt that he
                    must surround himself with personal friends in whom he had confidence. Byrnes
                    once wrote that nothing in his career as a South Carolina small-town lawyer had
                    prepared him to deal with the Soviet leaders. He might have added that nothing
                    in Russell's career had prepared him for any international problems at all. He
                    made little impact in Washington, and was totally forgotten as soon as Byrnes
                    and he departed.</p>
                <p>But aside from Russell, the other people around Chapin were also not audacious
                    enough to accept new ideas and stir up a national issue. Their training was
                    always to think in minimum terms, justifying every budget item with minute care.
                    In that atmosphere, what chance did my proposal have? Chapin was excited
                    momentarily, but soon the whole memo was forgotten. However, it may have had
                    some effect as one of many unfavorable reactions to that first insane budget
                    proposal, for when all the embassies in Europe sent in their outraged responses,
                    the cumulative effect of all our rebuttals resulted in a more sensible final
                    document. And no one in OFS after my return told me I was crazy. I was just
                    regarded as a newcomer to government who hadn't learned the realities. I am
                    reminded of a conversation I once had in the Department's executive lunchroom
                    with an elderly retired gentleman who had once served as Ambassador to a small
                    Asian country.</p>
                <p>“We people who have been around the Department for a long time,” he told me,
                    “have learned to tolerate inexperienced young newcomers like you, who think you
                    can come in here from the outside and change our organization and the way it
                    functions!”</p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>But back to the Paris Embassy, I found it a fitting place to complete my
                    orientation tour of the Foreign Service. After a month there, I was extremely
                    eager to get home and be reunited with my family, and felt that I had
                    accomplished as much as I could at this stage. My orientation had lasted almost
                    six months, and it was time to return to the Department and put my ideas in
                    circulation. My tour had been enormously valuable, I felt, for I came home with
                    a good working knowledge of our embassies, legations, and consulates. I had
                    formally visited altogether five posts in Mexico and Cuba, one in Canada, four
                    in the Middle East, three in Britain, two in Belgium, and finally one (Paris) in
                    France. I had notes on several hundred employees whom I had interviewed, on all
                    levels from ambassadors down to code clerks and secretary-typists. I had talked
                    not only to American employees, but also to some of the local foreigners who
                    worked for us and in many cases were among our most valuable people.</p>
                <p>Ready now to go to work, I reported back to the Department of State in February,
                    bursting with ideas of things that needed to be done to reinvigorate the Foreign
                    Service and equip it for its postwar world. The immediate task was to draft a
                    series of papers incorporating these ideas. Not only did the Foreign Service
                    need to be brought up to date on all that was happening in America and in the
                    wider world, but it had to be completely reoriented and given a much more
                    activist conception of its responsibilities. It had thought before World War II
                    of itself as a listening and responding organization, “the eyes and ears of the
                    United States abroad.” But that was not good enough for the future. The United
                    States was taking a leadership role in organizing the international community
                    for peace. Through the new United Nations and through much more extensive and
                    intimate associations with other nations, men of good will could create a world
                    in which diverse peoples could live together in harmony and brotherhood. It was
                    a time for new planetary thinking, and the people of the Foreign Service must be
                    part of the new thinking and must help to bring about a real transformation in
                    worldwide relationships.</p>
                <p>Working for the Department of State</p>
                <p>Conditions in 1946</p>
                <p>The Department of State when I returned from my foreign tour in 1946 seemed to me
                    a very strange organization, made up of a number of disparate elements which
                    were struggling with each other for power and influence. People in the oldest
                    part of the Department, the so-called geographic offices and divisions, were
                    strongly oriented toward traditional bilateral diplomacy, dealing with foreign
                    governments on a country-by-country basis. They thought of themselves as keeping
                    track of everything that was happening in the various areas of the world,
                    reading the reports of our embassies and legations for their informational value
                    and then in turn providing policy guidance to our missions abroad whenever any
                    situation developed which seemed to require an American action or decision. Some
                    of the officers in the geographic area were Foreign Service officers who were
                    rotated back and forth between Washington and the field posts; others were
                    permanent Civil Service employees, usually with a strongly academic
                    background.</p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>But there was another part of the Department which was quite new, quite dynamic,
                    and quite innovative. It was made up of those thinkers and planners who had
                    worked through the war years drafting the charters for the United Nations and
                    other international agencies. Many of them had not been working in the
                    Department's old building next to the White House on Pennsylvania Avenue, but in
                    a splendid private mansion in Washington's Georgetown section known as Dumbarton
                    Oaks. The United Nations planners were members of a wartime addition to the
                    Department of State known as the Office of Special Political Affairs. This unit
                    was eventually to evolve into the Bureau of International Organization Affairs
                    and to deal with both the United Nations headquarters and with a whole series of
                    international organizations known as the specialized UN agencies. Among these
                    were the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the Food and Agriculture
                    Organization, the UN Organization for Education, Science and Culture (UNESCO),
                    the World Health Organization, the International Labor Office, and the
                    International Civil Aviation Organization.</p>
                <p>Closely allied with the UN planners were the economists in the offices and
                    divisions of the Department dealing with international economic affairs. By 1946
                    these economic offices had already played a role in the important Bretton Woods
                    conference of 1944, and had helped to set up the World Bank and International
                    Monetary Fund (IMF) in 1945. When I arrived on the scene they were heavily
                    involved in planning something to be called the International Trade
                    Organization, which eventually evolved into a consultative arrangement known as
                    GATT, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.</p>
                <p>Economists liked to think globally, arguing that the world economy was a global
                    network and no respector of national boundaries. The global approach made the
                    diplomatic types in the geographic offices very uncomfortable. Each sovereign
                    country, they thought, had to be dealt with directly and individually. They were
                    highly skeptical of all the new talk about multilateral diplomacy. They did not
                    think that all the elaborate new machinery of multinational discussion and
                    consultation would work out to be very effective. And they were quite determined
                    not to surrender any of their traditional roles in American foreign relations.
                    They constituted the political branch of the Department and they argued that
                    international politics was dominated by competing nationalisms and national
                    interests. It was necessary, they insisted, for diplomatic relations to be
                    between governments and to be carried out basically by direct bi-national
                    contacts.</p>
                <p>The struggle between the bilateral and multilateral approaches to American
                    foreign relations was going full tilt in 1946. It lasted throughout my
                    twenty-three years in the Department and I presume that it is still going on.
                    But the multilateralists lost a lot of ground when the Soviet Union began using
                    its veto in the Security Council to protect its own national interests. By
                    refusing to be a part of a cooperative world community and by treating the West
                    as their enemy, the leaders in the Kremlin effectively prevented a lot of the
                    United Nations machinery set up in the 1940's from realizing the dreams of its
                    planners.</p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>But the struggle between multilateral and bilateral forms of diplomacy was only
                    one of many which I found going on in 1946. There was also a constant struggle
                    between the Foreign Service planners with whom I was associated and the leaders
                    of the Civil Service bureaucracy ensconced in what was then called the Bureau of
                    the Budget, and is now OMB, the Office of Management and Budget. The BOB, as I
                    shall call it, thought of itself as the President's executive arm in controlling
                    the entire executive branch of the Federal Government. The BOB people in 1946
                    did not want the Foreign Service to have its own separate personnel system,
                    organized like the Army and the Navy in a hierarchical manner. They thought that
                    Foreign Service posts should be staffed by the Civil Service. They argued for
                    standardization of all Government personnel systems and complete equality of the
                    Foreign Service with the rest of the Federal bureaucracy.</p>
                <p>The guiding principle of the Foreign Service, however, was that diplomacy was a
                    profession requiring outstanding individuals who were specially trained in
                    foreign languages, cultures, histories, governments, political customs, and so
                    on. These outstanding individuals could be recruited through competitive
                    examinations and offered the excitement and glamour of careers in diplomacy. The
                    Budget Bureau refused to concede that career diplomats were different from
                    anyone else; put everybody under Civil Service, the Budget people said, and
                    let's get rid of all this snobbish nonsense about intellectual and social
                    distinctions. The Foreign Service planners in Selden Chapin's organization
                    argued back that diplomacy called for a degree of talent and commitment that the
                    Civil Service could not consistently provide. Good people could doubtless be
                    found under Civil Service for the glamour spots, they said, but without a career
                    system, how could talented officers be persuaded to staff hardship posts, remote
                    and disagreeable but nevertheless important to U.S. diplomacy? How could they be
                    motivated to learn difficult foreign languages requiring many years of study?
                    The debate went on endlessly, and I was to find myself right in the middle of it
                    for several years.</p>
                <p>A very pressing problem in 1946 was of an entirely different nature. The
                    Department of State had inherited on January 1 of that year, by one stroke of
                    President Truman's pen, all the temporary wartime agencies which had been
                    recruited in the Roosevelt era. These included the Office of War Information,
                    established to influence wartime world opinion and combat enemy propaganda; the
                    Foreign Economic Administration, which had waged economic warfare against the
                    Axis powers and sought to mobilize the forerunner of the Central Intelligence
                    Agency, which during the war collected intelligence, carried out
                    counterintelligence duties, and performed a wide variety of special secret
                    operations. There were many excellent people in these organizations who were
                    already oriented toward foreign affairs; many of them possessed valuable
                    expertise. It was proposed that the Department should evaluate these
                    organizations and their individual people and decide which functions and
                    personnel it should retain for peacetime duty. The transfer to the State
                    Department brought in thousands of new employees, of whom about 2,000 were
                    already scheduled for release. Another 7,000 or so were hanging on, uncertain of
                    their status, to see what they would be offered by our department.</p>
                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>There were many decisions which urgently needed to be made and could only be made
                    authoritatively by the Secretary of State or by specially empowered
                    subordinates. Someone needed to decide how to fit the new multilateral diplomacy
                    into the Department, what to do about the future of the Foreign Service, how to
                    strengthen and enlarge the Department for all its new responsibilities, and how
                    to structure and orient the entire organization. But where was the Secretary,
                    and what were his wishes?</p>
                <p>The Secretary of State for the first two years of the Truman administration, 1945
                    and 1946, was James F. Byrnes. A former Senator from South Carolina, Byrnes had
                    been a prominent figure in the Roosevelt years. By many accounts he had wanted
                    to be FDR's running mate in the 1944 election, but had lost out to Harry S.
                    Truman. He was not experienced in administrative management, but in law and
                    politics. And he came into office at a time when the United States was deeply
                    involved in negotiations with its wartime allies, especially British, French,
                    and Russians, about how to organize the postwar world. All through his term of
                    office, Byrnes was repeatedly involved in high-level conferences, mostly in
                    Europe, and these not only absorbed his time and energy but left him little time
                    in Washington to deal with internal matters. Deprived of the Secretary's
                    executive supervision the Department drifted indecisively for many months. The
                    situation led to a bon mot of that era which was widely quoted in Washington,
                    “The State Department fiddles while Byrnes roams.” Without leadership at the top
                    to provide unity of thought and action, the various offices pursued their
                    separate goals. The press complained that it could not figure out what the
                    Department stood for in 1946, for it spoke with many voices. One correspondent
                    hit the nail on the head by reporting to his newspaper that the State Department
                    was not a true organization at all, but only “a loose confederation of warring
                    tribes.”</p>
                <p>Involvement in Foreign Service Planning</p>
                <p>It took me several weeks after my return to Washington that February to report to
                    my superiors in OFS all that I had learned in six months of studying the Foreign
                    Service and what my evaluations were as an outsider with a fresh point of view.
                    My notebooks were crammed with day-by-day reports on everything I had seen and
                    heard, and I was not reluctant to summarize my findings. These were both
                    sympathetic and critical. I had taken a great liking to Foreign Service people,
                    whom I found generally attractive, friendly, intelligent, and admirably devoted
                    to their responsibilities. But I deplored the many evidences I had found of weak
                    administration and poor personnel management.</p>
                <p>The conclusions I reported could be paraphrased as follows: “In general the men
                    and women of the Foreign Service are a fine group of people — competent,
                    dedicated, and deeply interested in their work. There are very few members of
                    ethnic minorities and almost all women are clerks and secretaries without
                    officer status. But aside from that, the Service is more broadly representative
                    of the American population than I had expected, recruited from all regions of
                    the United States and from a diversity of economic and educational
                    backgrounds.</p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>“Abilities vary a great deal. We have a respectable number of quite outstanding
                    career officers and a much larger number who are highly competent and do our
                    country much credit. The Service does a great deal of routine work in such
                    fields as visa issuance, protection of American citizens, and promotion of
                    international trade. Those officers who have been assigned for long periods to
                    routine consular duties have had their minds and imaginations dulled, with the
                    result that we have some veteran officers who are useful at what they are doing,
                    but have limited potential for further development. We also have a few seriously
                    deficient officers who should be retired or selected out in the near future.</p>
                <p>“Morale is surprisingly good in spite of the fact that the system of assignments
                    and promotions is not at all equitable. Some officers have been assigned
                    advantageously to challenging duties, have been promoted regularly, and are
                    happy in their careers. Others have been less fortunate and feel frustrated and
                    neglected. While favoritism is a factor in Foreign Service careers, so is blind
                    luck; the course of many careers is determined by chance rather than by
                    systematic personnel management. Many positions in the Service, especially in
                    consular work, require only average ability and are stultifying for officers of
                    high intelligence who hunger for more challenging responsibilities. It is useful
                    to assign young officers to such positions for training early in their careers,
                    but those who demonstrate potential should be rotated systematically to other
                    responsibilities.</p>
                <p>“Many officers with good educational backgrounds struck me as being out of touch
                    with contemporary American life and thought. Their minds and imaginations ought
                    to be stimulated by new academic experiences. Periods of reorientation and
                    advanced training are badly needed.</p>
                <p>“Most of our embassies seem to be poorly organized and administered. Our mission
                    chiefs and other senior officers are frequently not good executives. It is
                    common for them to become so absorbed in their personal duties and activities
                    that they do not provide good supervision to their staffs and do not delegate
                    enough responsibilities to their subordinates. The Department should give a
                    great deal more attention to administration and see that our field posts are
                    better organized and better administered; they are not the well-managed
                    efficient organizations they could and should be in which all duties and
                    responsibilities are carefully defined and well understood.”</p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>Among those with whom I discussed these findings was my Mexico City friend, Carl
                    W. Strom, who was now in Washington. While I was touring Middle Eastern and
                    Western European posts, the director of OFS, Selden Chapin, had brought in a
                    number of new people and strengthened his staff considerably. In charge of the
                    new Division of Foreign Service Planning was a sparkling and imaginative officer
                    by the name of Andrew B. Foster. Strom had been brought in as Foster's senior
                    deputy. His principal responsibility was to head a five-man team which was to
                    draft a comprehensive new charter for the postwar Foreign Service. This new
                    chapter, when enacted into legislation by the Congress, would provide statutory
                    authority for all the changes and improvements which the OFS group had in mind.
                    Strom was an excellent choice to take charge of the drafting work, for he had a
                    comprehensive grasp of the changes needed and an exceptional talent for thinking
                    them through to final details. His team included an experienced lawyer from the
                    Office of the Legal Adviser and three bright younger people with ideas and
                    imagination. One of these was assigned specifically to the section which would
                    provide statutory authority for the proposed new Foreign Service Institute.</p>
                <p>The plan for me was that I was to become an assistant director of the Institute
                    when it was established, and to have specific responsibility for programs of
                    advanced in-service training for middle-grade and senior officers. Since the
                    Institute did not yet exist, I was slotted into a Civil Service position in a
                    unit of OFS called the Division of Training Services and given the title of
                    Assistant Chief. The training division at that stage was busy mostly with
                    providing orientation and basic training to miscellaneous new employees of the
                    Department and Foreign Service. I had few immediate operational duties, so I
                    settled down with a secretary to draft a series of papers in which I proposed
                    plans to improve the effectiveness of the Department's administration of the
                    Foreign Service. In each of my projects I conferred fully with Strom, in whose
                    judgment I had great confidence. In return he kept me fully informed in all that
                    was going on in Foreign Service planning and the drafting of the proposed new
                    legislation.</p>
                <p>One of my early think-pieces was an essay on the organization and administration
                    of embassies, legations, and consulates. (The emphasis was on embassies, for by
                    1946 most of our pre-war legations had been elevated to embassy status.) My
                    essay, which I called “The Embassy of the Future,” proposed a standard
                    organizational pattern for all our embassies. Each embassy, I proposed, should
                    give its informational and cultural staff, its consular activities, and its
                    administrative section the same status as that already enjoyed by its political
                    and economic sections. Each of the five sections should be headed by a chief,
                    with an appropriately high title, but instead of reporting directly to the
                    ambassador the five section chiefs would be supervised by a senior executive
                    officer. This official, to be known as the Deputy Chief of Mission, or DCM,
                    would be responsible to the ambassador for all embassy operations. He would
                    coordinate the work of all five sections and free the ambassador for the
                    diplomatic functions which only an ambassador could perform. He would also
                    substitute for the ambassador in periods of absence or illness and be the
                    ambassador's principal adviser.</p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>As things worked out, my one-one-five plan, as I called it, was officially
                    adopted by the Office of the Foreign Service and gradually implemented in all
                    Foreign Service staffing. It is still the standard organizational plan for U.S.
                    embassies today. The DCM position has come to be regarded as a prestigious one
                    to which all ambitious Foreign Service officers aspire. It is especially
                    important to have such a position, occupied by an experienced career officer,
                    when the ambassador is chosen from outside the career service for political
                    reasons and is not familiar with diplomatic operations. An example of how the
                    system has operated can be taken from the later career of my friend Strom.
                    Appointed to be Deputy Chief of Mission in Korea during the Eisenhower
                    administration, Carl took over responsibility from a politically appointed
                    ambassador during a long period of absence and ran the Seoul embassy as the
                    American charg� d'affaires. In this capacity he showed the Department that he
                    could deal successfully with the Korean chief of state, the difficult Syngman
                    Rhee. Favorably impressed, the Department nominated Carl next to be ambassador
                    to Cambodia, where he dealt with another difficult Asian, Prince Norodom
                    Sihanouk. He had a final foreign assignment as ambassador to Bolivia, a
                    turbulent country with a difficult Andean climate to which we have nearly always
                    sent a career man as ambassador. Naturally enough Carl found that he could focus
                    much better on his ambassadorial responsibilities when he had a capable DCM to
                    run his embassy for him.</p>
                <p>Although I was delighted to find Strom in Washington and to be able to associate
                    with him closely, I was saddened by another development. The brilliant and
                    charming Alan N. Steyne, whom I had liked so much in 1945 and who had been the
                    principal individual responsible for recruiting me, was no longer in OFS. He had
                    suffered a nervous breakdown from a combination of overwork and difficult
                    personal problems. He went to Florida for some weeks to try to recuperate, but
                    returned still in a highly nervous and depressed state. His fianc�e, an
                    attractive young English woman, came over from London to try to comfort him, but
                    one day Alan ended his life with a revolver in the basement of his club — an
                    inexplicable tragedy for a man who had an exceedingly important role to play and
                    a fine career ahead of him.</p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>As spring came in 1946 we began to assemble the staff which would form the
                    nucleus of the planned Foreign Service Institute. As director a splendid man was
                    recruited. He was William P. Maddox, a Harvard Ph. D. and former Rhodes Scholar
                    who had taught international relations at Princeton and Pennsylvania. He had
                    spent the war years in Italy and Britain for the OSS. All in all, Maddox had
                    just the background the position required. We also recruited three
                    well-qualified people who would be assistant directors along with me — Laurence
                    W. Taylor, a fine all-round consular and diplomatic officer whom I had
                    discovered in Montreal and recommended for the position; John B. Whitelaw, a
                    Yale graduate with a background in both teacher training and administrative
                    management; and Henry Lee Smith, Jr., a Princeton Ph. D. whose special field was
                    linguistics and who had already achieved an outstanding reputation for his
                    language work with the Army, employing all the latest methods of foreign
                    language instruction. Taylor was to head up the basic training of new junior
                    officers, indoctrinating them into the Foreign Service; Whitelaw would be in
                    charge of all forms of clerical, fiscal, and administrative training; and
                    Smith's work for the next ten years was to develop a superior instructional
                    staff and superlatively good program in the field of foreign languages. He was
                    to become unquestionably the Institute's greatest single asset and to have an
                    influence on American foreign relations that extended well beyond foreign
                    language training.</p>
                <p>Helping Out in the Department's Reorganization</p>
                <p>While these preparations were slowly getting underway, a curious sequence of
                    events pulled me away from my concentration on Foreign Service matters in the
                    summer of 1946 and got me temporarily involved in something quite different —
                    the restructuring and operational reorientation of the home service of the
                    Department of State.</p>
                <p>I had been worrying about the disorganized state of the Department during my
                    overseas tour. Everywhere I went, from Mexico to Egypt to France, Foreign
                    Service people were complaining to me that the Department was not providing them
                    adequately either with foreign policy guidance or with administrative and
                    financial support. The general opinion was that the Department had emerged from
                    the war years with very little power or prestige, that it had been overwhelmed
                    and dominated by the huge organizations of the military services, and that now
                    that peace had come it badly needed to be built up into a large and strong
                    government agency which would be the President's principal arm in dealing with
                    world affairs. It was also evident in 1945 and early 1946 that the Department
                    was still very weak and divided, and not at all ready for its postwar
                    responsibilities.</p>
                <p>Coming back to Washington after hearing an endless stream of complaints from
                    field officers, I quite naturally began asking my colleagues in the Department
                    what they thought was wrong. Why couldn't the Department do a better job of
                    formulating American foreign policy, why couldn't it communicate its principles
                    and purposes better to its people, why couldn't it speak out clearly with one
                    strong voice? What needed to be done to make it an effective organization?</p>
                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>The answers, it seemed, were of two kinds. There was first of all the already
                    described disunity which prevailed between the old-line foreign relations people
                    in the geographic offices, on the one hand, and on the other, the new global
                    planners who were busily working to establish a whole new network of
                    multilateral agencies to deal with world problems across the board. But there
                    was an immediate problem which concerned me even more. Since it was the
                    geographic people who were actually running our foreign relations on a
                    day-to-day basis, I wanted to know how they arrived at the policies which they
                    implemented in their contacts with foreign embassies in Washington and which
                    they imparted to our diplomatic missions abroad.</p>
                <p>One answer I got was that it was not necessary for our country desk officers in
                    Washington to be guided by a written body of doctrine because they had been
                    dealing with foreign affairs all their lives and knew what they were doing.
                    Foreign policy? “Foreign policy is how we feel about things” one State
                    Department man was quoted as saying. It sounded like one of those old Proper
                    Bostonian stories where the old lady was asked, where do you Boston ladies buy
                    your hats? The answer being, “Buy our hats? We don't buy our hats. We have our
                    hats!” Just the same way, the State Department had its policies, it seemed. Such
                    an attitude stemmed from the old days when the United States was an isolationist
                    power and the State Department was mostly concerned just with observing the
                    march of international events. In those days the Department was small, most
                    officials knew each other personally, and anything that happened could be dealt
                    with quite informally.</p>
                <p>But in the postwar years, with the United States at long last asserting
                    international leadership, it was obviously necessary for us to have specific and
                    far-reaching foreign policy objectives and to work to achieve them. So I pursued
                    my inquiries more diligently, and was told that the Department made its foreign
                    policies case by case, dealing with situations as they arose. “Foreign policy is
                    made on the cables,” several officers told me. “When one of our overseas
                    embassies asks for guidance on some matter, we get together and figure out an
                    answer. Sometimes we have meetings with the various interests involved and
                    obtain everyone's viewpoint. When we have an agreement, we send out a cable, on
                    which all interested parties put their initials.”</p>
                <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                <p>It seemed to me that this was a strange way to do business. Never reluctant to
                    put my ideas in writing, I sat down at my typewriter and wrote a long
                    think-piece proposing what seemed to me a much better way to make foreign policy
                    and then to have it properly coordinated and disseminated throughout the
                    organization. Instead of making policy case by case, and then having individual
                    decisions accumulate into a body of precedents which would guide future
                    decisions, what the Department of State should do, I argued, was to have the
                    Secretary surround himself with a group of thinkers who would discuss all
                    alternatives and then hammer out a body of general doctrine, explicit and
                    consistent, which would be controlling over all individual cases and decisions.
                    Let's not have decisions governing policy, I wrote; let's have policy governing
                    decisions. Let's make sure that all the conflicting principles involved are
                    threshed out on the top level first, and not left unresolved so that endless
                    meetings have to be held at the work level every time some difficulty must be
                    dealt with.</p>
                <p>There was a lot more to my essay than this. What I tried to do was to take the
                    principles enunciated in Chester Barnard's classic book on executive management,
                    The Functions of the Executive (which had been my bedside Bible ever since my
                    Nieman year at Harvard), and apply them as best I could to the situation in the
                    Department. The first function of an executive was to make policy at the top,
                    utilizing a small staff of advisers; the second function was to set up a chain
                    of command, which would make it quite clear who was responsible at each
                    operating level and insure that all functions were clearly delegated down to the
                    proper level; and the third function was to establish channels of communication,
                    so that everyone understood policies and how they should be carried out. Then
                    the work would be distributed, but the workers would be unified. I wrote this as
                    clearly as I could and gave my essay a long title, “A Suggested Approach to
                    Improving the Efficiency of the Department of State.”</p>
                <p>No one had asked me for my ideas, so I did not submit my essay in the form of a
                    report. What I did was to take it to the editors of the American Foreign Service
                    Journal, a monthly published by the members of the Foreign Service. They looked
                    it over, liked it, and ran it in two parts which were published in the issues
                    for May and June, 1946. How many people read it I have no idea, but soon after
                    the first installment appeared, a young man in a Navy lieutenant's uniform came
                    to my office in a state of obvious excitement. He introduced himself as Just
                    Lunning, recently transferred into the Department from the OSS organization, and
                    said that he was the new chief of the Department's Division of Management
                    Planning, which was undertaking to plan a reorganization of the Department. It
                    would incorporate in one logical structure all the different disparate elements
                    which were now theoretically under the Secretary's control but had not yet had
                    their duties and relationships defined. He said that he had found the insights
                    in my article very helpful, that he would like to see the second installment
                    immediately, and that he would also like to read anything else that I had
                    written.</p>
                <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                <p>Lunning and I talked for quite a while and found our ideas congenial. He was a
                    new type to me, a large, rather awkward man who spoke English in what I later
                    learned was a Danish accent; he articulated his words as though he had a
                    mouthful of mashed potatoes which kept the sounds a bit muffled. He was about my
                    age, but had an entirely different background; I think he had spent his early
                    life in Denmark, then had come to America to assist in his family's importing
                    business. His father, I was to learn, ran the Jensen's Silver establishment on
                    New York's Fifth Avenue.</p>
                <p>After Lunning and I had exchanged views for a while, he invited me to attend one
                    of his staff meetings and talk to a group of his people along the lines laid
                    down in my Journal essay. This was soon followed by an invitation to join the
                    Division of Management Planning myself. I told my new Danish-American friend
                    that I would love to work with him on his reorganization plans, but that my
                    first loyalty was to Selden Chapin and OFS. Eventually it was arranged that I
                    could divide my time for a limited period in such a way that I could work with
                    Lunning's group for several hours a day, taking part in discussions and
                    producing a long series of papers. Thus I labored away on two jobs all during
                    the hot summer months of 1946. There came a day toward midsummer when Just asked
                    me to take all the individual reports prepared by members of his staff and
                    combine them into one coherent over-all plan. There was no air-conditioning in
                    most Department buildings in that era, so I took a huge stack of reports home
                    with me, stripped to my boxer shorts in my own study, and turned on the electric
                    fan. For a solid week I labored away, typing out several thousand words each day
                    and finally finishing my task.</p>
                <p>The summary report that I put together was not the final one that went to the
                    Secretary of State for action. Lunning and his deputy Elinor Reams added to it
                    and subtracted from it, and so did several other people. Eventually what was
                    produced was a large printed document of 90 double-sized pages, complete with
                    elaborate charts and graphs and tables of statistics. It told the story of the
                    Department's organizational history from the time of Thomas Jefferson to that of
                    Cordell Hull and James F. Byrnes, then analyzed postwar needs and resources and
                    proposed a number of alternate solutions. I still have a copy of this document
                    in my files. My name does not appear anywhere in it, but I think I can recognize
                    traces of my handiwork here and there. All I can say with confidence is that I
                    participated in the work of reorganization at a vital time in American history,
                    and that my services must have been of some value, or I would not have been
                    asked to work so hard.</p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>The report went up the line to Lunning's boss, a mysterious character named J.
                    Anthony Panuch on whom I never laid eyes. All I know is that he worked behind
                    the scenes for Donald Russell, the Assistant Secretary of State for
                    Administration, and that he apparently was responsible for recruiting Just
                    Lunning from OSS. The report was addressed to Russell and signed by a consultant
                    named O. L. Nelson. It thanks Just Lunning and Elinor Reams “who have done most
                    of the work” and “you and Mr. Panuch for your interest and continued support.”
                    It suggests that Russell should get together a high-level board which would make
                    final decisions after the report had had wide circulation and study by all
                    interested parties. I presume that those final decisions were made and carried
                    out, for the Department was in very much better shape by the time that James F.
                    Byrnes was replaced as Secretary of State by George C. Marshall, effective
                    January 1, 1947.</p>
                <p>I stopped working for Lunning some time the autumn of 1946 and returned full time
                    to my duties in the Office of the Foreign Service. Lunning himself did not stay
                    around much longer; when his report had been approved and acted on, he resigned
                    from the Department and went to work again in his family importing business. I
                    was sorry to see him go, for he was highly intelligent and an earnest,
                    level-headed man, well-equipped for the job he was asked to do. I came to like
                    him very much. I saw him a few times in New York City for the next year or two,
                    then lost contact. Word came to me some years later that he was no longer alive,
                    having died young of some fatal malady. It is my judgment that the services he
                    performed for the Department of State were most valuable. He deserves to be
                    remembered with gratitude.</p>
                <p>I had one final job to do for the Division of Management Planning before I
                    cleaned out my desk there. The Bureau of Administration, of which Lunning's
                    division was a part, decided that it was urgently important for the Department
                    of State to move out of the building next door to the White House into much
                    larger quarters where the Department's diverse units could be brought within
                    walking distance of each other. There was no perfect answer to this need, but
                    what was desired was that President Truman should give the State Department the
                    fine new building occupied by the War Department at Virginia Avenue and
                    Twenty-first Street, NW, plus a number of satellite buildings along Twenty-third
                    Street and along C Street between Twenty-first and Twenty-third. The War
                    Department was reluctant to move out, even though a new combined Department of
                    Defense was being planned with all three armed services headquartered at the
                    Pentagon.</p>
                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>My role in this affair was to be the principal drafting officer for a letter to
                    the President in which the Secretary of State would set forth the arguments in
                    favor of the requested move. A group of us, including some talented visual aid
                    specialists, sat down and developed a splendid-appearing document, complete with
                    photographs, charts, and factual statistics, which set forth the State
                    Department case. The completed document was then taken by Carlisle Humelsine,
                    the new Assistant Secretary of State for Administration, to top levels. It must
                    have been effectively drafted, for a few weeks later the President gave his
                    approval, the War Department moved to the Pentagon, and the State Department
                    took over the new complex. As is now well-known, a much larger State Department
                    building was eventually constructed, filling up the whole four-block area
                    between Twenty-first, Twenty-third, C Street and E Street.</p>
                <p>When the time came for the move, which was set for January 1, 1947, many Foreign
                    Service officers and others assigned to the geographical divisions were quite
                    reluctant to leave the building we called “the old grey lady of Pennsylvania
                    Avenue.” I heard opinions expressed to the effect that we were giving up “a
                    building which looks like a foreign office” for one with a decided military
                    appearance. For the War Department had decorated the front lobby of its building
                    with a huge mural, about 100 feet long, which showed marching soldiers, huge
                    artillery pieces, the most modern tanks, and zooming planes which were bombing
                    and strafing. It took the Department of State some years to get this most
                    unsuitable mural blotted out and painted over.</p>
                <p>Only a minority of our personnel could be housed in the main structure, the rest
                    of us going to the various satellite buildings. One of the converted brick
                    apartment houses was given to the Bureau of Economic Affairs, one was shared by
                    the Bureau of International Organization Affairs and the Bureau of Public
                    Affairs, and another went to the Bureau for Research and Intelligence, which was
                    staffed mostly by the research portion of the former Office of Strategic
                    Services which the State Department had inherited (other portions of OSS went to
                    the new Central Intelligence Agency on Twenty-sixth Street). There were some
                    temporary wooden structures on Twenty-third Street which went to the
                    Department's administrative offices and divisions. One brick building, a narrow
                    eight-story affair located at 2115 C Street, went to the Division of Training
                    Services, and it was there, on March 7, 1947, that this division was formally
                    converted into the new-born Foreign Service Institute.</p>
                <p>Bureaucratic Warfare and Its Effects</p>
                <pb facs="0060" n="Page0060"/>
                <p>Before telling the story of the Institute's early history, I must first narrate
                    what had happened to the new Foreign Service draft legislation on which my
                    friends in OFS were working. While I was on detail to Just Lunning and the
                    Division of Management Planning, the team headed by Carl Strom was moving
                    steadily ahead with its draft. The final and most difficult section of this was
                    master-minded personally by Carl. It had to do with all the provisions relating
                    to separation and retirement and specifically worked out the actuarial details
                    of retirement pensions. With his mathematical training, Carl was superbly
                    equipped for this task. Other provisions of the legislation gave the Foreign
                    Service a new class structure, with liberal salaries, but required all Foreign
                    Service officers of career to be legally “separated out”, which is to say
                    dismissed, for sub-standard performance. They were to be dropped also for
                    failure to win class promotions in a reasonable time, and to be retired at the
                    age of 60 unless they should reach the class of career minister, which was
                    equivalent to ambassadorial rank. In other words, it was an “up or out” system
                    similar to those in effect for Army, Navy, and Air Force officers, who had to
                    retire whenever they could not reach the next grade in a reasonable number of
                    years. Selden Chapin had been an Annapolis graduate and a naval officer before
                    joining the Foreign Service, and he felt very strongly about the necessity for
                    constant pruning, to keep only the best people and let the others go.</p>
                <p>There were some other important provisions. One of them placed all clerical and
                    administrative personnel of the Foreign Service, plus a considerable number of
                    consular and commercial assistants, in a separate personnel category to be known
                    as the Foreign Service Staff Corps. The Staff Corps people were expected to do
                    the bulk of the routine work. If they could pass the regional examinations, they
                    could be transferred into the FSO category. But they could avoid competing as
                    FSOs if they wished; they could stay in the Staff Corps and be advanced up a
                    separate, less-well-paid salary scale. They were to be equivalent to the petty
                    officer and enlisted men of the armed forces.</p>
                <p>A third personnel category provided for what was called the Foreign Service
                    Reserve. This was intended for temporary specialists brought into the Foreign
                    Service who had expertise in special fields for which people trained in
                    diplomacy usually could not qualify. The Foreign Service expected to recruit
                    science attach�s, cultural attach�s, and a considerable variety of economic
                    specialists by using the Reserve. Their service was limited to five years at a
                    stretch and they were expected eventually to return to stateside employment.</p>
                <p>Finally, the Foreign Service was to be administered by an official called the
                    Director General, who would report to an interdepartmental board on which the
                    principal Washington agencies concerned with the work of the Foreign Service
                    would be represented — State, of course, but also Commerce, Agriculture, and
                    Labor. The Foreign Service would thus be administered separately from the
                    Washington bureaucracy, but it would be housed in the Department of State and in
                    practical terms it would be under the Department's control, even while giving
                    other Washington agencies a voice in personnel and administration.</p>
                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>The Bureau of the Budget had a lot of reservations abut this draft legislation.
                    It did not like the pseudo-military structure and personnel system, it objected
                    to the Foreign Service administering itself through the Director General, it did
                    not like what it considered a “caste system,” putting Staff Corps employees
                    below the favored FSO corps, and it even objected to the proposed Foreign
                    Service Institute, which Budget people thought would be a sort of “ivory tower”
                    institution, designed to make sure that FSOs would operate on a higher
                    intellectual level than other Federal employees.</p>
                <p>The normal procedure for new Federal legislation prepared within the Executive
                    Board called for all drafts to be screened by the Bureau of the Budget. Only
                    when the Bureau had eliminated all parts it found objectionable, and substituted
                    provisions which it favored, would proposed new legislation be submitted to
                    Congress for study and passage. The Office of the Foreign Service knew that it
                    was supposed to obtain BOB approval, and kept the Bureau informed of all its
                    planning. But while the BOB people were still studying the draft legislation
                    something most unusual happened. Some members of the House Committee on Foreign
                    Affairs got wind of the fact that reform legislation had been drafted, and
                    demanded that this legislation be brought down to the Capitol immediately, so
                    that appropriate members of Congress would share in all the planning at an early
                    stage. The House was Republican in 1946, while the Administration was
                    Democratic. Since every Congressman detested the Bureau of the Budget anyway, or
                    so it seemed, the members of the Foreign Affairs Committee were particularly
                    delighted at the idea that they would get the first crack at reorganizing the
                    Foreign Service, by-passing the Democratic bureaucracy.</p>
                <p>Over a period of several weeks, a subcommittee of three Congressmen studied the
                    draft legislation. The chairman was John M. Vorys, Republican of Ohio. Before
                    him and his colleagues a team from OFS appeared day after day to answer
                    questions. The responsibility for answering most of these fell upon my friend
                    Strom, for better than any one else he could explain the reasons for every
                    provision and every legal phrase. The net outcome of this procedure was that
                    Vorys passed on every sentence and was enormously impressed with the accuracy,
                    completeness, and clarity of the drafting performance. Satisfied that an
                    outstanding job had been done, he and his two associates obtained the approval
                    of the whole committee, and soon the House itself had passed the Foreign Service
                    Act of 1946 and persuaded the Democratic Senate to go along. The final act bore
                    the names of Congressman Kee of West Virginia, chairman of the House Foreign
                    Affairs Committee, and Senator Connally of Texas, who headed the Senate Foreign
                    Relations Committee. It was the Kee-Connally Act.</p>
                <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                <p>Congressional approval came suddenly on November 13, 1946, and brought complete
                    euphoria to Chapin, Foster, Strom, and others in OFS. At the same time, the
                    reaction of the Bureau of the Budget was one of furious resentment. The BOB
                    tried to persuade President Truman to veto the act, but after consultation with
                    his top advisors he took the opposite course and signed it. The Bureau was faced
                    with a fait accompli. The consequences were by no means entirely happy for the
                    Foreign Service. For several years after 1946 the embittered Bureau of the
                    Budget people who dealt with the State Department budget requests were critical
                    and uncooperative. I was to operate for several years in this hostile
                    bureaucratic environment, which made it extremely difficult to obtain the
                    personnel and funds needed by the new Foreign Service Institute. At every
                    opportunity the Budget people tried to favor the Staff Corps, which they liked,
                    and to punish the FSO Corps, which they detested. In the fiscal year of 1948-49,
                    for example, it was Bureau of the Budget pressure which almost throttled the FSO
                    category; only one small group of 20 junior FSOs was appointed, while plenty of
                    money was available for new Staff Corps appointments. Later on I was to run into
                    a situation where FSOs were scarce, but a disturbing amount of deadwood was
                    accumulating in the Staff Corps.</p>
                <p>As I look back on this situation, it is my judgment that the Bureau of Budget in
                    1946 was staffed by deplorably rigid and unimaginative officials. They were a
                    doctrinaire group, trained in schools of public administration, and they were
                    not fully capable of comprehending the postwar challenge to American diplomacy.
                    The ones I knew personally were honest and public-spirited, but I doubt if they
                    could have passed the kind of competitive examinations required for entry into
                    the Foreign Service. Moreover, they were guilty of a kind of reverse snobbery.
                    Coming from very average social backgrounds, they disliked and resented
                    individuals who came from upper-middle-class families, went to private
                    preparatory schools, and attended Ivy League colleges. They apparently wanted to
                    eliminate from positions of responsibility every person who possessed, they
                    thought, any social advantages or intellectual attainments superior to their
                    own.</p>
                <p>In my work with the Foreign Service Institute, I was brought into situations
                    where this attitude of envious bureaucrats was to do harm, in my opinion, to the
                    national interest. One of them had to do with Foreign Service participation in
                    the National War College. This institution was launched in 1946 at the former
                    headquarters of the Army War College, located on military property at the
                    confluence of the Anacostia and Potomac Rivers, next door to the old Washington
                    Navy Yard. It was sponsored by the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The organizing group,
                    consisting of a senior admiral, an Army major general, and an Air Force
                    brigadier general, approached Selden Chapin that summer and suggested that the
                    Foreign Service supply students to attend their top-level institution to study
                    questions of national security alongside Army and Air Force colonels and Navy
                    captains. The idea, they said, was to select people most likely to advance to
                    top positions, military and diplomatic, so that these people of various services
                    could learn to know and understand one another.</p>
                <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                <p>Chapin called me into the picture that summer, and with him I attended a series
                    of meetings with the War College chiefs. It was agreed — not by me, for I didn't
                    count at that stage — that ten FSOs would be chosen to attend the first year's
                    course. That developed into a regular custom for several years of including our
                    most promising diplomatic officers in the student body of the National War
                    College — ten or twelve of our people along with 90-some officers of the Armed
                    Forces. These assignments were highly prized by Foreign Service officers, for
                    the National War College seemed to have unlimited funds, could attract national
                    celebrities to come and give lectures, could take all students on extensive
                    trips to view military installations, and could bring our people into some very
                    high-level discussions of American diplomatic and military policy.</p>
                <p>What bothered me about the military approach to foreign policy studies was that
                    it tended to be confrontational in character. The world was divided by the
                    military thinkers into two kinds of nations — those who thought and felt the way
                    Americans did, and were on our side as allies, and those who thought and felt
                    differently and were on the other side. In international affairs we had friends
                    and we had enemies; people were good guys or they were bad guys. If you were a
                    man in uniform, your function was to support the good guys and battle against
                    the bad guys. A world without enemies was inconceivable; that's why military
                    strength was essential to protect the national security. Diplomats didn't shoot
                    guns, but it was important that they should think like soldiers, the Pentagon
                    thought, helping the military to defeat our country's enemies.</p>
                <p>I won't say that our Foreign Service people who attended the National War College
                    course were brainwashed into thinking like their colleagues of the armed forces.
                    That would be overstating the case. But it would be remarkable if some of the
                    military type of thinking didn't rub off on many of them, and some have told me
                    that it did. In 1951-52 I was to become involved with the military myself,
                    serving a year as the State Department man on the faculty of the Army War
                    College in Carlisle, Pennsylvania. I found that I had my mettle tested many
                    times by Army colleagues who thought in confrontation terms and were not at all
                    likely to understand the subtleties and complexities of diplomacy. Anyway, all
                    during the early years of the Foreign Service Institute we wanted to have a
                    senior course of our own, but were not given the necessary funds by the Bureau
                    of Budget. So our senior people, scores and scores of them, had their educations
                    influenced by military concepts. If that was undesirable, as I think it was,
                    then one need look no further than those mediocre Bureau of the Budget
                    ideologues to fix the blame.</p>
                <p>Introducing Some New Ideas</p>
                <p>Rethinking the Foreign Service Job</p>
                <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                <p>When the Foreign Service Institute was formally established in March, 1947, there
                    were several of us on its staff who believed that a lot of new thinking was
                    needed about how to prepare Foreign Service officers most effectively to
                    represent the United States abroad and carry out American foreign policy. Before
                    World War II, educational preparation for careers in foreign affairs had always
                    emphasized international law, comparative government, and diplomatic history. We
                    thought that these subjects were useful for general background, but that in a
                    period in which the United States was hoping to exercise international
                    leadership, they did not quite get at the basic problem, which was how to
                    influence the people of other nationalities to cooperate in striving toward the
                    goals which Americans thought important. It was all very well to talk of an
                    international legal system and to set up a network of international agencies to
                    deal with all the world's problems, but were we not thinking in terms of our own
                    Anglo-American historical experience? What about all the diverse people of the
                    world whose values, problems, goals, and thought processes were quite different
                    from ours?</p>
                <p>Our group thought about such questions quite a lot. If Americans were going to
                    try to influence other nationalities, we thought, then the basic need of every
                    individual starting out on a Foreign Service career was to have a vivid
                    awareness of cultural and situational differences. A Russian, a Chinese, a
                    Japanese, or an Arab would not think like an American, an Englishman, or indeed
                    like the representative of any nationality whose historical experience was
                    entirely within the West European cultural tradition. Our young officers should
                    begin with the expectation that people of other nationalities would think and
                    feel and act differently from ourselves; that they would have their own needs,
                    their own aspirations, their own goals, and their own cultural framework.
                    Setting out with this initial expectation of differences, our young officers
                    should be equipped to analyze what these differences were, what their
                    significance was for international relations, and how they could best be dealt
                    with.</p>
                <p>Members of our group did not suppose that we ourselves had the answers to the
                    question we were raising. But we thought that at least we ought to try to
                    sensitize our fledgling diplomats to the problems they would encounter. And we
                    thought also that some of the concepts and insights of the behavioral sciences
                    would be useful to them. If effective diplomacy started with an understanding of
                    the mentality of others, as we believed it must, then we could emphasize in our
                    training courses the processes by which human personalities develop. We could
                    talk about the analysis of social and cultural surroundings, and how each child
                    is conditioned by his environmental circumstances as he grows and develops. We
                    could talk about the molding influence on ways of thinking which is exercised on
                    each individual by the language he grows up speaking. And we could emphasize how
                    important it is to understand another person's concepts and motivations if one
                    hopes to exert any influence upon him. If persuasion is the goal of diplomacy,
                    we would say, then don't think that you can persuade another human being in
                    terms of your own motivations, but only in terms of those important to him.</p>
                <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                <p>Those of us on the Institute staff who thought in these terms were particularly
                    three people, Henry Lee Smith, Jr., Edward A. Kennard, and myself. Smith was a
                    linguistic scientist and the assistant director of the Institute in charge of
                    language training; Kennard was a cultural anthropologist and linguist who had
                    worked a great deal with exotic Indian cultures of the American Southwest, such
                    as those of the Hopi and Navaho; and I was a former newspaperman, no kind of
                    expert at all, just a man with some practical experience in figuring out and
                    getting along with people. I had several friends who worked professionally in
                    the field of cultural anthropology; they had convinced me of the importance of
                    studying cultures in order to understand human behavior, and I had read some
                    twenty-five or thirty books in the field. It was because of this interest that
                    “Haxie” Smith and I soon discovered that we thought very much alike, and that in
                    consequence we arranged to recruit Kennard for the Institute staff.</p>
                <p>From this beginning we reached out to convert other members of the Institute
                    staff to our viewpoint. We had no difficulty at all in reaching a meeting of
                    minds with the experienced Foreign Service officer who was in charge of basic
                    officer training. Laurence W. Taylor was a tall and vigorous Californian,
                    initially trained to be an agricultural county agent, who had been attracted
                    toward a Foreign Service career by experiences in the First World War. Larry had
                    served mostly in European posts and had been forcibly struck by differences
                    between American and European — especially French — ways of thinking and acting.
                    Then during World War II he had been sent as a diplomatic observer to
                    Brazzaville in the French Congo. The Africans he had observed there mystified
                    him and left him with an insatiable curiosity as to how they thought and why
                    they acted as they did.</p>
                <p>With Taylor enthusiastically on our side we approached the Institute's director,
                    William P. Maddox. He had more difficulty with our ideas than Taylor because his
                    entire academic training and experience had been in political science. A Rhodes
                    Scholar at Oxford, then a PhD at Harvard, Maddox had taught international
                    relations at several universities, then had served during World War II with the
                    OSS in Italy and England. He had wonderful credentials for his Institute
                    position, but a psychological and anthropological approach to political behavior
                    was somewhat new to him. However, he had an open mind, a generous attitude, and
                    a willingness to be convinced. Soon he was giving us strong support. When Maddox
                    left the Institute in 1949 to join the FSO Corps and to make the rest of his
                    career in the Foreign Service, his successor was Harry C. Hawkins, the
                    experienced economist whom I had met in London in 1945. Harry had spent the peak
                    years of his career negotiating international trade agreements with foreign
                    governments and was keenly aware of cross-cultural factors in diplomatic
                    negotiation. He saw immediately what we were driving at and supported us
                    completely.</p>
                <p>The Remarkable Haxie Smith</p>
                <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                <p>The sparkplug of our effort to develop a more human and behavioral science
                    approach to diplomacy was Haxie Smith, a most remarkable character. He had a
                    doctorate in English philology from Princeton, and from that he had gone on to
                    become an enthusiastic expert in the sounds and idioms of American speech. In
                    the 1930's Haxie had become famous for a radio program in which he starred,
                    called “Where Are You From?” It consisted of introducing on the radio each night
                    a sequence of total strangers whom Haxie would put through a test. He would have
                    each subject pronounce a list of about 100 key words, such as “Mary, marry,
                    merry”, “water, wash, Washington”, and “greasy” (with an S sound or a Z sound).
                    After listening carefully, Haxie would analyze a subject's speech patterns, then
                    tell the audience in what area he or she had been brought up and what later
                    locations had influenced his or her speech characteristics. Without any
                    question, Haxie had the keenest ear for speech sounds of any one I have ever
                    known; he was perhaps unique in the entire United States. And he knew his
                    geography. The “greasy-greazy” line, Haxie told us, ran halfway between Trenton
                    and Philadelphia and then straight westward across the country. People in the
                    Midwest normally do not distinguish in speech between Mary, marry, and merry.
                    And so on.</p>
                <p>One evening at my home I had Haxie demonstrate his method by testing out a fellow
                    dinner guest, the wife of a Foreign Service colleague whom we were all meeting
                    for the first time. The conversation went as follows when the test was
                    completed: “Well, young lady, the basic pattern is North Shore Chicago. Right?”
                    “Yes, I was born and brought up in Winnetka, Illinois.” “But you have a strong
                    overlay of San Francisco Bay. Perhaps you went to college in that area?” “Yes,
                    we moved to Berkeley when I was 17 and I attended the University of California.”
                    “But I detect something else — a little whiff of Vermont in your speech. Was
                    there perhaps some member of your family from western New England?” “Yes, my
                    grandmother who lived with us was brought up in Vermont.”</p>
                <p>The same sensitivity to sounds which Haxie demonstrated in analyzing American
                    speech was also applied to foreign languages. During World War II, he had served
                    in the Army as a captain and major and was put in charge of preparing
                    dictionaries, instruction booklets, and other linguistic materials in a score or
                    more of foreign languages with which American military personnel needed
                    familiarity. To prepare these materials he had under him a hundred or so native
                    speakers of these languages, together with supervisors trained in linguistics
                    who would make sure that only ordinary, every-day speech was included in the
                    instructional booklets. They would then write it down in phonemic symbols in
                    such a way that an American GI could pronounce it and not have to learn the
                    Russian alphabet or a full set of Japanese characters. The spoken languages were
                    also recorded on phonograph disks and recording tapes in such a way that a
                    learner could practice alone, repeating each phrase until it was a perfect
                    imitation of what the native speaker was enunciating. While not learning the
                    languages himself, Haxie picked up the sounds of each one in such a way that he
                    could imitate them to perfection. He could also imitate the accents of every
                    nationality employed in his organization. He could tell endless anecdotes about
                    his people, imitating each person's accent, whether French, German, Spanish,
                    Russian, Arabic, Turkish or Japanese. It was a virtuoso performance.</p>
                <pb facs="0067" n="Page0067"/>
                <p>What Haxie passionately believed was that it was spoken languages which had to be
                    taught and learned; the study of the written language could come later, after
                    all the pronunciations and inflections were mastered. He wanted his learners to
                    get inside the cultural context in which a language was used and if possible to
                    get inside the heart and mind of the individual speaker. Every foreigner thinks
                    and feels in his own language, he preached, and if you're going to get close to
                    him you must learn to think in it too so that you can understand what he is
                    thinking in all its emotional coloring and what his psychological motivations
                    are. Scholarly linguistics, Haxie believed, is a separate study; leave that to
                    the academic philologists. Practical linguistics is a branch of cultural
                    anthropology, the study of human behavior in cultural contexts. It's through
                    practical linguistics that you get to know and understand people, human beings,
                    in all their complexity.</p>
                <p>Languages and Linguistics</p>
                <p>As the Institute's assistant director for language studies Haxie soon gathered
                    around him a staff of trained linguistic scientists and a large group of native
                    speakers of various languages who would conduct classroom drills. And they were
                    indeed drills. Every learner would practice basic sentences and phrases over and
                    over again until he was thoroughly fluent within a limited vocabulary. Only then
                    would the learner be permitted to range more widely afield, adding vocabulary,
                    mastering tenses and conjugations, practicing the less frequently used idioms,
                    and so forth. Within a year from Haxie's arrival the Institute was offering
                    instruction in a score of languages, familiarizing new Foreign Service employees
                    with the language of the country for which they were headed, and offering
                    language instruction also to employees of the Department, hundreds and hundreds
                    of whom would come to the Institute for a hour or two before going to work in
                    the morning or after quitting work at the day's end. Because many of the people
                    needing language instruction were not in Washington but scattered around the
                    world at foreign posts, the Institute sent its staff linguists to many foreign
                    countries, to train native teachers to tutor at embassies and consulates. They
                    were taught the Institute's methods and were not allowed to deviate from them if
                    they wished to stay employed. Later on I used Haxie's methods both in Washington
                    and at my foreign posts and found them highly effective in making my college
                    German and French truly usable.</p>
                <pb facs="0068" n="Page0068"/>
                <p>From this beginning, the Institute offered steadily more and more language
                    programs. Today, in the 1980's, I understand that it gives instruction regularly
                    in more than 40 languages and that it has the capability to teach well over 60.
                    In Haxie's day we operated under a strict budgetary handicap, which limited what
                    we could do. For the Bureau of the Budget all through the Institute's early
                    years was stubbornly determined to keep us on starvation rations; it was still
                    bitter because the Foreign Service Act had been passed without its approval, and
                    it intensely disliked the career Foreign Service and our attempts to make it
                    into a highly trained diplomatic corps. But Haxie outmaneuvered the BOB people;
                    he scouted around Washington, using his military connections, and made deals
                    with the various intelligence agencies by which we would train their people in
                    the foreign languages they needed if they would transfer budgetary funds to us.
                    It was with this additional money that Haxie was able to build up his language
                    programs, little by little, fighting every step of the way like a mountain
                    climber struggling for oxygen.</p>
                <p>The Budget Bureau dictum was that the Foreign Service Institute could have the
                    funds to do an ordinary government training job, but must not get any fancy
                    notions about imparting intellectual stimulation. We were permitted, therefore,
                    to have funds and personnel for the basic orientation of new officers, and Larry
                    Taylor could operate his program effectively, giving eight weeks of training to
                    the new FSOs who had been recruited from the officers of the Army, Navy, and Air
                    Force at the end of the war. He took them in groups of 40, and in 1947 and 1948
                    often had overlapping groups. The best people we have ever had in the Foreign
                    Service in my estimation were these new officers with wartime experience who had
                    done their share of fighting and ardently wanted to help build a new world. I
                    got to know hundreds of them, helped them to develop, and watched their careers
                    flourish. I always thought Taylor did an absolutely extraordinary job of
                    imparting to them his own idealistic enthusiasm. No one person ever had more
                    personal influence on Foreign Service attitudes. Later on he was succeeded by an
                    able assistant, Robert F. Hale, and he in turn by David Thomasson, both career
                    officers whom I had first met in my orientation travels.</p>
                <p>The Bureau of the Budget was also understanding about the orientation programs we
                    operated for the new clerks and secretaries going out in the Foreign Service,
                    and it was downright enthusiastic about what the Institute's assistant director
                    for management and administrative training was doing. He and his staff were
                    training specialists in administration and giving lectures to all trainees on
                    management subjects. This the Bureau people could understand and appreciate.
                    Administration! Whoopee! That was what government was all about.</p>
                <pb facs="0069" n="Page0069"/>
                <p>So three of the four schools of the Institute managed reasonably well. It was my
                    branch, set up on paper to offer advanced and specialized training, which was
                    frozen out and frustrated. I had a secretary and an administrative assistant,
                    but only one instructor, the anthropologist Kennard. He lectured to Taylor's
                    classes and talked to Haxie's language trainees, and we also set up some special
                    after hours seminars at which he could reach out to Foreign Service people on
                    Washington assignments. His lectures on “Understanding Foreign Peoples” stirred
                    great interest. I also operated a number of seminars on economic subjects for
                    people in the Department, and one on labor affairs. Then I got permission to
                    send ten officers each year to universities for graduate studies in economics —
                    a badly needed program to strengthen the Service's capabilities in economic
                    analysis and negotiation. Some of those who benefited from this program later
                    became ambassadors. I also worked with Haxie Smith on a program to send officers
                    specializing in Slavic and Asian languages to universities — to Columbia's
                    Russian Institute, for example, to Harvard's courses in Japanese studies, to
                    Cornell's program in Chinese studies, to Yale's program on Southeast Asia, and
                    to Princeton's Near East program. We were doing useful things, but it was an
                    uphill struggle. We were a long way still from carrying out our dream to provide
                    advanced training for middle-grade and senior officers. Instead, each year we
                    watched as the Office of Personnel sent a dozen of our brightest and best to the
                    National War College for a year of study which the military rather than the
                    diplomatic approach to our country's foreign relations would be emphasized. From
                    the Budget Bureau people came no objection.</p>
                <p>No one is ever satisfied with attempts to educate a diplomatic service for its
                    responsibilities. What the Institute undertook in its early years was
                    fragmentary and experimental. But at least our group had a fresh approach and
                    managed to be stimulating. I believe that we helped to sensitize hundreds of
                    young FSOs of those early years to psychological factors in diplomatic
                    relationships, that we put language instruction on a firm and practical basis,
                    that we helped to tighten up Foreign Service administrative efficiency, and that
                    we laid a useful foundation for the Institute's further development.</p>
                <p>Planning for the American Future</p>
                <p>It was during my Foreign Service Institute years that I first began to develop
                    some ideas about planning for America's long-range future. It must have been
                    some time in 1950 that I began wondering whether what the Institute was trying
                    to do — to help shape a better US Foreign Service — wasn't entirely too
                    unimaginative a concept. When I entered the Department of State in 1945, there
                    was a lot of lively thinking going on about how to organize the postwar world.
                    But by 1950 it was clear that the cooperative model of which our thinkers were
                    dreaming, one which promoted international peace and justice, wasn't going to be
                    brought into existence quickly, if indeed it was to be realized at all. We could
                    do a great deal to improve our State Department organization and develop our
                    most promising people in the field of foreign affairs, but there were an awful
                    lot of problems ahead.</p>
                <pb facs="0070" n="Page0070"/>
                <p>One of them was the aggressiveness and hostility of the Soviet Union, which
                    seemed not to want a cooperative world at all but rather one which was in such a
                    state of disorder that communist revolutions would be promoted. Europe was still
                    in bad shape economically, despite the helpful Marshall Plan which was just
                    getting under way. Postwar East-West relations had deteriorated sharply, and the
                    Soviets were using their veto in the UN Security Council to block constructive
                    proposals. The British, Dutch, and French colonies were seeking independence. It
                    was quite uncertain still how much could be done to bring the two principal
                    defeated nations, the Germans and the Japanese, back into the community of free
                    peoples. China's civil war between the reactionary forces of Chiang Kai-shek and
                    the Communist troops of Mao Zedong had resulted in the fall of Peking and
                    Shanghai to the Communists and the withdrawal of the Nationalists to Taiwan.
                    Most worrisome of all, the North Koreans had launched in 1950 a surprise attack
                    on South Korea, and it seemed probable that this move had been master-minded in
                    Moscow and Peking. If so, then perhaps other aggressions were in store — most
                    alarmingly along Europe's so-called Iron Curtain.</p>
                <p>In the United States, economic conditions were better than most Americans had
                    expected, for the predicted postwar depression had not developed. But political
                    factionalism was rampant. The Republicans had been out of power for a long time,
                    and spokesmen for the party's right wing were particularly outraged by Truman's
                    surprise victory in the 1948 elections. There was a steady drumfire of criticism
                    of the administration's foreign policy, much of it centering on happenings in
                    China and Korea. The China Lobby and Republican Senator Joseph McCarthy blamed
                    the Mao victory in China on American mismanagement and held Secretary of State
                    Dean Acheson responsible for encouraging the North Korean aggression. Those of
                    us working in the State Department felt both indignation and uneasiness when our
                    organization was repeatedly attacked by Republican spokesmen and accused of
                    harboring communists and communist sympathizers.</p>
                <p>I was all the more sensitive to these right-wing attacks because I was Acting
                    Director of the Institute in the fall of 1949, following the departure of Maddox
                    and preceding the arrival of his successor Hawkins. At this period the State
                    Department was accused by Senator McCarthy of letting Owen Lattimore of the
                    Johns Hopkins University, whom McCarthy called a communist leader, master-mind
                    its training policies. Lattimore, said McCarthy, had a desk in the Department,
                    from which he operated to disseminate Marxist ideas in all our courses of
                    instruction. Again and again I received anxious telephone calls from our
                    security people, and also from my own superiors in the Bureau of Administration
                    and Office of Personnel, asking me if Lattimore had a desk in our building. Each
                    time I said absolutely not, but the inquiries continued anyway because McCarthy
                    was on a spree and would not take no for an answer.</p>
                <pb facs="0071" n="Page0071"/>
                <p>Lattimore was the director of the Walter Hines Page School of International
                    Relations at Johns Hopkins, working in Baltimore. As a former Baltimorean I knew
                    him personally, had had several conversations with him, and had read some of his
                    books. He was an interesting man. In his early years he had spent considerable
                    time in China, working for a business firm in Shanghai and often making long
                    trips into the interior of Asia. He learned to speak several Asian languages,
                    including Chinese, Manchurian, and Mongolian, and was particularly fond of the
                    Mongolian people and their way of life. When Soviet Russia extended its power
                    over Mongolia and set up the Mongolian People's Republic, a religious leader
                    known as the Living Buddha, the Dilawa Hutuktu, had to flee for his life. In
                    some manner Lattimore learned of this man's plight and generously came to his
                    rescue, arranging for him to come to Baltimore. Here he remained for some years,
                    living in Lattimore's home as a houseguest and working as an adviser and
                    resource associate in the Johns Hopkins program of Central Asian studies, one of
                    three Mongolians so employed. I remember seeing the Dilawa on several occasions,
                    a tall, stately scholar in a long red robe that reached to his ankles.</p>
                <p>Knowing Lattimore and reading his books, I could never understand why he was
                    accused of communist sympathies. None of his books incorporated Marxist ideas.
                    He was sometimes critical of American policies in the Far East, but he was
                    neither pro-Russian nor pro-Chinese. What he was was pro-Mongolian; he tended to
                    look at events in China and inner Asia from the viewpoint of what would be best
                    for the Mongolian people. This was a peculiar slant which no one understood. It
                    made him something of a mystery man, but it also made him vulnerable to charges
                    that he was not a loyal American, supporting official U.S. foreign policy.</p>
                <p>Let me now focus on what was happening in the Institute in 1950. Harry Hawkins
                    arrived in January of that year to take over the position of director. I was
                    sincerely happy to welcome him, since I had been greatly impressed with his keen
                    mind and statesmanlike qualities in London five years earlier. He had retired
                    from government service in 1948 to take a teaching position in the Fletcher
                    School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University, but had let himself be lured
                    back into the State Department in the belief that at the Foreign Service
                    Institute he could make a major contribution to the future of the United States
                    and the world community. Certainly he had the capabilities for such a role, for
                    he was a thoughtful and public-spirited man, had had a wealth of experience in
                    economic negotiations as Cordell Hull's right-hand assistant on trade
                    agreements, had done yeoman service to the Anglo-American alliance during the
                    war years, and had what I would characterize as a top management mind. He was
                    the only man I ever knew in American government below the Cabinet level who
                    seemed to me well qualified to be Secretary of State, had any President seen fit
                    to appoint him.</p>
                <pb facs="0072" n="Page0072"/>
                <p>Harry had not been in the Institute position very long before he became quite
                    disillusioned with the job he had undertaken. The previous year the Department
                    had undergone another reorganization, this one master-minded by John E.
                    Peurifoy, Assistant Secretary for Administration, with the full support of the
                    Bureau of the Budget and the Democratic Congress. Peurifoy was a “good old boy”
                    from South Carolina, a smooth and sophisticated wheeler-dealer who got along
                    well with Congressmen and BOB officials, but did not much care for Foreign
                    Service types, who were much too intellectual for his taste. Under the Peurifoy
                    reorganization the administrative people in the Department came out on top, the
                    Director General of the Foreign Service was deprived of all authority, the
                    Foreign Service Institute was made a division of the Department's Office of
                    Personnel, and in general foreign operations were under the control of Civil
                    Service specialists in administrative management. In the saying of that time,
                    “the administrative tail was now wagging the foreign policy dog.” In effect it
                    was the Bureau of the Budget's revenge for having been slighted in the passage
                    of the Foreign Service Act of 1946.</p>
                <p>One result of these changes was that the director of the Institute was
                    subordinate to the chief of personnel, a complete non-intellectual who
                    understood absolutely nothing about education, never having had any
                    college-level training except a few night courses in law. Hayward P. “Pete”
                    Martin, born in Ozark, Alabama, in 1913, was a bright, pleasant young man of 37
                    in 1950. He had started his government career as a clerk in 1935 in the
                    Department of Agriculture, had become a junior lieutenant in the Navy during
                    World War II, had come into the State Department in 1945 as an administrative
                    specialist, and had a reputation as an effective operator in the management
                    field. He had become the executive director of OFS in 1946 and Peurifoy had made
                    him deputy director general of the Foreign Service in 1947 and then director of
                    the Office of Personnel in the 1949 reorganization.</p>
                <p>Pete was a likable enough guy, skillful in personal relations, but it was an
                    absurdity for a former Rhodes Scholar and University professor like Maddox or a
                    distinguished senior public servant like Hawkins to have to report to a relative
                    youngster with so little intellectual background. After Hawkins had attended a
                    few of Pete Martin's weekly staff meetings, he told me that he was humiliated to
                    think that after years of reporting directly to the Secretary of State — in his
                    time, Cordell Hull — he was now buried under so many administrative layers and
                    was responsible to an individual who understood administrative operations and
                    procedures, but very little of anything else. There was no understanding on the
                    layers above us, he felt, of the functions and responsibilities of the
                    Institute, and no concept of what it could and should do to provide the United
                    States with a fully effective diplomatic service.</p>
                <p>About this time something happened which gave us a glimmer of hope. An ambitious
                    young congressman from Alabama, Laurie C. Battle, became interested in Foreign
                    Service educational preparation and offered to help the Institute develop its
                    programs, writing a letter to the Secretary of State which was routed to Hawkins
                    for comment. Harry and I talked it over for a day, and then I came up with an
                    idea.</p>
                <pb facs="0073" n="Page0073"/>
                <p>“Harry, maybe we could pump this up into something big,” I said to him. “Let me
                    start with a question. Who, if anybody, is planning for the American future? Who
                    is giving serious thought to our national destiny in the second half of the
                    twentieth century?”</p>
                <p>“Nobody, I suppose. Anyway, nobody in the U.S. government. But what are you
                    driving”</p>
                <p>“Well, I have three kids, and the world of the next fifty years is the world
                    they're going to have to live in,” I said. “Maybe the Institute shouldn't just
                    be interested in educational improvement of the Foreign Service. Maybe it should
                    be concerned about educational improvement of the whole damned Federal
                    bureaucracy. Maybe we should be offering courses which focus on the long-range
                    future of this country for all the brightest and most promising younger people,
                    whether in the Executive Branch or over there on Capitol Hill. We could be
                    thinking about a better world for my children and your children and everybody's
                    children. We could become an institution which helps to prepare the future
                    leaders of our government for their responsibilities in the rest of the
                    century.”</p>
                <p>“That's a pretty large order,” Hawkins commented. But his eyes sparkled and I
                    could see that his imagination was beginning to ferment.</p>
                <p>We could talk with Congressman Battle, I suggested. He seemed bright and
                    interested, and he just might like our ideas — not only for the improvement of
                    the Foreign Service, but for a much expanded role. If he liked our concept of
                    operating high-level studies for future leaders all through the government, he
                    might even propose taking the Institute entirely out of the State Department and
                    making it an independent agency, serving all Federal departments and the
                    Congress as well.</p>
                <p>I was all for picking up the telephone and making a date to get together with
                    Congressman Battle as soon as possible. But Harry, a disciplined organization
                    man, said no, we couldn't do that on our own; we'd have to get high-level
                    clearance so as not to confuse the Department's congressional relations. We
                    agreed that there was no use talking to our immediate superior, the director of
                    personnel. So we skipped him and went to see Carlisle Humelsine, the Assistant
                    Secretary of State for Administration, a young man whom I liked and thought well
                    of, a 1937 graduate of the University of Maryland and a former Army colonel.
                    Born in 1915, he was just 35 in 1950, and considered something of a prodigy.</p>
                <pb facs="0074" n="Page0074"/>
                <p>Humelsine was friendly and we were appropriately cautious. We just wanted
                    permission, we said, to talk with Congressman Battle in response to his interest
                    in the Foreign Service and in in-service education. It was to no avail.
                    Humelsine absolutely forbade any such approach. Secretary of State Acheson
                    already had plenty of problems in dealing with Congress, he told us, and didn't
                    need this one. We should draft a routine reply to Battle's letter, thanking him
                    for his interest. And then we should do our own job and mind our own business.
                    We walked dejectedly back to the Institute building. Since I have never been a
                    person who enjoyed minding his own business, I have always regretted this lost
                    opportunity in 1950. It would have got me started in the future studies business
                    a whole lot sooner.</p>
                <p>Once Again, Looking to the Future</p>
                <p>Two years later I was to have another opportunity to get involved in futurist
                    planning. By this time I had left the Foreign Service Institute. Frustrated by
                    our lack of success in building it up into the institution of our dreams, and
                    worn out by several years of effort and struggle, I told Hawkins in the summer
                    of 1951 that I must have a change. He offered to support me for a National War
                    College assignment, but I opted instead for something else — an opening as the
                    State Department adviser to the Army War College, then just becoming reactivated
                    for the first time since World War II. It was located at Carlisle Barracks,
                    Pennsylvania, and I thought that I needed to get away entirely from Washington
                    and lead more of an outdoor life. Harry was willing for me to have the year off,
                    for he could see that I was struggling against fatigue. When I came back, he
                    said, he would support an appointment for me as the Institute's new director,
                    for he had had enough of the job himself and wanted to get out, retiring
                    completely from the public service. No, no, I said; I want to transfer to the
                    Foreign Service and go abroad. Please fill my position with someone else; I have
                    had all the frustration I can take. While I appreciated Harry's confidence in
                    me, I told him, the next director should be a man with a lot of clout at upper
                    levels of the Department; I did not have that clout.</p>
                <p>So I went on to the Army War College position, moving my family up to Carlisle
                    Barracks. I never returned to the Institute. My year at the AWC was a pleasant
                    and interesting one in which I joined with a faculty of about 40 Army colonels,
                    an Air Force colonel, and a Navy captain in participating for a year in courses
                    offered to 150 younger colonels and lieutenant colonels being prepared for
                    senior staff and command responsibilities. My principal functions were to
                    recruit speakers on foreign affairs from the State Department and the university
                    world, and then to attend all lectures and represent a State Department
                    viewpoint in the subsequent discussion periods. My duties were not onerous and
                    left me plenty of time to play golf at the Carlisle Country Club and enjoy the
                    fresh air and mountain scenery. My health recovered rapidly.</p>
                <pb facs="0075" n="Page0075"/>
                <p>Soon after New Year's of 1952 the War College curriculum turned away from foreign
                    policy lectures and discussions to a focus on purely Army subjects. I went down
                    to the State Department and visited Carl Humelsine and his deputy Kenny Scott,
                    telling them that now I had some extra time and would be glad to undertake some
                    special projects for the Department. How would they like me to spend my extra
                    time preparing an essay on long-range career planning for officers of the
                    Department or the Foreign Service? They were enthusiastic. A study of this
                    nature was just what the Department needed, they said, for plans were under
                    consideration to combine the home and field services into one combined personnel
                    system, a united foreign affairs service. My proposed study on career
                    development would be most timely.</p>
                <p>So I went to work and by the end of the year produced a 120-page paper with the
                    title “Career Development for a Foreign Affairs Service.” I thought a sensible
                    career development plan should envisage a time-frame of 25 years, starting with
                    young people in their mid-twenties and taking them to the age of 50, by which
                    stage they should be ready for senior positions in the united foreign affairs
                    service. Looking 25 years ahead in 1952 meant preparing specialists in foreign
                    affairs for senior positions in 1977. For planning purposes, what sort of world
                    conditions should I assume for that year? What would be the nature of relations
                    between principal nations at that time? What duties and responsibilities would
                    our diplomatic representatives have? What jobs would need to be performed, what
                    kinds of trained people would be required, and through what combination of
                    education and practical experience could they best be prepared?</p>
                <p>Some of my Army colleagues on the War College faculty had done long-range
                    military planning at the Pentagon and I obtained a full run-down on the methods
                    employed. One had to make planning assumptions, and the first essential, they
                    told me, was that these assumptions must be of such a nature that they generated
                    planning requirements. The Army at that era looked forward twenty years in
                    long-range planning. The procedure was to invent an imaginary war of some
                    magnitude which would need to be fought with the most advanced guns, tanks,
                    planes, missiles, and other weapons, and then to figure out with precision the
                    exact requirements for such a war. The particular war that they imagined and
                    planned for would probably never be fought. But by planning for it
                    realistically, the Army would acquire the equipment, material, and trained
                    soldiers it would need for whatever real war the future might bring. It would
                    take lead-time of several years to produce the necessary armaments and train the
                    personnel to use them, so the plans could not just be on paper; they would have
                    to be actually carried out and the manufacturing contracts let for the equipment
                    needed. It was a kind of game, but one which would cost money and produce
                    results.</p>
                <pb facs="0076" n="Page0076"/>
                <p>I thought about this and decided that what was sauce for the goose could also be
                    sauce for the gander. While the military people were planning for war, I could
                    be planning for peace. It could not be a simple or easy peace, for that would
                    impose on my foreign affairs agency no difficult personnel and career
                    development requirements. I would have to imagine, therefore, a very difficult
                    kind of peace, filled with continuing rivalries and tensions, a peace which
                    would place a great strain on all our diplomatic skills. No use assuming that by
                    1977 the Free World would have fought and won a war with the communist powers,
                    or fought and lost one; such conditions would not generate sufficiently
                    difficult planning requirements. Equally it would not suffice to assume a
                    peaceful political and propaganda struggle in which either side would have
                    gained an overwhelming advantage and won preponderant world power. And above all
                    I must not assume an all-out nuclear holocaust in which the superpowers would
                    have destroyed each other. For that would leave no world to plan for.</p>
                <p>No, the only assumption which made good planning sense would be a situation in
                    1977 in which no major war would have been fought, no genuine peace would have
                    been won, and neither the Communist powers or the Free World would have gained a
                    decisive advantage. In short, no decisive situation, just an ever-festering
                    continuation of unresolved political difficulties. The world of 1977 would be
                    assumed to remain very much like the world of 1952, only technologically more
                    complex and politically more dangerous. Perhaps I could assume some diminution
                    of tensions on the European front, for the Western and Eastern Europeans had a
                    common history and might well work out some adjustments. But on the Asian front
                    I could see nothing ahead except more political ferment and disruption; the
                    political factors there were far more diversified.</p>
                <p>Once I had settled on my basic planning assumptions, the rest of my project
                    flowed smoothly. We would clearly need a large and well-trained body of foreign
                    affairs experts, speaking all the necessary foreign languages, well-read in
                    world history, sophisticated in psychological factors, understanding all the
                    necessary cultures, aware of ideologies and political motivations, skilled in
                    economic and sociological analysis, and able to carry out every kind of foreign
                    affairs operation, from secret intelligence and psychological warfare to the
                    most benevolent cultural relations and economic development programs. We would
                    need experts in a hundred different specialties so that we could improve our
                    friendships and alliances with peaceful nations and build networks of
                    cooperation, on the one hand, and on the other hand isolate the warlike and
                    hostile nations, limiting their power to disrupt international peace and spread
                    revolutionary disorder.</p>
                <pb facs="0077" n="Page0077"/>
                <p>Not only would we need to train people in many different geographic and
                    functional specialties, but we would need several different kinds of people. At
                    the top we would need a small group of wise and imaginative policy planners, the
                    master-minds who would formulate the objectives of American policy and weave
                    them into a consistent pattern, developing the various plans and initiatives
                    which would be needed. We would also need a type of person I called program
                    executives, individuals with managerial experience who could administer large
                    enterprises in international economic and educational development and keep our
                    efforts to build a better balanced world situation moving steadily forward.
                    Thirdly, we would need a large group of what I called diplomatic operators — the
                    men and women who on a day-to-day basis could deal skillfully with other
                    governments and peoples, analyze situations, and to carry out our policies. We
                    would need many functional specialists — experts in influencing public opinion,
                    experts in collecting and evaluating intelligence of all kinds, experts in every
                    branch of economic and financial activity, experts in developing the educational
                    institutions of less developed countries; indeed, specialized experts in darn
                    near everything.</p>
                <p>These would be the people whose training and professional development would take
                    time and expense, even though we would not, of course, assume that they should
                    all be trained within the government service; a goodly proportion of specialists
                    could better be recruited as needed from private life. In addition to the more
                    highly developed people, the leaders and professionals of the foreign affairs
                    service, we would also need large numbers of lesser employees, clerks,
                    secretaries, administrative assistants, fiscal specialists, diplomatic couriers,
                    custodial personnel, and so on ad infinitum. Such people could be developed to
                    the needed levels of efficiency without a major planning effort. But it was the
                    leaders and more highly trained professionals with whom my paper was principally
                    concerned. We would need twenty-five years of careful personnel management, with
                    plenty of programs of in-service training, to make sure that at age 50 they
                    would be ripe for their responsibilities.</p>
                <p>It was enormous fun to put this plan together, letting my imagination run. I was
                    determined not to worry over much about which government agency would be
                    responsible for which jobs; let the bureaucrats worry about that. My objective
                    was to make sure that enough people with expertise would be produced or
                    recruited as needed.</p>
                <p>Perhaps, I wrote in my paper, many personnel planners would not want to look 25
                    years ahead. They would not think such a leap into the future made practical
                    sense. In that case we could start initially with a ten-year period. Taking 1952
                    as our first base year, we could develop a list of the people that we could
                    foresee would be needed in 1962. We could call that a Ten-Year Personnel
                    Requirements Plan. Then we could have another ten-year plan for recruiting,
                    training, and developing the necessary individuals. We could call that a
                    Ten-Year Personnel Development Plan. Each year we could examine these plans
                    critically, make whatever adjustments we considered advisable, and project them
                    one year into the future. But all the time the top personnel planners should
                    keep in mind more distant target dates, 25 years ahead, so as not to lose sight
                    of objectives and not to let our sense of direction become fuzzy.</p>
                <pb facs="0078" n="Page0078"/>
                <p>In June as the Army War College year came to an end I delivered my paper to
                    Humelsine and Scott. So what happened to it then? It was duplicated in quantity,
                    of course, and distributed around the Department for study. There were several
                    meetings at which I explained it to the various individuals who would be
                    concerned with implementing it, and at each meeting there were some kind remarks
                    about it — that it was imaginative, comprehensive, and so on. The key people
                    involved said they would get to work right away in working up the Ten Year
                    Personnel Requirements Plan.</p>
                <p>But I didn't stay around Washington to see it through myself. I was in the
                    Foreign Service by then, and getting ready for my first overseas assignment. By
                    late August my family and I were on our way to Germany in the SS America. I
                    think there was a sincere intention to carry out my plan. But 1952 was an
                    election year, and in November a Republican administration was swept into power.
                    John Foster Dulles replaced Dean Acheson as Secretary of State, and there were
                    sweeping personnel changes down the line also. Dulles had very little interest
                    in administration or in long-range planning; he was principally eager to get his
                    hands personally on foreign policy. He was trained to believe that the Secretary
                    was the man who conducted U.S. foreign relations; the rest of the Department
                    didn't much count, except for a dozen or so individuals in the Secretary's suite
                    who helped him with his highly personal operations. We were back in the Byrnes
                    era, but with some important differences. Marshall and Acheson had organized the
                    Department; it was now a coherent and functioning mechanism responsive to
                    controls. And a lot of new appointees who eagerly rushed in, looking for
                    political and personal advantage, only had to man the levers and operate the
                    machinery.</p>
                <p>My personnel plan was not totally forgotten in the Department, but not very much
                    of it was implemented either. The pendulum soon swung back toward the Foreign
                    Service, for the Republicans pushed the so-called Wriston program, named for the
                    president of Brown University who headed a reorganization committee. Under this
                    program officers of the Department who were working on the substance of foreign
                    affairs were to be blanketed into Foreign Service positions, and field officers
                    were to be rotated systematically into their vacated Departmental jobs. We were
                    to become one unified Foreign Affairs Service, using the Foreign Service
                    personnel system. The Department struggled with this Wriston program for many
                    years. But no one focused, as I had done in my paper, on planning a quarter
                    century into the future.</p>
                <p>A Period of Overseas Service</p>
                <p>Acquiring New Perspectives</p>
                <pb facs="0079" n="Page0079"/>
                <p>The year 1952 brought broadening changes in my career and an extended period of
                    new experiences through which I learned better to understand the twentieth
                    century. For in June of that year I was sworn in as a Foreign Service officer, a
                    consul, and a secretary in the diplomatic service — in short as what we in the
                    State Department called a career FSO. Thus began a period of sixteen years, ten
                    of them overseas at Foreign Service posts, in which my family and I traveled
                    widely about the world, living in foreign countries, enjoying the riches of
                    foreign cultures, and learning to feel at home in foreign languages. These years
                    abroad brought new dimensions to my educational development, for we traveled
                    through some forty different countries, crossed the oceans many times, and
                    thought deeply about the problems of the world's diverse people.</p>
                <p>It was not ambition which led me to join the Foreign Service. It would have been
                    my preference to stay in Washington, for I was genuinely in love with my work at
                    the Foreign Service Institute. I felt that my job there was uniquely what I
                    wanted to do and that I had a genuine talent for helping people to learn and
                    develop. I also had a good knowledge, I thought, of how in-service educational
                    experiences could contribute to career development, based on my own enthusiastic
                    experience as a Nieman Fellow at Harvard. Furthermore, I had a sense of mission
                    about the kind of diplomatic service I thought our country needed. I wanted to
                    see our brightest career people arrive at positions of high responsibility not
                    only with sensitivity to the motivations of people but with the broadest
                    possible understanding of world historical development. And I wanted very much
                    for them to have a conceptual feeling for the future of civilization and a sense
                    of the goals toward which our country should strive in its international
                    relations.</p>
                <p>The trouble was that I was really too excited by what I was doing. I worked
                    beyond my physical strength and by 1951 found myself suffering from serious
                    fatigue symptoms of a neuromuscular nature, a condition called peripheral
                    neuritis which brought me tingling pains in my fingers and toes and in my back
                    muscles. Part of my fatigue, no doubt, was due to the bureaucratic frustrations
                    I described earlier. There was so much that I wanted to do, and so many
                    difficulties that prevented me from doing them. I remember saying once that I
                    felt like a small boy with a water pistol trying to squirt a stream through a
                    six-inch mattress. In any event my condition could not be ignored; I needed a
                    change.</p>
                <pb facs="0080" n="Page0080"/>
                <p>The pleasant and relaxing year at the Army War College helped to improve my
                    health. I thoroughly enjoyed the Army colonels with whom I worked, and the Navy
                    captain and Air Force colonel with whom I shared an office. As mentioned
                    earlier, I spent many hours on the local golf course that year, basking in the
                    lovely views and stimulating air of the Pennsylvania hills. But Ruth and I knew
                    we had a decision to make. Rather than plunge back into the Washington
                    maelstrom, we arrived at the decision that we should try to transfer into the
                    Foreign Service. I was sure that working overseas would be within my health
                    limitations and at the same time an important educational opportunity for Ruth
                    and our three children, who were 13, 11, and 5. For myself I knew that I would
                    not be doing as important work in the field as in our headquarters organization,
                    but I also felt that working abroad would be broadening and would provide new
                    insights which later on would make me more useful in the Department of
                    State.</p>
                <p>So I applied to the Board of Foreign Service Examiners for a lateral transfer
                    from my Civil Service position which would give me equivalent rank in the
                    Foreign Service. I was then 44 years old. In my own mind I was not trying to
                    compete with FSOs of long experience, and was quite prepared to do any work at
                    which I could be useful. I was surprised, therefore, when I drove down from
                    Carlisle one day and for my oral interview found myself confronted with a
                    five-man examining panel. Not only were all my examiners man of high rank, but
                    the chairman was an old-line FSO who had spent most of his career in Latin
                    American posts. He was obviously hostile to my candidacy for the rank of Class 2
                    and in a cold tone asked me a long series of technical questions about Latin
                    American diplomatic practice. When it was all over and the other four panelists
                    had examined me more amiably on other aspects of world affairs the decision was
                    reached to reject my application for FSO-2 but to offer m appointment in Class-3
                    — a rank at which I would have to take a substantial reduction in salary.</p>
                <p>I could not reasonably object to this decision. Surely, I thought, I can work as
                    usefully at one level as another. But the superiority attitude of the chairman
                    annoyed me intensely. Only after some months could I bring myself to accept the
                    appointment, for the examination had shown no interest in my career in
                    journalism, in my wartime experiences in industry, in my work for the Office of
                    Foreign Service, or in what I had accomplished at the Foreign Service Institute.
                    I was not even asked about my current position at the Army War College —
                    although by a strange irony, the man nominated later on to be my successor as
                    State Department advisor was none other than my examining chairman! It gave me
                    satisfaction to find out from Army friends a year later that he was not
                    considered my equal in either popularity or usefulness.</p>
                <p>Before leaving the subject of my examination and taking up the story of my
                    experiences in the Foreign Service, let me have a moment of fun. One of my
                    examiners was a former high official of the Department of Commerce, a benevolent
                    old gentleman who had often been mentioned in the press back in the New Deal
                    era. For some reason his questioning focused on the fact, included in my
                    biographic data, that I had once been a student at the College of William and
                    Mary. Disregarding my protest that my undergraduate years had been a
                    quarter-century ago, he proceeded to ask me questions about my college
                    memories.</p>
                <pb facs="0081" n="Page0081"/>
                <p>Whose statue, he asked me, stood on William and Mary's front campus? It was that
                    of Lord Botetourt, I replied, wondering about the triviality of the question.
                    And who was Lord Botetourt? A rather obscure colonial governor of Virginia, I
                    replied. And what was the inscription on the base of the statue? “It reads
                    Norborne Berkeley, Lord Botetourt,” I said, pleased that I could remember. I was
                    a little irritated at these questions, however, and hoped that we could on to
                    something important.</p>
                <p>“Very good, Mr. Hopkins. Now tell us about the connection between William and
                    Mary and the Spanish-American War.”</p>
                <p>I was startled and completely floored. The Revolution, the Civil War, World Wars
                    I and II, fair enough. But the Spanish-American War, long ago forgotten by my
                    generation? I pleaded ignorance, saying I was not aware of any special
                    connection.</p>
                <p>“But Mr. Hopkins! Have you never heard of George Preston Blow?”</p>
                <p>“Yes sir, I have. He was a wealthy man living at Yorktown who gave the college
                    money for a building, the George Preston Blow gymnasium and student center.”</p>
                <p>“Splendid, Mr. Hopkins! Now you see the connection.”</p>
                <p>I was astonished again.</p>
                <p>“I beg your pardon, sir, but I am afraid I don't. Please tell me.”</p>
                <p>“Why Mr. Hopkins, George Preston Blow was on the battleship Maine when it blew up
                    in Havana harbor!”</p>
                <p>What comment should I have made to that? I was aghast. But my questioner was as
                    pleased as punch that he had baffled me.</p>
                <p>Assignment to Germany, 1952-55</p>
                <pb facs="0082" n="Page0082"/>
                <p>One factor which encouraged me to accept my Foreign Service appointment was that
                    the Department's Office of German Affairs showed interest in me, presumably
                    because I had had newspaper experience and therefore some qualifications in
                    informational activities. The State Department had recently taken over from
                    military government responsibilities for occupied West Germany, which was in
                    process of being set back on its feet as a sovereign nation. A large information
                    and cultural relations program had been developed for relations with the West
                    Germans, and individuals like me were being recruited to head up regional
                    offices. This work appealed to me enormously, for it involved re-introducing the
                    German people to the Western world after many years of totalitarian
                    “brainwashing” by Adolf Hitler and the Nazi dictatorship. I had some German
                    background from college and cultural studies and from a visit to Germany in 1950
                    and thought that my personal qualifications and interest were such that I could
                    be a useful interpreter of things American.</p>
                <p>What had been set up under HICOG, the Office of the American High Commissioner
                    for Occupied Germany, was a series of nine regional public affairs offices,
                    located in Berlin, Hamburg, Bremen, D�sseldorf, Frankfurt-am-Main, Nuremberg,
                    Munich, Stuttgart, and Freiburg-im-Breisgau. I was to take over responsibility
                    for the Stuttgart operation immediately and a year later was also given
                    Freiburg, the two offices together having as territory the new Land or state of
                    Baden-Wuerttemberg.</p>
                <p>Baden-Wurttemberg comprises the southwest portion of Germany adjoining
                    Switzerland and France. It had a population in my day of about 7,000,000, a
                    million or so of whom were Germans from further east who had fled westward to
                    escape the Russians. Some were from East Prussia, a territory seized by the
                    Russians themselves; some were from parts of Germany incorporated in postwar
                    Poland; some were from Berlin, which had been badly smashed up by the Allied
                    bombings; and some were from what the West Germans called Mitteldeutschland, the
                    Russian zone of occupation which eventually became communist East Germany, the
                    Deutsche Demokratische Republik.</p>
                <p>My area was a fascinating one, rich in history, scenery, and cultural
                    development. It was inhabited by a thrifty and hardworking population which had
                    developed skilled manufactures and made the most of rather meager natural
                    resources. Assigned to the Stuttgart Consulate General by the State Department,
                    my operation of providing American information and maintaining cultural contacts
                    with the Germans was transferred soon after my arrival to the new United State
                    Information Agency. Since I was an FSO, my status became that of a State
                    Department employee on duty to another agency, a circumstance that was not to my
                    advantage in winning Foreign Service promotions. USIA was glad to keep me as an
                    FSO on loan, heading a staff of about 20 Americans in Baden-Wuerttemberg and
                    approximately 180 German employees who worked for us as secretaries, information
                    assistants, cultural liaison workers, and especially as librarians.</p>
                <pb facs="0083" n="Page0083"/>
                <p>Although I had some regrets in finding myself farmed out to another agency, the
                    work in Germany the next three years was fascinating. The largest part of our
                    public affairs operation in Baden-Wuerttemberg consisted in administering ten
                    American cultural institutions known as America Houses, in German Amerika Haus.
                    My ten were located in Stuttgart, Mannheim, Heidelberg, Karlsruhe, Heilbronn,
                    Ulm, Pforzheim, Ludwigsburg, Tuebingen, and Freiburg. These institutions were
                    basically libraries, well-stocked with American books and periodicals made
                    available in well-heated reading rooms to large numbers of German students and
                    other readers. They were exceedingly popular with Germans and heavily patronized
                    at a period when home life was generally bleak. In addition to their library
                    functions, they also provided active evening programs of lectures, films,
                    concerts, and theatre performances.</p>
                <p>Our office in Stuttgart carried on informational and cultural contact activities
                    of several kinds. We maintained contact with two radio stations and 50
                    newspapers, to which we distributed American news and commentary, with film
                    societies all over Baden-Wuerttemberg who showed thousands of American
                    documentary films, with musical and theatrical organizations, and with the
                    Ministry of Culture which ran the public school system. A great deal of
                    important contact work was with institutions of higher learning. We had in our
                    Land three famous old universities, those at Heidelberg, Tuebingen, and
                    Freiburg, which dated from mediaeval times, plus a college of commerce at
                    Mannheim, an agricultural college at Hohenheim, and two university-level
                    engineering institutes at Stuttgart and Karlsruhe.</p>
                <p>One of our most important activities was to run an exchange of persons program in
                    which we sent each year hundreds of German civic and political leaders,
                    educators, and students on all levels to the United States for educational
                    visits. Meanwhile, a much smaller number of American lecturers and students were
                    being brought to Germany. We were particularly fortunate in Stuttgart while we
                    were there in having a Fulbright economist and his wife from California who
                    spoke German and could help greatly in all our activities.</p>
                <p>The same kinds of public affairs activities that we had in Stuttgart were carried
                    on elsewhere in West Germany, where we must have had altogether more than fifty
                    America Houses. The British and French also had similar programs, especially in
                    their original zones of occupation. They were of high quality, but ours was more
                    massive because of our superior resources and I believe it was especially
                    effective. I saw little evidence that the Germans objected to any Allied
                    activities at this period. There were doubtless many silent critics, but no one
                    in the wake of Germany's massive defeat wanted to be considered pro-Nazi. And
                    the liberal Germans who genuinely wanted to be part of the democratic West were
                    outspokenly cooperative. It was and is my view that the Allied occupation
                    policies in all of West Germany were highly successful. There was to be no
                    repetition of the ill-fated occupation of the Rhineland which occurred after
                    World War I and which had left a legacy of bitterness. This time policies were
                    conciliatory and worked extremely well.</p>
                <pb facs="0084" n="Page0084"/>
                <p>By the time I arrived in Germany in 1952 it was already seven years after World
                    War II. The economy was thriving once more, helped by currency reform and
                    Marshall Plan aid. The rebuilding of bombed areas was in full swing and much war
                    damage had already been restored. German export industries were finding markets
                    abroad; money was pouring in, and there were increasing signs of new wealth. The
                    new automobile age had arrived in Europe and by the time I left in 1955 there
                    were German cars everywhere. I often traveled by comfortable German railway
                    trains on my visits to Bonn for staff meetings at headquarters and found them
                    patronized by prosperous business leaders who not only looked well-dressed but
                    overweight from good food and drink.</p>
                <p>Living intimately among the Germans for three years I studied family and social
                    patterns with keen interest. The superior status and authority of man over
                    women, parents over children, and older people over younger ones was everywhere
                    in evidence. Those Germans who told us their reactions after visits to the
                    United States were unfailingly impressed with how much more amiable, relaxed,
                    and egalitarian they found the American way of life. But the great
                    status-consciousness of Germans, demonstrated in the compliance and deference
                    which those of lesser status showed to their superiors, seemed to us not deeply
                    rooted. Behavior was largely situational; when situations were different,
                    personal attitudes and social behavior were different. Young people were
                    strictly disciplined as children, but this discipline often had the effect of
                    teaching them as they grew up to dissemble in the presence of superior authority
                    and to escape social constriction when they could. American children seemed to
                    German parents noisy and unruly, but the Germans were astonished to note how
                    these children when older behaved so acceptably.</p>
                <p>Girls in German families appeared to me to be treated very differently from boys.
                    Daughters received more indulgent affection and grew up more psychologically
                    secure; less was expected of them than of sons, who were equally loved but
                    expected to toe the line and win success. The most important role for women, as
                    wives and mothers, was to be the comforter of male egos bruised in a social
                    system which permitted a good deal of ruthless bullying. I strongly admired the
                    German women I knew, and thought I had never known of a society in which females
                    were so important and so emotionally indispensable. German males, in contrast,
                    were both more authoritarian and emotionally far less secure. So I watched and
                    wondered. What lay behind the deference with which American officials were
                    treated at that period? I could not be sure how valid my diagnoses were, but I
                    stayed on guard. The Germans I knew were dynamic and ambitious, but rarely
                    contented. It appeared that in large measure frustration was doomed to be their
                    fate.</p>
                <pb facs="0085" n="Page0085"/>
                <p>This was particularly true because of the bitterness with which many Germans
                    regarded their postwar situation. Driven westward from their homes in the east,
                    millions of refugees had lost their homes. On top of that tragedy, Germany had
                    been divided between East and West, and a people who feel strongly about ties of
                    kinship found their normal relationships disrupted. Thus the emotional pot
                    seethed. And an enormously able people, possessing a turbulent history,
                    continued to live and wait for a future in which its dreams could begin to come
                    true.</p>
                <p>At the end of three years, I found that I very much wanted to stay in Germany
                    after a period of home leave and reassignment to new duties. What would have
                    pleased me most would have been an assignment to the political section in Bonn,
                    for as a late entrant to the Foreign Service it seemed most advantageous to
                    specialize, building on what I had already learned. This idea had support from
                    my friends in German affairs in the Department, but proved to be impracticable
                    because the embassy staffs were being reduced after the new treaty of peace was
                    signed between the Western allies and the German Federal Republic.</p>
                <p>So we went home in 1955 on “loose-pack” orders, final destination to be
                    determined after arrival. Nevertheless, we departed from Stuttgart in fine
                    spirits. My work had won me several commendations and recognitions, one of which
                    was to head a small committee which replanned the American public affairs
                    program in Germany to make it more economical and effective. I was the drafting
                    officer for the plan we devised, producing in three days a 55-page document, and
                    it was in effect before I left Germany. The American staff which I inherited in
                    1952 had been greatly improved by 1955, and was regarded by my superiors in Bonn
                    as among the best of the regional organizations. My people were a talented and
                    creative group, and they performed their work beautifully. As for myself in
                    day-to-day personal effectiveness, I was proud of the fluency I developed in the
                    German language and of my ability to deliver effective speeches in it. My family
                    made important contributions. My children were an attractive group and made many
                    German friends, while my wife Ruth was active in German-American friendship
                    societies and organized a German-American string quartet in which she became
                    well-acquainted musically. We were constantly to be seen at German chamber
                    music, symphony, opera, and theatrical performances, and our obvious interest in
                    German cultural life was favorably commented on by Stuttgart friends. After
                    years of great effort, we left in 1955 on a high note of satisfaction.</p>
                <p>Three More Assignments</p>
                <p>It was a disappointment upon returning to Washington to find that Personnel had
                    not yet worked out a new Foreign Service assignment. But there was no difficulty
                    in finding a Departmental position, and I was soon able to negotiate for myself
                    a position as deputy director of the UNESCO Relations Staff in the Department's
                    Bureau of Public Affairs. This was the Department's organization for dealing
                    with United Nations cultural affairs, and was headed by an extraordinarily able
                    man, my good friend Max McCullough. I held this position for two years, working
                    especially on cultural relations between the United States and the peoples of
                    Asia.</p>
                <pb facs="0086" n="Page0086"/>
                <p>Our office provided liaison between the Office of United Nations Educational,
                    Scientific and Cultural Affairs and the 100 members of the U.S. National
                    Commission for UNESCO. What we did was to work on projects to promote
                    people-to-people cultural and scientific relationships, and strive to improve
                    education and promote international understanding. UNESCO has fallen into some
                    recent disfavor, but in our day it was a genuine force to promote better
                    international relationships. Among my duties were planning of a big
                    international conference in San Francisco on Asian-American cultural relations,
                    participation in an East-West cultural conference in Paris, and working with a
                    group of Asian educators whom I accompanied on a tour of the United States — one
                    each from ten countries — to hold seminar discussions with American
                    educators.</p>
                <p>Because I had an able and appreciative superior, I worked hard in this position
                    and was rewarded with a promotion to the rank of FSO-2 for which I had
                    originally applied. But what I really wanted was another overseas assignment.
                    The chief of personnel proposed first that I should go out as Consul General at
                    Winnipeg, Canada. I expressed dismay and asked if I could not go somewhere more
                    exotic where I could use my foreign languages. A few weeks later I returned from
                    my San Francisco UNESCO conference to find that personnel officials had assigned
                    me to Martinique as American consul for the French West Indies and French
                    Guiana. This was certainly much more exotic than Winnipeg but an unimportant
                    post, normally given to an officer of Class 4. After some soul-searching, I
                    decided not to protest, even though I had just been promoted to Class 2. For
                    after all, it did promise what I wanted — a fascinating experience in a new area
                    and a chance to improve my fluency in French. Had I not entered the Foreign
                    Service, I asked myself, for international experience rather than career
                    advantage?</p>
                <p>The Martinique experience lasted two and a half years until June, 1960. My
                    territory consisted of two small but populous islands, Guadeloupe and
                    Martinique, then 1,000 miles to the south the large but thinly populated area of
                    French Guiana. There were about 600,000 inhabitants in the islands, mostly of
                    African origin, but in all of French Guiana only about 30,000 miserably poor
                    people living in Cayenne and some scattered villages along the coast. The
                    interior of Guiana, with an area the size of Indiana, was a barren jungle,
                    inhabited by primitive Indians and some runaway black slaves who had brought
                    their culture with them from West Africa.</p>
                <pb facs="0087" n="Page0087"/>
                <p>The economic importance of the French Caribbean territories was quite modest. The
                    islands produced cane sugar, rum, and bananas; Guiana virtually nothing, though
                    the French tried to exploit the tropical timber, excavated a little gold and
                    tantalite, and found some bauxite deposits which were too far from navigable
                    water to be readily usable. The islands made a living from rum and bananas, but
                    all three of my territories, juridically considered by the French not to be
                    colonies but overseas d�partement�s of France itself, operated at a deficit and
                    were subsidized by the French Government. The reasons for this paternalistic
                    attitude were complex and were the subjects of some of my analytical despatches.
                    The French spent quite a lot of money providing their Caribbean territories with
                    social services. The schools in Martinique, for example, were excellent, and my
                    younger son Richard benefited greatly from his courses at the local lyc�e. But
                    having educated the local children there were relatively few jobs for them after
                    school except to go back to the cane fields and rum factories. The combination
                    of literacy and poverty produced a population which was frustrated and restless,
                    open to the appeal of communism. Keeping an eye on communist activities in the
                    area was a principal reason for maintaining the Martinique consulate.</p>
                <p>The consular work with visas and passports was new to me, but not difficult, and
                    my small staff was easy to manage. Political and economic reporting were no
                    problem for a former journalist, and I wrote several hundred despatches to bring
                    Washington files up to date on a long list of subjects which my less prolific
                    predecessors had frequently neglected to cover. Although my French at the
                    beginning was rusty, I worked on it religiously and soon brought it to a
                    satisfactory proficiency. Maintaining cordial relationships with French
                    officials and local white business leaders on the one hand, I worked through
                    cultural contacts to establish sympathetic contacts with local black politicians
                    and cultural leaders on the other. It was a tricky business to keep on good
                    terms with all three groups simultaneously. But I was able to follow all
                    developments in my territories closely, and by the time I left I was confident I
                    had done about as much with my job as was possible.</p>
                <p>The trouble with my area was that it was not of much intrinsic significance. Not
                    very much happened there which was of interest to the embassy at Paris or the
                    French desk in Washington. Once there were some riots which stirred up
                    publicity, and the nervous French government sent a cruiser and some air-borne
                    police reinforcements. But I watched closely and noted that the looting and
                    burning were the work of unemployed teen-agers, not noticeably participated in
                    by communist politicians. The only time my area was really in the center of
                    attention was when President Charles de Gaulle visited us after an ego-pleasing
                    official reception in the U.S. in 1960. He was for the moment quite euphoric
                    about Americans and treated my wife and me with special courtesy.</p>
                <pb facs="0088" n="Page0088"/>
                <p>When my Martinique assignment approached its end, I had trouble once more with
                    personnel, which wanted again to send me to Canada, this time as the number two
                    at the Montreal consulate general. I decided that the time had come to assert
                    myself and insist on an assignment at my proper level. By a combination of
                    personal letters to friends in high places and an official protest to the
                    Director General of the Foreign Service I was able to get myself appointed
                    instead as the American consul general at Melbourne, Australia. This was
                    unorthodox procedure, but it worked in my case for my friends stood by me and
                    justice prevailed. My experience illustrated a serious weakness in Foreign
                    Service personnel practice; the most desirable assignments are made by the
                    Office of Personnel largely on the basis of name requests from senior officials
                    for FSOs whom they know personally, or who have well-established reputations.
                    The way to get a good assignment, therefore, is to arrange for the employing
                    office or post to put in a request for you. The efficiency reports written by
                    superiors do not carry as much weight as they should. My own experience was
                    instructive, for after I had raised a stir and arranged to have myself more
                    properly reassigned to a more prestigious post, I found myself immediately
                    treated with more deference and new respect.</p>
                <p>The Melbourne assignment turned out to be easy and pleasant — in modern parlance,
                    “a piece of cake.” It was not as politically significant as working in postwar
                    Germany, or as difficult as maneuvering amid the intricacies of the Caribbean.
                    But the Australians were psychologically interesting. A people of British
                    culture, they were isolated from their homeland in a remote portion of the
                    world, and had deep-seated worries about their future, particularly when events
                    in World War II demonstrated that their British mother country was no longer
                    powerful enough to protect them. They had come to look upon the United States as
                    a substitute protector, and Ruth and I found our hosts so hospitable and
                    friendly that we rode a continuous popularity wave of popularity throughout our
                    three-year sojourn.</p>
                <p>My consular district comprised the Australian states of Victoria and Tasmania,
                    with populations of 3,000,000 and 400,000 respectively. We found the inhabitants
                    of our area energetic and prosperous, with a deep love of the outdoors. Many
                    aspects of their character and personality fascinated me, and before I left the
                    country I filed with the State Department a long despatch in which I analyzed
                    the values and attitudes which it seemed to me were governing in Australian
                    life, both private and public. I particularly occupied myself with the
                    Australian future, concerned about what would happen to this nation of
                    attractive people as they sought to work out their destiny so close to the
                    teeming billions of Asia and so far from the peoples of European stock whom they
                    regarded as their natural affinities.</p>
                <pb facs="0089" n="Page0089"/>
                <p>Our Embassy to Australia was located in Canberra, an artificial capital which had
                    been built in the sheep country of New South Wales. But Australia, despite its
                    great distances, is basically an urban country which seeks to develop
                    manufactures; most of the population lives in a few great cities, of which
                    Sydney is the largest and Melbourne a close second. My position in Melbourne was
                    a pivotal one for observing political trends, for Victoria was a “swing state”
                    in national elections and the leaders of all four political parties lived in my
                    area and provided me with much useful information. Thus I came to know five
                    Australian prime ministers who were in office in my day or achieved the position
                    in later years. Two of our good Melbourne friends were chosen by the British
                    throne to hold the position of Director General at Canberra.</p>
                <p>Ruth and I were fascinated to have the opportunity while in Melbourne to meet
                    Queen Elizabeth II of Britain and her husband Prince Philip when they toured
                    Australia on a royal visit. They were entertained at an official dinner to which
                    we were invited and at which it was arranged that we should chat individually
                    for a few minutes with each of the royal pair. As many had before us, we found
                    the queen attractive and charming and Prince Philip a lively and forthright
                    conversationist. The purpose of their visit was a fence-mending one; the British
                    Government had aroused bitterness in Australia by choosing British membership in
                    the European Common Market over the old system of empire trade preferences. The
                    Australians made it clear that despite their affection for the royal family,
                    they were determined from then on to act in their own self-interest, building up
                    their own economy by continued European immigration and increased
                    manufactures.</p>
                <p>There were many problems which worried thoughtful Aussies. First of all, there
                    was the security situation of a country with limited resources, needing help
                    from its friends. Another was lack of population. Australia's population was
                    only about twelve million in our day, and is still only about fifteen million.
                    Indonesia next door has over a hundred million, which frightens Australians
                    worried lest some of this population might spill over into lightly peopled
                    portions of their own northwest. Australia would feel much safer if it could
                    have forty to fifty million inhabitants, but it wants them to be of European
                    stock, not Asian. A vigorous policy of selective immigration has been in effect
                    many years, but results accumulate slowly. Another problem which gives
                    Australian business leaders concern is that their industries cannot compete
                    successfully on world markets because of Australia's small-scale, high-cost
                    factories. A much larger home market would provide economies of scale.</p>
                <pb facs="0090" n="Page0090"/>
                <p>While I was deep in the midst of Australian affairs, I received a telephone
                    message one day in 1963 that Lincoln White, the State Department's popular press
                    spokesman, had been appointed to be the new consul general in Melbourne, and
                    that I would be assigned to a position in Washington. The decision was made
                    suddenly, for reasons emanating from the top level of the Department. There was
                    no reason to hurry home, I was informed. So Ruth and I, who had already used our
                    time in the Far East to visit Hawaii, Japan, and Hong Kong on other trips,
                    traveled by a leisurely round-the-world route, with stops at Bangkok, Teheran,
                    Istanbul, Athens, Belgrade, Vienna, Stuttgart, and Paris. At each stop we were
                    warmly received by old friends, and stayed long enough not only for sightseeing
                    but for me to engage in useful talks with professional colleagues and inform
                    myself more fully on world conditions.</p>
                <p>This interesting journey of several weeks concluded the overseas phase of my
                    Foreign Service career. During my various official journeys and recreational
                    explorations I had managed over many years to visit six continents and obtain
                    insights into many different kinds of human societies. Join the Foreign Service
                    and see the world! I did not feel that I had become a diplomatic expert, but
                    everywhere that I went I explored the minds and feelings of a great variety of
                    people. And the effect of that increase in human experience was to expand my
                    horizons and make me feel more of a world citizen, concerned not just about
                    America but the future of our entire global civilization.</p>
                <p>Becoming a Long-Range Policy Planner</p>
                <p>Return to the State Department</p>
                <p>To be assigned back to the Department of State in the fall of 1963 was by no
                    means an unwelcome development in our lives. From a family point of view, we
                    would see much more of our two older Nicholas and Martha, who were already
                    beginning their adult careers in the United States; our youngest, Richard, would
                    be ready to enter Harvard in September 1964. Moreover, we had a serious problem
                    in the health of my wife. For several years Ruth had been suffering from a
                    degenerative muscular condition, a genetic disorder known as myotonic dystrophy
                    in which she lost muscle cells from year to year more rapidly than she could
                    replace them. She had carried on magnificently as a Foreign Service wife in
                    Martinique and Melbourne, but it was now necessary that she should lead a much
                    quieter life.</p>
                <pb facs="0091" n="Page0091"/>
                <p>Professionally I thought too that it was time to come home. My family and I had
                    enjoyed living in foreign countries and experiencing the fascinations of
                    different cultures. But when I thought about the work I had done in representing
                    the United States in Germany, the French Caribbean, and Australia, in carrying
                    out American foreign policy, and in reporting to Washington my analyses of all
                    that was happening, it did not seem to me that my accomplishments were in any
                    way extraordinary, or that they were particularly fulfilling. Perhaps I had done
                    a few things which made some minor difference in the world of international
                    relations, but in general it seemed to me that my overseas assignments lacked
                    challenge. In the Department, on the other hand, one worked at tasks which were
                    important to the future of our country and which might affect the global
                    community as well. I looked forward to the possibility that my next assignment
                    would be one comparable in importance to the work I had done in the immediate
                    postwar years in helping to reorganize the Department and improve the future
                    capabilities of the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>But when I reported on arrival to the Office of Personnel, I received a rude
                    shock. Not only did Personnel not have an assignment ready for me, but none was
                    even remotely in sight. There were not enough positions to go around, and
                    hundreds of Foreign Service men and women were wandering the corridors of the
                    Department, looking for some kind of work that they could do until formally
                    assigned to something.</p>
                <p>What had caused this strange situation? It was the victory of President John F.
                    Kennedy in the election of November, 1960, and the determination of his
                    political manager, his brother Robert, to reward as many loyal supporters as
                    possible. What had happened in the case of the State Department was that the
                    Kennedy people had discovered the personnel category known as the Foreign
                    Service Reserve. I knew all about the Reserve because it was something we had
                    planned in the Office of the Foreign Service in drafting the 1946 legislation.
                    The original purpose was to have a personnel category which could be used for
                    mature specialists recruited from private life for overseas positions of a
                    temporary nature. What we had had in mind was highly trained individuals who
                    could take a leave of absence from university positions, labor unions, business
                    firms, and so on and then serve overseas for from two to five years doing
                    specialized work for which the regular Foreign Service was not well staffed.</p>
                <pb facs="0092" n="Page0092"/>
                <p>There were no statutory requirements for FSR positions. The idea was that the
                    Foreign Service would recruit only individuals it wanted, with specific
                    positions in mind — a well-known scholar to be cultural affairs officer in
                    Japan, for example, or a minerals specialist to follow mining developments in
                    South Africa, or a petroleum geologist to serve in the Persian Gulf area. But
                    the fact that there were no formal procedures required left the door wide open
                    to political exploitation. Bobby Kennedy could send a job applicant over to
                    State with a note saying, employ this individual at such-and-such a rank in the
                    Foreign Service Reserve, and who was in a position to say him nay? Wherever
                    budgeted vacancies could be found around the Department, Kennedy followers were
                    slotted into them. Whether they were qualified or not few of us knew. But the
                    result was that many positions normally used for career Foreign Service people
                    rotating into Washington for State Department assignments were no longer
                    available. Every budgeted position was occupied.</p>
                <p>The Department in those days used to publish a booklet called the Foreign Service
                    List, showing where each individual of officer rank (including FSRs) was
                    assigned. I carefully combed through this list that fall and found that about
                    400 FSRs were assigned to Departmental positions. Undoubtedly most were
                    political appointees, listed as FSR-l, FSR-2, FSR-3, or FSR-4. In a Department
                    the size of State, with 1,500 to 2,000 FSOs employed worldwide, this would be
                    enough to jam up the FSO assignment machinery and make it virtually unworkable.
                    It was also enough to run up a budget deficit of several million dollars; 400
                    salaries averaging $20,000 each would be $8,000,000 for example. The new
                    appointees had to be paid, and yet the unemployed FSOs, of whom I was one, had
                    to be paid too. We had legal tenure and could not be discharged except for
                    cause.</p>
                <p>Some unemployed FSOs could be farmed out to other Federal agencies, some could
                    find unbudgeted work where an extra person could be used, and some could be sent
                    over to the Foreign Service Institute for additional in-service training. But
                    our morale was very, very low as we observed the Kennedy appointees sitting in
                    our jobs and doubtless having a fine time feeling important.</p>
                <pb facs="0093" n="Page0093"/>
                <p>Each jobless individual doubtless worked out some kind of solution, as best he or
                    she could. In my case I found an unoccupied desk in the office of the Career
                    Development Staff, which was headed by an old friend of mine. He put me to work
                    — quite informally, of course — and kept me busy for several months evaluating
                    dossiers of my brother officers, writing up summaries of their performance to
                    date, and mapping out some suggestions for future career development. Then the
                    Board of Examiners, headed by another old friend, asked me to give its
                    operations a major part of my time, and during the early months of 1964 I was a
                    member of three-man panels which gave oral interviews to about 200 candidates
                    for the career Foreign Service who had passed their written exams in 1963 and
                    now were up for final consideration. It was interesting work, but I was
                    dissatisfied with the lack of imagination showed by many of my fellow examiners.
                    They were not supposed to ask factual questions but to engage the applicants in
                    conversation, find out how their minds worked, evaluate their personalities, and
                    determine their suitability for the Foreign Service. This policy was poorly
                    observed; too often an individual examiner only attempted to discover how good
                    the applicant's background was in his own particular specialty.</p>
                <p>When the seasonal need for BEX examiners slowed down, I was off on another tack.
                    I went to Robert Manning, Assistant Secretary of State for Public Affairs, and
                    offered to help out in drafting speeches for officers of the Department.
                    Manning, who knew me as a fellow alumnus of the Harvard Nieman Fellow program,
                    accepted my offer, and in April and May, 1964, I occupied one of his desks
                    “ghosting” speeches.</p>
                <p>A New Department Assignment, 1964-1967</p>
                <p>While I was as shocked as any one by the assassination of President Kennedy,
                    which occurred about three weeks after my arrival in Washington, the State
                    Department was much better administered under his successor. With Lyndon Johnson
                    in the White House, Bobby Kennedy no longer had free rein to pack our Department
                    with his people. Conditions slowly returned to normal, and by a process of
                    attrition jobs for FSOs began opening up again. I kept in touch with friends
                    here and there, including some Assistant Secretaries whom I knew, and in June I
                    was able to negotiate for myself a position as the director of a large office in
                    the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs, replacing one of the new FSRs
                    whose performance had been found unsatisfactory. This bureau, known as CU, was
                    concerned with the Department's cultural relationships with other countries, and
                    especially with the international exchange of persons under the Fulbright-Hays
                    program. CU has now been transferred, I believe, to the U.S. Information Agency
                    — in my opinion not entirely a happy arrangement. For the word “cultural” takes
                    on different coloration when coupled with programs which imply some degree of
                    propagandistic persuasion.</p>
                <pb facs="0094" n="Page0094"/>
                <p>My portion of CU was called the Office of U.S. Programs and Services, and its
                    function was to be responsible for the American side of the international
                    exchange of persons programs. For example, our staff of 110 developed programs
                    for official foreign visitors to the United States, it selected and sent abroad
                    “American specialists” who could visit other countries lecturing in their fields
                    of expertise, it supervised the selection of American students, teachers, and
                    university scholars who would go abroad on academic fellowships, and it
                    similarly maintained supervision over the placement of foreign students,
                    teachers, and university research scholars in American institutions. Much of
                    this work we did not do ourselves, but farmed out to nongovernmental agencies
                    working for the Department under contractual arrangements. Our job did involve a
                    great deal of contact work, however, both with universities and with civic
                    organizations set up to provide local hospitality to visitors from abroad.
                    Starting in late June, 1964, I spent three years in this work. It seemed to me
                    that the exchange of persons between the United States and other countries all
                    over the world was one of the most important forms of diplomatic activity,
                    having implications both for the future of American foreign relations and for
                    the future of the international community of which the United States was a
                    member. It could not be expected to have a huge immediate impact, but if we went
                    on exchanging selected individuals with foreign countries at the rate of several
                    thousand each year, the cumulative effect, looking many years ahead, would
                    necessarily be enormous.</p>
                <p>Reflecting on this prospect, I began asking myself a number of questions. How did
                    our programs of educational and cultural exchanges contribute to the long-range
                    objectives of American foreign policy? And what were these objectives? One heard
                    a good deal of rhetoric about improving international understanding and creating
                    an enduring world peace, but it was always vague, always words, words, and more
                    words. Specifically what kind of global community did the United States seek to
                    create, looking ahead into the twenty-first century? How could we develop more
                    peaceful relations with communist countries? What about the Third World? To what
                    extent could economically backward countries be developed over the next several
                    decades and generations, and by what means? What about such planetary problems
                    as increasing overpopulation, insufficient food production and distribution,
                    depletion of energy fuels and scarce mineral ores, and increasing damage to the
                    earthly biosphere through environmental abuse? Through what kinds of
                    arrangements should our policy planners seek to have the world community cope
                    with such problems? Would the promise of future technology justify optimism? And
                    what about the threat of political struggles and the economic burdens of
                    military armaments?</p>
                <pb facs="0095" n="Page0095"/>
                <p>There began to take shape in my mind an essay on the long-range objectives of
                    American foreign policy, an essay setting forth in broad terms the kind of world
                    situation we should strive to achieve. I had never seen such an essay which
                    looked ahead into the changing future world. I thought it was high time someone
                    should attempt to write one, and I was willing to try my hand at it. In the
                    middle 1960s American scholars were beginning to discuss the prospects for the
                    year 2000 and what should be done to prepare for it. We were entering in 1967
                    the final third of the twentieth century, with the twenty-first beginning just a
                    generation ahead. Among those writing books on the future outlook were Kenneth
                    Boulding at the University of Colorado, Daniel Bell at Columbia and later
                    Harvard, Harrison Brown at the California Institute of Technology, and Herman
                    Kahn at the Hudson Institute. In Europe there was also activity looking forward
                    to the new century, and a conclave of scholars was held in Oslo whose papers
                    were gathered in a hook called Mankind 2000. And in Washington a group of
                    younger man — scientists, journalists, educators, government planners —
                    organized in 1966 what was to be a particularly fruitful enterprise. It was
                    named the World Future Society, and I shall describe it later.</p>
                <p>An Essay on the Year 2000</p>
                <p>Since I was employed in the State Department's Bureau of Educational and Cultural
                    Affairs, I slanted my think-piece on long-range policy toward our work in this
                    bureau, calling it “International Education in Tomorrow's World: The Challenge
                    to American Diplomacy.” It was a 76-page paper in which I tried to put the
                    exchange of persons work we were doing into the framework of American planning
                    looking toward the year 2000 and the century ahead. Educational and cultural
                    diplomacy, I conceded, would not produce any immediate solutions to world
                    problems and tensions, either those between the Western countries and the Soviet
                    Union, or those between the advanced industrial countries of the northern
                    hemisphere and the lagging tropical and subtropical countries of the Third
                    World. What most disturbed me at the time was the widening gap between the
                    developed and underdeveloped countries. We were living in a dichotomized world.
                    One part was composed of advanced countries of high education, the other of poor
                    and backward countries, whose populations were mostly illiterate. In the richer
                    part of this dichotomy, the average individual was calculated to be twelve times
                    as well off as his counterpart in the poorer countries. But Hudson Institute
                    forecasters predicted that by the year 2000 he would be eighteen times as well
                    off because of the advanced countries' more rapid economic growth.</p>
                <pb facs="0096" n="Page0096"/>
                <p>Among the books which influenced me was The Next Hundred Years, written by three
                    Caltech scientists, Harrison Brown, James Bonner, and John T. Weir, and
                    published in 1957. Using statistics available in the early fifties, they
                    calculated that world population would reach eight billion by the year 2050, but
                    that civilization could keep pace with this increase by using improved food
                    production methods and other technologies. The critical problem, they thought,
                    was that the United States and other leading countries should maintain high
                    educational standards and keep up the supply of scientists, engineers, and
                    social planners. If so, then the future of the human race could be soundly
                    managed. The authors hoped that by the year 2050 humanity would have the
                    capability of controlling population increase and creating a stable planetary
                    society for the indefinite future.</p>
                <p>But when I wrote to Professor Brown about these findings and asked for further
                    reading suggestions, his reply was a shocker. It was a little paperback volume
                    called The Next Ninety Years in which he and his colleagues had taken a second
                    look in 1967 at their forecasts ten years earlier. Their 1957 optimism that the
                    future was manageable had given way to deepening pessimism. Statistics on
                    population growth now showed that death rates had dropped dramatically since
                    1950 because of the spread of new health technologies to the less developed
                    countries. World planners would no longer have a full century in which to
                    prepare for a population of eight billion. Increase rates were now soaring, with
                    birth rates as high as before, and the eight billion level would be reached soon
                    after 2000. Meanwhile, increased food production was making slow progress. World
                    fishery catches had reached a peak and were declining, agricultural improvements
                    were slow in developing, and the nourishment outlook faced an uncertain future.
                    In short, global trends were alarming. The orderly and sustainable future
                    visualized by the Caltech authors 100 years ahead now looked very doubtful.</p>
                <p>As I worked away on my essay, I became increasingly disturbed at the indications
                    of a very difficult future. Late twentieth century civilization seemed in 1967
                    to be frighteningly out of balance. Humanity was greedily demanding too much of
                    the resources and living space provided by our small planet. The artificial
                    world which we called civilization was dependent on the natural world, which we
                    seemed to be trying to over-exploit. Progress didn't need to be speeded up, but
                    slowed down before humankind irretrievably damaged the Earth's carrying
                    capacity. Another imbalance was that of the dichotomized world, with the rich
                    nations growing richer while the poor were increasingly threatened with mass
                    poverty and hunger. And the most dangerous imbalance of all appeared to be that
                    between increasing human capacities in technology and lagging abilities in
                    social and political management. Wisdom was not keeping up with power.</p>
                <pb facs="0097" n="Page0097"/>
                <p>My paper covered a lot of ground. Looking at the various imbalances, it argued
                    that American foreign policy should seek to ease the contrasts of the
                    dichotomized world, that it should strive strenuously to get overpopulated
                    nations to reduce birth rates, and that it should take the lead in promoting
                    international cooperation for global planning. We had not been at all successful
                    in our aid programs to the Third World, despite President Truman's Point Four
                    program of technical assistance. What had been wrong? To begin with, we had
                    naively underestimated the difficulty of the job. Misled by the quick success of
                    Marshall Plan aid to European countries, we had expected somewhat similar
                    results in backward, underdeveloped countries — results which required decades
                    upon decades of education and training. We had not sufficiently emphasized
                    control of population, and now survival rates of young children were lowering
                    per capita improvements in productivity. We had not put sufficient emphasis on
                    education, for in dealing with illiterate and unskilled people we had not
                    realized that economic development had to be won first on the educational front,
                    as it had been in the United States all through the nineteenth century.</p>
                <p>The American public and their government had imagined that the introduction of
                    machinery and sophisticated industrial processes would produce overnight
                    miracles. But the societies which we tried to help were not ready for such
                    advanced technology. The aid program for many years was a great boon to American
                    manufacturers of machinery and to American engineering firms delighted to go
                    abroad and build dams and bridges and seaports, even educational institutions.
                    At one time Congress boasted that 90 percent of foreign aid money was being
                    spent on purchases and services in the United States. But was this what we
                    should have been doing? The missing element was adequate schooling and training
                    of populations. And the time frame for this was more like half a century than
                    the few years of any American presidential administration. A truly long-range
                    American policy was needed, I concluded, which planned for generations ahead and
                    which did not depend on quick results for public approval.</p>
                <p>Some Consequences of My Efforts</p>
                <p>How much effect can individual papers like mine, even if carefully prepared, be
                    expected to have on a great bureaucracy like the Department of State? My paper
                    was reproduced in 100 copies and distributed to my colleagues in our bureau. We
                    had staff meetings set aside in which we discussed it. But there was no effort
                    in CU to promote my ideas in other sections of the Department. I remembered an
                    old saying in the British Foreign Office that when you write a memorandum, it is
                    less important what you say in it than it is to whom you distribute your copies.
                    Accordingly I made a strong effort to distribute copies of my essay around the
                    Department of State, working through personal friends and key people who might,
                    I thought, actually read what I had written.</p>
                <pb facs="0098" n="Page0098"/>
                <p>One copy went to a friend who recommended it to his boss, who read it and sent it
                    on to Henry D. Owen, the director of the Policy Planning Council. The “old-boy
                    network” was beginning to function. I had made several efforts in past years to
                    get acquainted with the Policy Planning Council, without any success whatever.
                    Walt W. Rostow, Owen's predecessor, had only recently given me a quick brush-off
                    when I tried to get him to read some memos. But Henry Owen, on the contrary,
                    actually read my essay and then telephoned me. “Please come to see me,” he said.
                    “Bring copies of other papers you have written. I find your ideas
                    stimulating.”</p>
                <p>That was the opening wedge through which I was eventually detailed to the Policy
                    Planning Council. I did show Owen other papers which I had written — papers on
                    how best to focus on educational assistance to Third World countries, and papers
                    on how satellite television, then still in a developmental stage, might be
                    utilized to make it possible for advanced countries like the United States to
                    reach Third World countries with educational programs on a much larger scale. A
                    wise use of this new medium, I hoped, might bring greater international
                    understanding and promote progress toward global cooperation. Owen liked my
                    ideas and read my papers. He was imaginative and had a lively mind. We got on
                    well together. At last I had found someone I could talk to.</p>
                <p>One day toward the end of 1967 Henry Owen made me a proposition — to join his
                    staff and work on a paper requested by the White House. President Lyndon Johnson
                    had become interested in the feasibility of using “the miracle of satellite
                    television” to bring educational programs into the classrooms of less developed
                    countries. He had promised delegates to a 1967 world conference on education,
                    held in Williamsburg, Virginia, that the United States would try to help them
                    solve their problems in this way. It would be my job to look into questions of
                    teaching by television and see how the new satellite system could best be
                    employed.</p>
                <p>I knew very little initially about the classroom use of television, but was eager
                    to see what possibilities it had and how they could be realized in international
                    education. Anyway, I was eager to join the Policy Planning Council, so for the
                    next several months — the last before my approaching statutory retirement from
                    the Foreign Service — I worked under Owen with a group of highly selected
                    officers, charged with the responsibility for looking ahead on emerging policy
                    issues and providing Secretary of State Dean Rusk with ideas he could use. So
                    the final months of my State Department career were spent in the place where I
                    most wanted to be, attending all staff meetings and discussing with colleagues
                    the various policy proposals being prepared for the Secretary's office. At long
                    last, it seemed to me, I was in the right place for someone of my creative
                    temperament. It was the high point of my career.</p>
                <p>The Policy Planning Council</p>
                <pb facs="0099" n="Page0099"/>
                <p>The Policy Planning Council was the brainchild of Secretary of State George C.
                    Marshall when he joined the Department in 1947. I believe that his instinct was
                    correct — that the Department should formulate its long-range goals and then
                    elaborate the year-to-year policies and programs which would promote progress
                    toward these objectives. The trouble was that the individuals charged with
                    direction of the planning function kept changing, and each of them had ideas
                    that were somewhat different. When George F. Kennan was the chief planner, his
                    interest was quite naturally in Soviet-American relationships and how it was
                    best to work to keep these on an even keel. Some of his successors could not
                    think in terms of long-range objectives, or were not allowed to by the pressures
                    they were under, for one frequently heard of Policy Planning personnel working
                    on current problems. They were advisers on policy, but they were not people who
                    planned it much in advance.</p>
                <p>When I got back from Australia in 1963 and for several months had some free time,
                    I looked into what the Policy Planning Council was doing. The Council's
                    secretary, a personal friend, showed me some of the documents it had produced.
                    The definition of planning was that the Council should study situations likely
                    to become critical within three to five years and should outline a proposed set
                    of policies. I looked over several papers and was not at all impressed. The
                    problem was partly, I thought, that our expectations were too optimistic, that
                    they tended to assume that our policies were succeeding. It seemed to me that
                    the Council often needed to be pessimistic, to assure that our present policies
                    were not working or would not work in the future. So I sat down and drafted some
                    ideas to which of course no one responded.</p>
                <p>One of my ideas was that at least one policy planning paper should assume failure
                    in Vietnam; it should make the drastic assumption that in ten years time,
                    communist governments would control all of Southeast Asia. To deal with this
                    possibility, we could use the intervening ten years to pour economic and
                    military aid into Australia and make it into an impregnable bastion of strength
                    for the Free World. In another paragraph, I suggested that we make some
                    pessimistic assumptions on Latin America. We should assume now, in 1963-1964,
                    that one or more Latin American countries would adopt communist governments in
                    the next ten or twenty years. To forestall the impact of this, a policy planning
                    paper should propose long-range American countermeasures, involving the building
                    up as model democracies of several Latin American states. But the Policy
                    Planning Council, it seemed, was not supposed to be pessimistic; it must always
                    assume that American and Free World policies would work as they were supposed to
                    work.</p>
                <p>When I joined the staff of the Council in 1967, I found that the main topic on
                    everyone's mind was how to win the war in Vietnam. We had some staff members by
                    then who doubted that it could be won. I recall one very earnest officer who
                    came to staff meeting one day with an eloquent “cri de coeur.” We could not win
                    in Vietnam, he said; we were pursuing the wrong policy and should jolly well
                    pull out. He was almost sobbing in his eloquence. But it was to no avail, for
                    long ago we had already made the wrong decisions and had to ride them to
                    defeat.</p>
                <pb facs="0100" n="Page0100"/>
                <p>I plunged into my own project with great vigor. There were many enthusiasts who
                    thought that teaching by television was a great idea. Instructional television,
                    or ITV as it was called to distinguish it from generally informative educational
                    programs, was being experimented on in many places. The general idea was to
                    prepare classroom lectures or lessons at a central point in the school system,
                    then channel it into classrooms by TV. The television set would then, it was
                    thought, practically eliminate the need for classroom teachers. For would the
                    lesson not be better presented on the TV screen? Experiments were underway at
                    such places as Hagerstown, Maryland, in Indiana and Illinois where a plane
                    flying overhead would beam TV lessons down to the schools below, and in American
                    Samoa, where a complete system of telecasting all lessons was in use.
                    Experiments were also going on abroad, in Italy, in Japan, and in some of the
                    countries of North and West Africa. Our education people in AID were deeply
                    interested in all this, but everyone waited for an effective system to be
                    demonstrated.</p>
                <p>I wish I could report that I came up with a dazzling worldwide project to
                    overcome educational deficiencies everywhere by bringing TV lessons into
                    classrooms. Alas, such was not the case. The more I studied ITV, the more
                    deficiencies I discovered. What was most discouraging was that television could
                    not replace teachers, or at any rate not at the existing state of the art. Even
                    in countries like the United States, not much success had been achieved. And in
                    backward countries with poor technical resources, the problems were legion.
                    Teachers complained that presenting the lesson on a TV screen was only the
                    beginning of the teaching process, the part that teachers themselves could do
                    most easily. The hard part was working to get children to understand the
                    lessons, and then to supervise them as they worked over the instructional
                    material, performing exercises and solving problems.</p>
                <p>Television could help; of that much I was certain. But children have to work in
                    order to learn; they can't just have a TV set educate them while they passively
                    look and listen. It was the same lesson I had learned in my shipyard training
                    experience during World War II — that is, that telling isn't teaching. Lessons
                    on a TV screen have to be applied and worked on. So my final report of nearly
                    100 pages discussed ITV at length, with all its strengths and weaknesses, and
                    concluded that the project required further study. We could try out some pilot
                    projects and try to move them, but the time had not yet arrived when TV sets
                    could take over teaching on a national or global scale.</p>

                <p>My colleagues in S/P, as the Planning Council was called in the Department's
                    shorthand, took a lively interest in my project, knowing that were reporting to
                    the President himself. They had a multitude of questions and suggestions, but in
                    the end my paper went over to the White House pretty much as I had written. The
                    most interested individual at the White House was, I am sure, most disappointed
                    in my cautious conclusions. This was National Security Advisor Walt W. Rostow,
                    for I have reason to believe that it was he who had drafted in the first place
                    the President's Williamsburg speech. Perhaps Rostow thought of education in
                    university terms, that satellite television would enable university professors
                    to lecture to the world's classrooms. The trouble was that the problem wasn't on
                    this level, but on that of teaching the three R's to children from 6 to 12.
                    UNESCO figures pointed up the issue; in the poorer countries children dropped
                    out of school without completing the fourth grade, and most remained
                    illiterate.</p>
                <p>Final Months in the Foreign Service</p>
                <p>It was while I was working with the Policy Planning Council that the war in
                    Vietnam reached a critical stage. Our country was pouring vast resources into
                    that unhappy country and still losing the political struggle. General William
                    Westmoreland, an old golfing friend of mine at the Army War College, was doing
                    all that could be done as commanding general, but was unable to prevail over a
                    hostile population. And several of us in S/P doubted that victory was possible.
                    Many years later, after reading many more books on the world political
                    situation, it became my opinion that the first American mistake on Vietnam dated
                    from Woodrow Wilson's ineffectiveness and limited racial views at the Versailles
                    peace conference of 1919. Ho Chi Minh was there as a young Vietnamese patriot
                    begging to have the wishes of his people for independence recognized in the
                    negotiations. But although Wilson professed to believe in the self-determination
                    of nations, he allowed himself to be dominated by Lloyd George and Clemenceau,
                    who had no intention of allowing colonial problems of the Allies to be placed on
                    the Versailles agenda. Imaginative foresight is the rarest of human qualities,
                    and the “statesmen” of Versailles were surely not gifted with it. Nor were the
                    peace planners of the years following World War II. We had another chance then
                    to support the independence of Vietnam and chose the wrong side, directly
                    against the advice of some of our own well-trained Asian specialists.</p>
                <p>In looking back on my experience with the Policy Planning Council I have thought
                    a great deal about how its deliberations could be made to serve the best
                    interests of American foreign policy. The colleagues with whom I served were
                    bright people, and they had as their director an excellent executive in Henry
                    Owen. He had a good mix of people — some Foreign Service officers, some
                    Departmental specialists, some exchange officers from the Pentagon, some
                    individuals borrowed for a year at a time from universities. Outside scholars
                    and specialists from the world of media were brought in periodically to offer
                    their views. But still the Council never did the job as I believe that Secretary
                    George C. Marshall intended, and certainly not as I would wish it could be done.
                    It was continually bogged down in the immediate problems facing the Department.
                    As Secretary Rusk said once to Henry Owen, “I need from your operation ideas
                    that I can use in my daily work.”</p>
                <pb facs="0102" n="Page0102"/>
                <p>What would I wish for the Department's policy planning? I want something quite
                    wonderful and remarkable. I would like to see a staff who were saturated in the
                    study of history and who had some brilliant insights into the significance of
                    our twentieth century civilization and where it is heading. I would like
                    individuals who understand modern history, century by century — indeed, who
                    understand also the histories of past civilizations like those of Rome and
                    Constantinople, of India and China. I would like them to study the entire
                    planet, and to have a vivid sense of the future human predicament. I would like
                    them to have the kinds of minds that Alexis de Tocqueville, Henry Adams, and H.
                    G. Wells had, and in today's world I would like them to think like Kenneth
                    Boulding, like Harrison Brown, like Willis W. Harman, like Lester R. Brown of
                    the Worldwatch Institute, like Bertrand de Jouvenel, and like Aurelio Peccei,
                    who founded the Club of Rome. They would not think just of twentieth century
                    problems, but they would try to envision the twenty-first century and to see
                    what kind of world would be most in the interest of the American people.
                    Harrison Brown and his colleagues at Caltech tried to think a hundred years
                    ahead. Is it too much to ask that the Department of State should create a staff
                    of the most brilliant individuals it can find to do the same for the American
                    government as it flounders in the morasses of a thousand petty problems?</p>
                <p>I regret the lost opportunities of what could have been the most brilliant
                    presidential administration in postwar history, the eight years of the
                    Kennedy-Johnson administration. It should have been a favorable time for
                    constructive thinking and long-range planning if only our country had not become
                    so deeply involved in the Vietnam struggle. There were many extraordinarily able
                    people heading the cabinet departments during these years and many also
                    sprinkled through the government at lower levels. I am happy that we have on the
                    Board of Directors of the World Future Society five of the ablest executives of
                    this period, men who think broadly of the future world.</p>
                <p>Personally I always thought well of Dean Rusk as Secretary of State. Had it not
                    been for Vietnam, much good might have been accomplished under his leadership.
                    He was a broad thinker. “The job of the Department of State,” he used to say in
                    his speeches, “is to try to bring about one kind of future rather than another
                    kind of future.” True, true indeed. But progress was disappointing. Rusk
                    accepted the general view that world communism was a monolithic global movement
                    threatening the Free World. We had stopped the communists in Korea; now we must
                    make a similar stand, he thought, in Vietnam. He thought defensively, too much
                    in military terms. And so did the U.S. Presidents of that era, Kennedy, Johnson,
                    and Nixon. Rusk had some idealistic thoughts about human brotherhood which he
                    might have elaborated, and often used the phrase “the family of man.” But during
                    his term of office the Department of State never came up with any imaginative
                    global plan to promote the better world of which he dreamed — a plan which might
                    have inspired the major part of humanity.</p>
                <p>And as I write this in the 1980s, two decades later, our American leadership
                    seems further than ever from formulating meaningful long-range objectives for
                    our suffering planet.</p>
                <pb facs="0103" n="Page0103"/>
                <p>Retirement at Age 60</p>
                <p>My 23-year career with the State Department and Foreign Service came to an end on
                    March 31, 1968. It was necessitated by a provision in the Foreign Service Act of
                    1946, which I had fully supported, that officers who had not reached the rank of
                    Career Minister, granted mostly to ambassadors, should be retired at the age of
                    60. Personally, I was in excellent health and could have served longer, but
                    there are so many difficulties in Foreign Service life as officers move from
                    country to country, language to language, and culture to culture that I believe
                    that early retirement is a sensible requirement.</p>
                <p>So although I would very much have liked to serve longer with the Policy Planning
                    Council, I was not unhappy to be turned loose to enjoy years of leisure in which
                    I hoped to follow my intellectual interests and engage in a life of research and
                    writing. For family reasons, too, retirement was most welcome, for Ruth's
                    muscular disorder, mentioned earlier, was now more advanced. She had supported
                    my career wonderfully; now it was my turn to become her chauffeur, housekeeper,
                    and personal assistant for a period of six years which ended with her sudden
                    death in 1974.</p>
                <p>Some of my Foreign Service friends have felt at the end of a long career that
                    they received insufficient retirement recognition. But the Department was better
                    managed in 1968 and my own experience was heartwarming. Friends and coworkers
                    showered many attentions on me and staged goodbye parties. The Director General
                    of the Foreign Service, Ambassador John M. Steeves, arranged a formal ceremony
                    for me in the Department's elegantly furnished diplomatic reception area. Many
                    kind comments were made in speeches, to which I responded with remarks
                    deliberately kept light and humorous to make sure I could control my emotions.
                    But I did permit myself one serious moment. I quoted from Tennyson's “Ulysses”
                    some lines of poetry, those in which the poet has the old adventurer say, “Death
                    closes all. But something ere the end, some work of noble note, may yet be
                    done.” For I was determined to keep right on working and studying, and hoped
                    that in retirement I could still produce worthwhile accomplishments.</p>
                <p>Some Reflections on the State Department</p>
                <p>Perspective on a Career</p>
                <pb facs="0104" n="Page0104"/>
                <p>Having spent 23 years in the State Department and Foreign Service and having now
                    been retired from government service for the best part of two decades, it will
                    be my purpose in this chapter to provide some evaluative comment on America's
                    foreign affairs establishment. I did not in my career come into contact with all
                    parts of the home and field organizations, but I do believe that I had an
                    unusually diverse experience upon which to draw in formulating some judgments.
                    In the Department I worked at various times in four different bureaus, while
                    overseas I have had opportunities at various times to visit over fifty American
                    embassies and consulates as well as to serve tours of duty in three very
                    different posts, Stuttgart, Martinique, and Melbourne.</p>
                <p>Let me dispose quickly of my own foreign affairs career — one which I consider
                    variegated with several ups and downs. My most important accomplishments, I
                    think, came at the beginning, when I helped the Department and Foreign Service
                    to get properly structured and oriented for the postwar decades; and also at the
                    end, much less successfully, when I tried hard to get the Department thinking in
                    long-range terms about the kind of world community our country should strive to
                    bring about in the twenty-first century. In between these two periods I did my
                    share of useful work but I doubt that I produced truly noteworthy
                    accomplishments. It was probably a mistake for me to transfer into the Foreign
                    Service in 1952 and to serve ten years overseas, for my foreign assignments were
                    mostly not challenging while in the Department I could have had much more
                    important work to do and more impact on the course of events.</p>
                <p>Do I think that either the Department or the Foreign Service made the best
                    possible use of my abilities, such as they were? No, definitely not. But is that
                    not likely to be the case in any large organization? You are a cog in a machine,
                    striving to do your part. Sometimes you can attract attention with some
                    imaginative initiative and accomplish something worthwhile. Much of the time you
                    simply try to do your own particular work as effectively as you can. The amount
                    of leadership responsibility you are given is subject to chance; a career in
                    government is something of a lottery. It is quite likely that I was just as able
                    as many of the individuals who served above me as Assistant Secretaries of State
                    and Ambassadors. They were given these opportunities and did either well or
                    poorly with them. There was no particular reason why I should have been given
                    these higher jobs, but I am enough of an egotist to think that I could have
                    conducted myself effectively at much higher levels than I attained.</p>
                <pb facs="0105" n="Page0105"/>
                <p>Am I bitter as I reflect on my career? Not in the slightest. I think I was a
                    fortunate person to serve when I did in America's most important government
                    agency and to be allowed to participate in a great variety of interesting
                    activities. The most important job to be done in the modern world is to organize
                    twentieth century humanity for a life of fulfillment of the potentialities of
                    our species. The planet must be better organized politically and better managed
                    socially and economically. Civilization must not only be continued but steadily
                    improved. My contributions toward such objectives were miniscule, but I always
                    had enough imagination to feel that the challenges of our State Department were
                    momentous and that I was helping in my small way to meet them. I found in my
                    twenty-three years of constant effort many personal satisfactions and a great
                    deal of happiness.</p>
                <p>As I reflect back on my government career, it is obvious to me that personal
                    relationships played a major role. I got started as I did in 1945 because old
                    friends believed in me and recommended me and because I happened to hit it off
                    extremely well with Alan N. Steyne, the dynamic young FSO who recruited me. Much
                    of my impact on the Department and Foreign Service in 1946 was due to my
                    friendships with two extraordinary men I have mentioned, Just Lunning and Carl
                    W. Strom. I was able to function successfully in the Foreign Service Institute
                    because I had two wonderful chiefs and some very brilliant colleagues. Later I
                    was rescued from some deplorable assignments in the Foreign Service by personal
                    friends who thought well of me. And I owe my one promotion in 23 years of
                    government service to Max McCullough, my very able chief in the two years I
                    served with the Department's UNESCO Relations staff.</p>
                <p>Where would I have gotten in my foreign affairs career without the help of the
                    many wonderful friends whom I accumulated year after year? It seems to me that
                    every time I dealt with the machinery of government in purely official ways I
                    was treated callously and mechanically as just a hunk of meat, a body which had
                    to be placed somewhere. Because of unimaginative bureaucrats making personnel
                    decisions affecting me, I had several times to struggle like mad to keep from
                    being seriously disadvantaged. The good things that happened to me were due to
                    the kindness and personal interest of individuals with whom I had some kind of
                    human relationship — friends and cordial acquaintances who thought well of me.
                    Without them I could not have functioned; with their help I was able to have a
                    career which I greatly enjoyed and which ended on a high note of
                    appreciation.</p>
                <p>In terms of personal development my foreign affairs years were important to me. I
                    learned about the Federal Government and how it operates; I learned what one
                    must do to become a reasonably successful bureaucrat and diplomatist; I learned
                    a great deal about the complexities of dealing with foreign governments and
                    peoples; and I learned how our own diplomatic organization functions — sometimes
                    wisely, sometimes not. Most important of all, I learned to think in broad terms
                    of the planet Earth, so precious and so abused by mankind, and of our remarkable
                    human species, talented and striving but oh, so imperfect and exasperating!</p>
                <p>Evaluating the Department</p>
                <pb facs="0106" n="Page0106"/>
                <p>The Department of State is an organization of many thousand men and women. The
                    largest single grouping is the six thousand or so who serve in Washington.
                    Several thousand more are scattered among foreign posts in 150 or so different
                    countries. Roughly 1,500 of the employees in my era were Foreign Service
                    officers of career, the FSOs to whom I have repeatedly referred, men and women
                    who have dedicated their lives to foreign affairs and accepted the challenge of
                    serving anywhere in the world where our country needs them. They are a dedicated
                    and selected group, well educated in the colleges and universities of America.
                    These days they are carefully trained by the Department in the skills and
                    perceptions they need. Instruction in speaking foreign languages is a
                    particularly important part of this training. Congress will not permit the
                    Department to require fluency in foreign languages as a condition for entry into
                    the Foreign Service, for Congressmen prefer young college graduates from Podunk
                    Corners to the sons and daughters of the well-to-do with more sophisticated
                    backgrounds. Sometimes visitors are critical because not every FSO at an embassy
                    like the one at Bangkok can speak fluent Thai. But that is an unrealistic
                    objective, since it takes years to learn this difficult but not very useful
                    language, spoken only in one country. My judgment is that the Foreign Service
                    has come a long way in language skills and does extremely well, given the
                    difficulties involved.</p>
                <p>To serve successfully in the Foreign Service our diplomatic and consular officers
                    must be sensitive to the feelings and thought processes of the nationalities
                    with whom they must deal; able to see what is in their minds, and capable of
                    communicating in such a way that a reasonable degree of rapport can be
                    established and capabilities in persuasion achieved. Field officers are governed
                    by foreign policies made in Washington, but they have the responsibility of
                    transmitting to Washington the on-the-spot “feel” of local situations and
                    sentiments. Fluency in local languages is important, and having served in two
                    foreign language posts, I find it difficult to imagine how it would be to work
                    mostly through interpreters or with foreign officials who have learned English
                    or some other language of general communication.</p>
                <p>To serve successfully in the Department of State, one should be a sophisticated
                    bureaucrat who understands organizational rules and situations. He should be
                    sensitively aware of the boundaries of his responsibilities, knowing when he
                    himself must take action, when he should delegate problems to his subordinates
                    to resolve, and when he should defer to superior authority for guidance. Many
                    responsibilities in government are overlapping or conflicting, especially when
                    two agencies or bureaus have very different sets of interests, and a good
                    bureaucrat must know how to deal successfully with such lateral relationships
                    and produce a coordinated result. It can be a complicated and decidedly tricky
                    business.</p>
                <pb facs="0107" n="Page0107"/>
                <p>Having thought always in career development terms I have often meditated over the
                    process of creating well-rounded senior diplomats. In Washington, it seems to
                    me, the headquarters people dealing with the substance of foreign relations need
                    the cross-cultural sensitizing experience of having worked in foreign posts; and
                    equally every field officer needs the broad policy understanding which can best
                    be acquired through working at headquarters. For decades we have been struggling
                    with the problem how to arrange our personnel policies so as to obtain the best
                    result. The perfect solution will very likely not soon be found, but education
                    is an important part of it.</p>
                <p>The State Department's foreign policy functions are very much complicated in
                    Washington by the necessity of working effectively with other executive
                    departments and agencies and with the appropriate committees and subcommittees
                    of Congress. The Department of Defense, representing national military security,
                    has a vital interest in many policies and decisions and is often a particularly
                    difficult foreign affairs partner. In economic matters such departments as
                    Treasury and Commerce are deeply involved, and many other departments have
                    foreign interests. The Department of State is the nation's senior agency in
                    international affairs, but it does not have the kind of firm authority which
                    foreign offices have in many countries and in practice must often defer to other
                    interests. And of course the Secretary of State must always defer to the
                    President and to whatever policy coordination mechanisms are established at the
                    White House level.</p>
                <p>Bearing in mind both the difficulties and dangers in international affairs and
                    the complications of coordinating policy in Washington, how effectively does the
                    State Department function? Such a question will get different answers at
                    different times. One reason is that the Department's leadership keeps changing,
                    and some leaders are better than others. Another is that each election brings to
                    Washington new elected officials — Presidents and Congresses change. The
                    American people also keep changing their views on foreign issues as world events
                    have impact on U.S. public opinion. The Department must continually study
                    opinion polls and the views of leading editors and commentators in order to be
                    aware of important shifts in public mood. So what the State Department can
                    accomplish at any given time depends not only on its own expertise and personnel
                    effectiveness, but on what opinion leaders think, the nature of the public mood,
                    on who has power in the White House and the Congress, and on what Presidential
                    policies are in the ascendancy. And all the time foreign relationships are
                    shifting anyway with the march of events. A gigantic global game is in progress
                    in which the players, the power relationships, and the policies are continually
                    changing.</p>
                <pb facs="0108" n="Page0108"/>
                <p>Under a great Secretary of State, a man of commanding presence working
                    harmoniously with an enlightened presidential administration, the Department of
                    State and Foreign Service will be important instrumentalities and the abilities
                    of talented individuals will count for a great deal. We should think of a great
                    symphony orchestra. The musical product can't be better than the skills of the
                    individuals but it will nevertheless be at its best only when the music of great
                    composers is being played and a great conductor is at the podium. So let us look
                    at composers and conductors, in this case our Presidents and Secretaries of
                    State.</p>
                <p>Six Secretaries of State</p>
                <p>In my years of activity I worked under four Presidents and six Secretaries of
                    State. The Presidents were Truman, Eisenhower, Kennedy, and Johnson. Truman was
                    President at a very critical period when postwar decisions were being made, and
                    it is obvious that a great deal more got accomplished under his leadership than
                    under that of his successors. Eisenhower, it seemed to me, had few specific
                    foreign policy goals of his own. He sought mainly to maintain American positions
                    and calm down international differences. He was not an activist; he presided.
                    Kennedy on the other hand was perhaps too dramatically activist at the
                    beginning; we don't know how much he would have slowed down with the passage of
                    events. His Peace Corps initiative was a valuable one, and his test ban treaty
                    with the Soviet Union was important. Johnson's concept of foreign relations was
                    simplistic; he was not at home in the foreign field and made bad mistakes in
                    Vietnam, trying to accomplish the impossible.</p>
                <p>My six Secretaries of State were Byrnes, Marshall, Acheson, Dulles, Herter, and
                    Rusk. James F. Byrnes inherited in 1945 a weak and confused Department of State.
                    Trained as a small-town lawyer, he had had very little managerial experience and
                    instead of trying to organize the Department of State for its postwar role he
                    attempted to do everything himself, traveling constantly to international
                    conferences and negotiating directly with foreign leaders. Some highly useful
                    beginnings were made in the organizational field, but I doubt if much of the
                    credit accrues to Byrnes himself.</p>
                <p>General George C. Marshall, surely one of the greatest of twentieth century
                    Americans, was a splendid executive, a leader of the highest type. Improvements
                    in the Department which had been started under Byrnes were much further
                    developed under Marshall. The Department prospered under his leadership and that
                    of his deputy, Under Secretary Robert Lovett. Marshall is remembered in history
                    for his Harvard speech which launched the successful Marshall Plan to
                    rehabilitate the economy of Europe, but he had many other achievements, among
                    which were the establishment of a central secretariat in the Department to
                    centralize all diplomatic communication and the institution of a policy planning
                    staff to plan ahead. The Department in two years under General Marshall got
                    rather impersonal leadership, but it was wise and far-seeing.</p>
                <pb facs="0109" n="Page0109"/>
                <p>Acheson's leadership was more personal in character. He knew the Department well
                    after several years in executive positions, was familiar with its strengths and
                    weaknesses, and was a highly effective Secretary. He had the advantage, of
                    course, of following Marshall, who is reputed to have said, in effect, “Retire
                    or replace your older executives and give men from 40 to 55 a run for their
                    money.” This is exactly what Acheson did. I made a calculation once, based on
                    birth dates in the Department's Biographic Register, that under Acheson the
                    average age of the men holding the organization's fifteen top positions was 43 —
                    surely a most astonishing average, for it meant that several Assistant
                    Secretaries or equivalent were still in their thirties. Acheson himself at 53
                    was the oldest, the dynamic leader of a dynamic Department.</p>
                <p>In my estimation Dean G. Acheson, who was not without faults and by no means
                    always right, was the greatest Secretary of State in the history of the American
                    republic. Historians often praise John Quincy Adams, an able and experienced
                    diplomat, but from the modern perspective he was mostly an historical curiosity.
                    The job is infinitely more complex now that the United States is a leading world
                    power. Could a man like Adams, with limited managerial experience, have welded a
                    large twentieth century agency into an effective diplomatic instrument? One may
                    well doubt it. Acheson made some mistakes, of course. One which I particularly
                    regret was appointing his personal assistant John E. Peurifoy to be Assistant
                    Secretary for Administration, a move which I thought had unfortunate
                    consequences. But in general Acheson was well on top of his job. He showed good
                    personnel judgment, delegated responsibilities effectively, communicated well to
                    subordinates, and used his entire organization. In the policy field he had
                    imagination and drive. His leadership was inspiring throughout the Department.
                    History should give him a high niche.</p>
                <p>After Acheson we had John Foster Dulles. I thought him an unattractive egotist,
                    completely lacking Acheson's charisma. He thought of foreign policy in
                    confrontational terms and sought to shore up the Free World's defenses against
                    communism all across Europe and Asia by negotiating pacts and treaties. Perhaps
                    these were useful but my main feeling was that Dulles thought too much in
                    traditional terms, lacked a concept of a future world he wanted to create, and
                    was too occupied with his own ideas to make much use of the talents of others.
                    He was not a good executive, never learning to communicate effectively, and many
                    areas of foreign policy were neglected under his administration.</p>
                <pb facs="0110" n="Page0110"/>
                <p>After Dulles succumbed to illness and had to retire, Christian Herter, a man
                    widely respected, finished out the Eisenhower years. Then came Dean Rusk, chosen
                    by the new Democratic administration of John F. Kennedy. Rusk had headed two
                    different bureaus of the Department in the Acheson years and was widely admired
                    for his steadiness and sagacity. As I commented previously, I thought well of
                    Rusk but regretted his over-concentration on the Vietnam situation. He was an
                    able man who acted always from the highest motives and under more favorable
                    circumstances might have been a truly great Secretary of State. I thought that
                    the Department of State was well-managed during Rusk's eight-year incumbency
                    except for the unfortunate problem of the several hundred Kennedy political
                    appointments — and over which I doubt that Rusk had much if any control.</p>
                <p>As I think back on my six Secretaries of State it is my judgment that Marshall
                    and Acheson were outstanding and that Rusk had more ability than he ever managed
                    to show. But I have to say that I deplore the calibre of our Presidents during
                    the years since World War II. Truman was perhaps the best, ill-prepared though
                    he was for the crucial difficulties he encountered all through his incumbency.
                    Eisenhower always seemed to me a do-nothing President, but perhaps he had a
                    calming influence on the turbulence of his times. Kennedy was hopped-up by
                    dreams of grandeur but might eventually have worked out well. Johnson had
                    impressive abilities but not in foreign affairs. He knew how to get things done
                    politically and some of his accomplishments will endure. Nixon, Ford, and Carter
                    were unimpressive Presidents, though Nixon had some ability and there were times
                    when I thought Carter had flashes of insight into the twentieth century world.
                    My opinion of our present incumbent is so abysmally low that I had better not
                    express it.</p>
                <p>As I look upon the situation of Africa and the world community as they exist in
                    this ninth decade of the twentieth century, I must deplore the absence of a
                    President or presidential candidates with what I would consider an adequate
                    grasp of the predicament of humankind. Like Martin Luther King, I have a dream.
                    And my dream is that in some year not too far ahead, some year still in my
                    lifetime, this great country of ours will produce a leader with a world
                    historical vision. Such a leader, elected to the Presidency, could speak to the
                    American people, tell them where we are in the perspective of world history,
                    analyze for them the nature of our great planetary problems, show them where
                    basic twentieth century trends are leading our civilization, and mobilize their
                    aspirations for a better world by proposing long-range plans and solutions.</p>
                <pb facs="0111" n="Page0111"/>
                <p>If we could discover and elect such a President, a man who could think and speak
                    in world terms of the destiny of man, he could be the leader of the entire world
                    community. For with the huge resources and formidable brainpower of the American
                    people behind him, be could make to other nations cooperative international
                    proposals in which sooner or later most if not all would be willing to join. The
                    toughest, of course, would be the fear-ridden autocrats of the Kremlin, for
                    their emotional mind-set would not easily be altered. But our country could
                    nevertheless become the great world leader and with the right leadership it
                    could show even the Soviet leaders a way to escape from the nightmare of
                    ever-more-dangerous nuclear arms rivalry.</p>
                <p>Some Additional Reflections</p>
                <p>Let me now narrate a personal story about Dean Acheson, dating from 1962 when he
                    was no longer in public office but engaged once more in the practice of law. He
                    and Mrs. Acheson made a business trip to Southeast Asia that year and came also
                    to Australia at the urgent invitation of Prime Minister Robert Gordon Menzies.
                    At this time I was Consul General in Melbourne, and when the Achesons came to
                    our city my wife and I arranged a dinner party at our residence so that
                    prominent local officials could meet the former Secretary of State. When the
                    ladies left the dining room and the gentlemen settled down for some conversation
                    over brandy and cigars, Acheson was asked a question by the Lord Mayor of
                    Melbourne, Sir Maurice Nathan. Would he be willing, the lord Mayor asked, to
                    tell the group about his relations with the new President, the young John F.
                    Kennedy? Of course he would, Acheson replied amiably; no objection at all.</p>
                <p>“The President has been very good to me,” he went on. “He has invited me several
                    times to visit him in the Oval Office, and he has solicited my views on a number
                    of situations in world affairs. When I respond he always listens courteously and
                    attentively to what I have to say. But there is something odd about these
                    conversations. They remind me of some of those which as a young man I used to
                    have with my father, the Episcopal bishop of Connecticut. My father would
                    express his ideas on issues which he thought important, and as I loved and
                    respected my father I would listen carefully to what he said. The trouble was
                    that when we were talking, I didn't feel that my father was living in my world.
                    And when I visited the White House I would go away, time after time, feeling
                    that I, a much older man, wasn't living in President Kennedy's world!”</p>

                <p>This comment by a remarkable man impressed me at the time and has stuck in my
                    memory, stimulating many reflections. One of them is that it seems to me that
                    those of us who try to be thoughtful about great historical trends and the
                    destiny of our civilization are not living in the same world as the men of
                    practical affairs who make political and economic decisions. They have their
                    world; we have ours. I have told how I endeavored, in my last years with the
                    Department of State, to get my colleagues thinking in terms of long-range world
                    objectives. They listened politely; they even expressed interest in my ideas.
                    But they would not really devote much thought to the world of the future in
                    which I tried to involve them, for they had work to do and immediate problems to
                    resolve. I can only guess at what Acheson tried to tell Kennedy, and what
                    Kennedy's reactions were. But it seems to me likely that Acheson was trying to
                    propound a comprehensive world view while Kennedy, an intense young man with the
                    responsibilities and opportunities of the presidency on his mind, was thinking
                    about the immediate actions he should take.</p>
                <p>Another thought that I have is that while it is highly important to have as
                    Secretary of State a man with a thoughtful concept of world affairs, it is even
                    more important to have such a man as President. And yet I doubt that a
                    thoughtful man who is intellectually gifted and highly educated will ever make
                    his way to the White House under our electoral system. Perhaps the best we can
                    hope for is that some future President will surround himself with thoughtful
                    advisers and will make full use of them as his private think-tank, to help him
                    formulate enlightened policies and courses of action.</p>
                <p>What about the State Department as a repository of intellectuality, a place where
                    brilliant minds can function and produce enlightened policies which our country
                    could espouse and seek to implement? My experience with the Department and
                    Foreign Service does not make me optimistic that they will attract and develop
                    the kinds of minds that would be needed for the kind of imaginative think-tank I
                    would like to see. Careers in foreign affairs do not encourage imaginative
                    thinking. The senior diplomatic officer with years of experience who represents
                    the best product of our foreign affairs establishment is a thoughtful and
                    civilized individual with great skills in understanding foreign peoples and
                    carrying out American objectives in the foreign affairs field. I have known some
                    outstanding diplomats whom I greatly respect. But I cannot think of any American
                    diplomatic officer I have known who has impressed me as having an imaginative
                    grasp of the whole modern world scene. The closest example to what I have in
                    mind is the distinguished George F. Kennan, but even he, it seems to me, judging
                    from the many books of his which I have read with rapt admiration, has limited
                    his focus mostly to the Russian-American relationship. I have not known him to
                    articulate ideas of what the United States might achieve as a leader of the
                    world community, dedicated to finding solutions to planetary problems. Perhaps
                    the difficulty is that diplomats who have become deeply immersed in the
                    practical difficulties of international relationships simply cannot envision the
                    very different kind of world that might be achieved by statesmanship looking
                    fifty to a hundred years into the future, a whole quantum jump ahead of today's
                    bubbling cauldron of conflicts and animosities.</p>
                <pb facs="0113" n="Page0113"/>
                <p>Nevertheless, I will say this much — that in my estimation the quality of our
                    professional foreign affairs personnel improved enormously during the years I
                    knew, from 1945 until my retirement in 1968. A great deal of “dead wood” that we
                    had inherited from the pre-war period was weeded out by a combination of
                    attrition and selective compulsory retirement. And there was a systematic
                    improvement of the most promising Foreign Service and Departmental officers
                    which was achieved partly by providing stimulating in-service educational
                    experiences, partly by more enlightened personnel administration, and partly by
                    a new system of promotions in which the record of every officer has been
                    carefully evaluated by high quality Selection Boards who each year spent many
                    weeks at this task. It has made promotions about as fair as is humanly possible.
                    But there is still great room for improvement in the often haphazard system by
                    which Foreign Service officers are assigned to posts and positions, with so much
                    depending on general reputations and who knows whom, favorably and unfavorably.
                    My own experience was not a very lucky one but I still think that personnel
                    administration is better today than it used to be in the old pre-war days when a
                    few powerful officials made all the decisions.</p>
                <p>I would say also that both the Department and the Foreign Service have been
                    getting quite superior human material in the past several decades and especially
                    in the years immediately after World War II. Attracted by the dramatic
                    augmentation of the American role in world affairs, many young people of high
                    calibre came into our foreign affairs establishment at this time, from 1945 to
                    1950. I was in the Foreign Service Institute at this period and observed several
                    hundred young FSO recruits who had come directly out of military uniform into
                    the junior ranks of our newly reorganized service. They were bright, they were
                    imaginative, they were accustomed to accomplishing practical tasks, and having
                    witnessed the tragedies and wastefulness of war they were highly motivated to
                    work for a peaceful world. Watching the recruits of this period develop over
                    subsequent decades I felt that they were the flower of American youth and the
                    best diplomatic officers that our country has so far produced. Most have now
                    completed their careers and a good percentage have justified my high estimate by
                    advancing to ambassadorial positions which they have filled with
                    distinction.</p>
                <p>Because of retiring in 1968 I am not nearly as familiar with the calibre of
                    personnel in recent years. But I helped select some of the FSO recruits in my
                    service as a Foreign Service examiner and in the course of about 200 oral
                    examinations saw many promising candidates. So I am inclined to believe that
                    quality has been well maintained. I also believe that the in-service training
                    experiences arranged by the Foreign Service Institute have been highly
                    stimulating to officers at all levels, giving a good proportion a year off to
                    engage in advanced studies and broadening assignments within the Unites States.
                    Programs in foreign language studies have been particularly valuable and the
                    Foreign Service is impressively better equipped linguistically today than it was
                    in the days when I first knew it.</p>
                <pb facs="0114" n="Page0114"/>
                <p>There is one perennial tendency in the Foreign Service which has always given me
                    concern, and seems to me to require unremitting attention. That is for the
                    brightest and most promising officers to try to avoid serving administrative
                    positions and to concentrate exclusively on work of a diplomatic nature. When
                    that happens, then vital personnel decisions can easily be delegated to some of
                    our less imaginative officers whose interest is not in meaningful personnel
                    development but in just moving pieces on a chess board. Personnel placement
                    officers are under pressure always to please the employing post rather than to
                    provide younger men and women of promise with developmental opportunities. This
                    can work serious disadvantages on worthy individuals who are exploited rather
                    than encouraged to develop.</p>
                <p>It was my observation in my Foreign Service years, reinforced by personal
                    experiences, that those FSOs fared best in assignments and career advancement
                    who early became attached to same particular geographic area — Western Europe,
                    Eastern Europe, the Middle East, the Far East, Africa, or Latin America. An
                    officer of only average ability, having formed friendships in his area, would
                    not infrequently be carried along to one good assignment after another, while a
                    much abler officer without membership in a geographic “tribe” would be many
                    years obtaining the same recognition. There was a special problem for late
                    entrants like me who were neither tribally established nor known for many years
                    of field experience in junior positions. I wanted to specialize in German and
                    European affairs, but when that plan failed I could only take whatever might be
                    available. In short, assignments, the heart of a foreign affairs career, are a
                    great lottery, and the officers concerned with placement are often superficial
                    in their judgments. I have had them say to me, “What's your opinion of
                    so-and-so? What's he really like, aside from all that fluff in his efficiency
                    reports? I want your personal evaluation.” Thus do casual judgments all too
                    often determine assignments. Can the system be improved? Doubtless it can, but
                    no personnel system that the mind of man can devise will ever exclude entirely
                    the chance factors of human likes and dislikes.</p>
                <p>I cannot leave this subject without commenting on the harm done to the Foreign
                    Service by the insistence of Administration after Administration in filling the
                    most desirable ambassadorships with political appointees. No one in the Foreign
                    Service would object to a small number of especially qualified outsiders serving
                    as ambassadors, but to load up the Service with half or more of the chief of
                    mission jobs filled with political appointees does an enormous amount of damage.
                    Not only does this practice destroy the incentive for outstanding FSOs to stay
                    in government service, but it places an extreme burden on our embassies when the
                    ambassador is unable to perform his professional role effectively. And needless
                    to say, appointees with no previous experience in world affairs do the
                    reputation of our country a good deal of damage.</p>
                <pb facs="0115" n="Page0115"/>
                <p>Having said that, I will return to the general question of the capability of
                    Foreign Service and Department of State personnel, I will say that while they
                    attract able candidates at all levels, our diplomatic organization is not one
                    which particularly rewards intellectuals of the calibre found on the faculties
                    of the best American universities. Scholarly knowledge is not valued as highly
                    as are personal charm, tactfulness, and conformity. It is hardly necessary for
                    me to add that I would like to see a higher proportion of imaginative
                    individuals with a broad concern for the future of our world. Such practical
                    skills as speaking foreign languages and establishing rapport with foreign
                    nationals are well-rewarded. Negotiating skills and ability to analyze political
                    trends are important. But my experience does not encourage me to think that the
                    FSO corps is likely to produce the kind of grasp of world historical forces that
                    would make a great Secretary of State.</p>
                <p>When I retired in 1968 I put the State Department and Foreign Service behind me
                    and turned quickly to new interests and new social contacts. Nevertheless, I
                    have glowing memories of my colleagues as being extraordinarily fine men and
                    women, idealistic, patriotic, and capable of outstanding performance. Judging
                    from what I hear these days from old friends and from what I read in the Foreign
                    Service Journal and the Department's monthly journal State, things are better
                    organized than they used to be but morale and dedication to duty may have sagged
                    somewhat. I strongly suspect that the golden years of our foreign affairs
                    establishment were those that I knew in the first quarter century after World
                    War II. But that may be just an old-timer's prejudice, and I shall not say more.
                    I choose to think of myself as a futurist and would rather look forward to the
                    decades ahead than dwell overmuch on those which are past and gone forever.</p>
