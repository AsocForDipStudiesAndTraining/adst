                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is a Foreign Service oral history interview with
                        Ambassador Roger Kirk made under the auspices of the Association for
                        Diplomatic Studies at DACOR Bacon House in Washington, D.C., beginning on
                        May 21st, 1991. The interviewer is Horace G. Torbert. Welcome to DACOR
                        House, Ambassador Kirk, we're off for the first time I know. We're glad to
                        have you here, and I hope you're prepared to give us a little bit of your
                        long and very interesting career.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KIRK: Thank you Tully. I'm prepared in the sense that I'm ready to talk.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I wonder if you would start out and tell us a little bit
                        about how you first got interested in the Foreign Service, or perhaps the
                        right question would be did you ever think of any other career? But for the
                        people not familiar with your background would you tell us anything you want
                        to say about your preparation and education, and first interest.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>KIRK: My family have long been in government service for several generations,
                    mostly in the Navy. I had determined very early on in my life that I wanted to
                    work for the government rather than go into business. The question was then
                    largely what? My father was a career Naval officer, spent some 40 years in the
                    Navy, and that was enough basically to convince me that I didn't want to go into
                    the military. Not that I disliked it; but I just decided that it wasn't quite
                    the life for me. The decision on the Foreign Service came somewhat later. My
                    first brush with international affairs was when my father was sent as Naval
                    Attach� to London in May of 1939, a rather significant date for an American to
                    be going as a Naval Attach�. My mother and I, and my two sisters, went over with
                    him. I remember his being very careful to have my mother pick out a house not in
                    London, but sufficiently away from London so the bombing that he felt was sure
                    to come would not affect that place. And we did. My parents being reluctant to
                    part with me at age eight, I had a governess for the first few months and then
                    went to a British boarding school. When war broke out in September we moved to a
                    larger house in the same village and were joined by two families from the
                    American embassy, the Achilles—he was then, I think, a third or second
                    secretary, something like that in London; and Vinton Chapin. Rudy Schoenfeld was
                    also in the house for a while. The object was for these people to get out of
                    London where it was feared at that time there would be bombing even though there
                    was none at that point.</p>
                <p>After several months in British boarding school my family pulled me out. The
                    school, in the best British tradition, packed all my things without my knowing
                    what was going on. I was called to the head master's office and whisked out of
                    school by my mother. We flew to northern Ireland, she and I, in a DC-3, my first
                    flight, and hers too, I might add. The plane windows were all blacked out. We
                    went to the house of an old aunt where we thought we would spend the war. But a
                    few weeks later we took a ship evacuating Americans from the British Isles to
                    the United States. I don't remember much about that except the excitement of
                    passing through a convoy in the middle of the night on the wide ocean. Our own
                    ship, the United States being a neutral country at that point, was lit up with
                    all lights glowing. To all of a sudden in the ocean come across 50 or 60 ships,
                    none of which had any lights at all and thread your way through them was quite
                    adventuresome, at least for a nine-year-old boy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There was no radar then, I guess, at least on passenger
                        ships.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KIRK: As far as I know there was no radar. It was all done by visual means. My
                    father stayed in England for much of the war in a variety of capacities, ending
                    up as Eisenhower's Naval Chief of Staff in Paris, and commanding the American
                    navel forces in the Normandy landing. My mother was quite cross that she was not
                    able to join my father in late '44 in France because my aunt, Mary Chapin, was
                    able to join her husband who was a Foreign Service officer in France, or North
                    Africa. I've forgotten where they were stationed. I think it was North Africa
                    originally and then he went on into France.</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>In any case, after the war was over, my father came back to Washington in the
                    Navy. His very good friend of, by that time probably almost 30 years standing,
                    Dean Acheson, was Secretary of State. He asked my father to be ambassador to
                    Belgium in early 1946. The reason that was given to me at that point to explain
                    this outside appointment was that the Foreign Service had very few people
                    available for that kind of job at that time. Many of the people in the Foreign
                    Service having gone into military service, the Foreign Service was somewhat
                    disrupted. And of course, with my father's experience in Europe with Eisenhower
                    and the aura of military victory that hung about all the people involved in
                    that, I suppose they thought this would be a good appointment. In any case, he
                    went there and I spent three summers in Belgium, the summers of '46, '47 and
                    '48, out of school and college in the United States.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were just about getting into college at that
                        time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KIRK: Yes, that's right. I entered college in the fall of '47. We did a good deal
                    of traveling in Europe at that time. It was not particularly easy, especially
                    going by car, because the bridges were down, at least in '46. I remember we
                    visited the Normandy beaches. We had to detour for a hundred miles or so to get
                    across some of the smaller French rivers. And we had, of course, to take with us
                    toilet paper, butter, jam, Jerry can after Jerry can of gasoline. I was struck,
                    I must say, by the difference in different countries. England, to my
                    recollection, was the least well off of the countries that we were in, except
                    Germany perhaps. It was certainly much less well off than Belgium. Belgium was
                    relatively well-off. The Belgian Congo had sold uranium and copper to the United
                    States for dollars all during the war. That helped the Belgium economy
                    immensely. Also the front moved through Belgium fairly quickly, and Belgium was
                    the rear area of the front for some period of time. Thus the American soldiers
                    and people spent quite a lot of money there. So the Belgians were doing
                    reasonably well. I remember in Britain the food was terrible. In France it was a
                    bit better. I was struck in our travels to Germany—when we went to Germany my
                    father would, of course, furl the American flag because he was not ambassador to
                    Germany, but he would unveil the plaque that bore his four admiral stars which
                    in the occupied zone of Germany seemed about as good, at least to the MPs.</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>I remember being struck by two things: one, how hard the Germans were working.
                    You could see them picking up the rubble, you could see them out in the fields.
                    They seemed to be working much harder than the French, for example. And also the
                    hostility that one saw, in some of them at least, as they looked at this big
                    black American car going down the road—memories of the war were still very, very
                    fresh. I was able to attend the Nuremberg trial in '46 just for one day. We flew
                    down in the morning, spent the day, and came back in the evening. The city was
                    still full of rubble at that time, and there was the stench of the unburied
                    corpses all around. We went to the trial. I was struck by the fact that a real
                    effort was being made to condemn these men for personal acts against
                    individuals, at least at that stage, rather than for planning of war. Of course,
                    it was fascinating to look at people like Goering, Hess, and the rest. Perhaps
                    the most interesting thing was that I was able to go for lunch with the judges
                    in their chambers. There were eight judges, as I recall, two from each, United
                    States, Britain, France and the Soviets. I was asked did I want to ask a
                    question of the Soviet judge. I think I asked some silly thing. I did not ask,
                    “How does it happen that a Soviet who is representing a government that has shot
                    many of its own people, and its prisoners of war, is sitting here in solemn
                    judgment of the Germans?” That certainly was the feeling that I and many other
                    people had.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At your age, that was quite remarkable that you would have
                        that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KIRK: I'd been exposed to those views. I know that my father was very troubled by
                    aspects of the Nuremberg trials, since he felt, not surprisingly as a military
                    man, that the senior military people should not be tried and judged for
                    performing what they considered their duty to their country. Not shooting
                    prisoners, of course, but carrying out of operations which were perfectly
                    legitimate military operations even though they happened to be on the losing
                    side.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I remember there was a part of the American legal
                        profession that felt that way, too. Another part felt it was the only thing
                        to do.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KIRK: Passions were running very, very high.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's an absolutely fascinating experience to have had.
                        Your father stayed in...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KIRK: He stayed in Brussels for three years. I went up to Berlin in '47 or '48.
                    We, of course, heard many complaints in Brussels about the conduct of German
                    occupiers and others, but I was struck by the fact that our American military,
                    and I suppose civilians, were living in elegant houses owned by Germans which
                    had been confiscated as these people were Nazis or something of the kind. I
                    remember asking one family, “What happened to the furniture?” “Oh, we don't
                    know. It probably went into the fireplace.” This, I'm sure, was lovely antique
                    furniture that was destroyed.</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>I remember there was an organized warehouse where you went as an American with
                    your coffee, or your sugar, and you got points. The Germans came in the other
                    end of the warehouse and brought the family silver, the family porcelain, the
                    rest, and they got points in return. For a few pounds of coffee you could get
                    some wonderful treasures. Of course, that left a rather bad taste in my
                    mouth.</p>
                <p>In any case, in 1949 my father was asked to go as ambassador to Moscow. He had
                    had no Russian experience and we often wondered why he was chosen. I recall that
                    George Kennan had visited three or four embassies a few months before,
                    apparently on a mission to look them over and see who might be best fitted for
                    Moscow. I think it was not an accident they chose a Navy man, that is, a person
                    who is used to keeping up the morale of his staff in very isolated
                    circumstances. Embassy Moscow certainly was isolated at that time, and the
                    techniques used to keep a crew happy at sea are probably somewhat similar to
                    those of being in Moscow.</p>
                <p>My father came back to the U.S. rather unexpectedly in the spring of '49. I had
                    my Easter vacation from Princeton, and I came down and I asked my father why he
                    was back. He said, “It's Moscow.” And I said, “You need an interpreter,” namely
                    myself. This, of course, was a joke because I had taken about four months of
                    college Russian, but he went along with the gag. He was accustomed to take a
                    young man as an aide, an unpaid aide, and he was gracious enough to decide I
                    would fill the bill. This was between my sophomore and junior years at
                    Princeton. So I went with him to Moscow in June of 1949 and stayed there until
                    August of 1950 working at the embassy. It was that experience...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: For over a year.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KIRK: For over a year, yes, thirteen months or so. I just took a year out of
                    college which at that time was considered a rather odd thing to do. I remember
                    my father talking to Harold Dodds, the president of Princeton, to assure that
                    this rather irregular procedure was in fact acceptable to the college, and they
                    assured him that it was. Very few people were going to Moscow at that time, of
                    course.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The experience was absolutely valuable but gave you a
                        personal problem as to which class you belonged to.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KIRK: That's right. I don't know which class to have reunions with.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: If you like reunions, you go to both of them.</hi>
                </p>

                <p>KIRK: My solution has been to go to neither. Anyway, that was a long answer to
                    your question because essentially that Moscow experience persuaded me that I did
                    want to go into Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Also, it gave you tremendous experience. I suppose you got
                        your Russian down pretty darn well by the time you got through the first
                        year in Moscow.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KIRK: Yes. My job there was bossing around the Russian workers who worked for the
                    embassy, carrying boxes of things. Until I told them what to do in Russian they
                    didn't do anything, which was a good way to learn. I didn't learn very educated
                    Russian in many cases, but they made mistakes in their language as often as I
                    did.</p>
                <p>We stopped at the Foreign Ministers Conference in Paris on the way in June of
                    1949. Vishinsky and Acheson, Bevin, and I'm not sure who the Frenchman was, but
                    I remember attending several meals with our delegation and hearing Mr. Acheson
                    and Mr. Dulles and the others talking about it. It was a period when we had the
                    feeling that we had to be very tough with the Russians, that we had to make the
                    best kind of agreements we could. There was still a good deal of uncertainty, as
                    I recall—and I made some notes at the time—in the minds of the leaders of the
                    American delegation as to what the fate of Europe would be, and whether if the
                    economy of Europe went bad, the Communists in fact would take over internally in
                    Europe. There was a lot of concern even though it was after '47. I know that Mr.
                    Acheson was very pleased with some of the progress that he made after he
                    threatened to leave the conference. He said he got something like four
                    concessions in seven minutes after he threatened to leave the conference.</p>
                <p>We arrived in Moscow in late June of 1949, and the Soviets allowed my father to
                    present his credentials on the 4th of July as a mark of courtesy to the United
                    States. One of my first experiences there was when I was out with my mother in a
                    chauffeur driven car in the center of Moscow. The embassy was right across from
                    the Kremlin at that time, where the Intourist is now, on Mokhovaya Square. We
                    could look out at the Kremlin, we could see the parades from the chancery. We
                    drove out from there and were a little puzzled to find, as we looked around,
                    that the streets were being emptied of everyone, except us. Lines of police were
                    moving out from us clearing the streets entirely. It was a somewhat eerie
                    feeling, especially on your second or third day in Moscow. We found out later
                    that the Bulgarian leader, Dimitrov, had died and Stalin was going to march
                    behind his casket through the street. For that to happen, they had, several
                    hours before, to clear everybody off the streets, shut all the windows, close
                    all the curtains to be sure that no one would get within sight or sound of the
                    great leader.</p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>Anyway, as I said, my job essentially was bossing these Russian workmen. We had
                    very little real communication with them about their own private lives. They
                    were simple folk and they were under very strict rules as to what they could
                    say, or not say. They were a rough and ready group and willing to work. They
                    preferred to talk, but they were willing to work. And then during the winter
                    when that work died down, I was translating the Soviet press. Our officers in
                    the political section in those days did not all speak Russian. In fact, very few
                    of them spoke Russian. I would digest articles orally for them from Pravda and
                    Izvestia in the morning so they would know what, if anything, was in the
                    newspapers, which was not very much.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That surprises me. I would have thought by that time the
                        political section would be fairly fluent.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KIRK: Well, we had Dick Davis and John Keppel, both of whom were reasonably good
                    Russian speakers. George Morgan then was not. Dick Service, who was the Far
                    Eastern fellow, was not. Ray Thurston, who was doing Middle East, was not. Wally
                    Barbour, the DCM, didn't know Russian. Of course, my father didn't.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They eventually became somewhat fluent later on. After
                        that year you went back and then came out summers for a year or so, did
                        you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KIRK: That's right. I went back in August of 1950 to my junior year at Princeton,
                    and then the summer of my junior to senior year, that is '50 to '51, I spent
                    again in Moscow.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And then being the son of a military family, you spent a
                        little time in the military service.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KIRK: Yes, I was in the reserve at that time in a prisoner of war interrogation
                    unit, the theory being that as I spoke some Russian, that was an appropriate
                    assignment. But then I volunteered for the Air Force effective upon my
                    graduation from college in June of 1952. It was a question of perhaps being
                    drafted for two years in the Army, or spending almost three years in the Air
                    Force. In the Air Force they told me they would send me to basic training and
                    then to Officer's Candidate School, and then would bring me back to Washington
                    to work on the intelligence side on the Soviet Union. There were very few people
                    who had been in the Soviet Union at that point and they found it useful to have
                    me here. So after whatever it was—nine months—in Lackland Air Force Base, I came
                    to Washington and spent two years working on essentially internal Soviet
                    reporting for the Air Force, political reporting essentially.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you were pretty well trained by the time you got around
                        to taking the Foreign Service exam.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>KIRK: Yes, I took the Foreign Service exam between basic training and OCS. I went
                    from Lackland to Dallas where I had an introduction to some friends of my
                    sister's. I remember the best preparation for my Foreign Service exam, which was
                    then three days long, was having my first martinis in about three months, and
                    living a somewhat more civilized life. My mood was so relaxed I did quite well
                    in the written exam. I didn't have any special graduate training for it but at
                    Princeton I had been at the School for Public International Affairs which meant
                    that I could take history, economics, politics, government, languages, all
                    toward a major. That seemed to be enough in those days to pass the written.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you take the orals then or wait until later on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KIRK: I passed the written in the summer of 1952 and in those days you had to
                    wait at least a year before you could take the orals because of the backlog. I
                    took the orals in early '54 so it was a little over a year. I went into the
                    Service in early '55—April of '55. I must say that my friends in Washington at
                    that point were not at all convinced I was going into the Foreign Service. The
                    theory was that anyone who seemed to be reasonably intelligent and attractive
                    would be going to the CIA, not in the Foreign Service. That was McCarthy
                    time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Thank God there were a few of you that came in this
                        business. What did you take? Sort of a small orientation and then...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KIRK: Yes, I came in the Service and, either before I actually came in, or the
                    first morning I was interviewed by the head of the Executive Secretariat, Jim
                    Byrnes I believe, a civil servant, who said they wanted me to join the
                    Secretariat after my training. My training consisted of two mornings at a town
                    house near the Department where everyone who came into the State Department that
                    particular week, I guess, was lectured about security and such things. There was
                    no Foreign Service officer course at that time. I think it was a period in
                    between. So with the benefit of those two mornings and perhaps one afternoon I
                    went to work in the Executive Secretariat, initially on the publications side,
                    and then somewhat later on what they called the line.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was certainly a good way to learn a lot about the
                        Department fast I would think.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KIRK: Yes. Certainly then, and I think still, service in the Secretariat or in a
                    staff position job early on is key to knowing how the Department works. To get
                    to know people and be known by people, including more senior people, is the best
                    possible way to learn about the Department and to lay the foundation for a good
                    career.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That lasted what? A year or so?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KIRK: That was two years. I had the Middle Eastern desk. In those days we had
                    four people on the line. I handled NEA, economics and a few other things. It was
                    the time of Suez, of course. It was a rather active region of the world.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You spent some nights there probably.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KIRK: I spent some nights there and went on some conferences with Mr. Dulles and
                    the others. Douglas MacArthur was the Counselor of the Department at that time.
                    He was very successful in coordinating a conference. In those days the
                    Department wasn't very good at it. He knew how to get the Secretary's attention
                    to focus on the critical issues. Dulles was not a person to have much patience
                    with focusing on things that were not of very high priority. I've seen him get
                    up and simply leave a meeting when he didn't think it was interesting. I
                    remember being in Mr. Dulles's office at the time he made the decision to stop
                    the funding for the Aswan Dam. It was a small meeting going on and he was
                    receiving different recommendations. One of the most important factors was that
                    Congress was very fed up with the Egyptians, as they were spending a lot of
                    money on buying arms from the Soviets. A leading Senator had written a letter
                    saying they were proposing, and it looked as though it would pass, to put in a
                    provision in an aid bill saying that no money appropriated by Congress could be
                    used for assistance to Egypt, or for the Aswan Dam. To some extent therefore, at
                    least as it appeared to me, Dulles's hand was forced. After hearing the various
                    recommendations he did end discussions saying, “Well, I think we should decline
                    to fund the Aswan Dam.” Then he looked up and for the first time, or the only
                    time I saw him look a little thoughtful, and say, “That's a pretty important
                    decision.” He left the room for a few minutes, I assume to talk to the
                    President. That decision, of course, then led to a good deal of excitement
                    during the summer.</p>
                <p>I was getting a briefing book ready for Secretary Murphy in about a hour and a
                    half—two hours—when he went over to London in the early summer—during the
                    summer, I forget early or late—I guess it must have been the early summer. We
                    had received word, or had some indication that the British and French might be
                    planning to take some military action and he was sent over to try and talk them
                    out of that, which he did at that time. I was part of the Secretariat and
                    delegation going to the London-Suez Canal Users Conference in August.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was a Dulles creation, wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>KIRK: This was a Dulles creation. It was designed essentially to get the Suez
                    Canal users together; to tell the Egyptians that they couldn't, they didn't know
                    how to run the Canal. The Egyptians had nationalized the Canal by this time. The
                    idea was they didn't know how to run the Canal and the users would boycott or
                    come out in some way to prevent the Canal from being useful to the Egyptians.
                    The Indians were the big opponents at the conference. We spent a lot of time
                    getting papers ready for Mr. Dulles to use. I spent most of my time back at
                    delegation headquarters, I was the junior of two or perhaps three officers in
                    the Secretariat there. I was working the hectograph machines...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You earned your pay.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KIRK: We earned our pay the way we reproduced things in those days, a very messy
                    business. When I got word that my presence was wanted at the conference, I put
                    on my coat and went over there. I was ushered into a room—a fairly small room
                    where a great many distinguished people were sitting including the Secretary,
                    Assistant Secretary Rountree and others—and stood at the door and Mr. Dulles
                    motioned to me to come over. I had no idea he knew who I was even. He sat me
                    down next to him and said, “Gentlemen, this is your new Secretary General.” I
                    looked just as surprised as I was. They had decided apparently to send a mission
                    to Egypt under Australian Prime Minister Menzies, a five power mission, to in
                    effect give Mr. Nasser the conclusions of the conference, and to talk him out of
                    keeping the Canal. Mr. Dulles wanted the U.S. to play a fairly minor role, and
                    the British and French and others wanted us to play a fairly major role. We were
                    one of the five powers represented. Loy Henderson was our representative. But
                    they wanted an American Secretary General. I don't know, but I guess we resisted
                    it and finally Mr. Dulles acceded but by appointing a Foreign Service officer,
                    aged 25, with about a year and a half experience in the Foreign Service. It
                    became very clear that this Secretary General was going to be the servant of the
                    commission, not the leader of the commission. So I went to Cairo, pulled
                    together some staff, and got some funds. We were down there about a week. During
                    that time it became perfectly apparent that Mr. Nasser could run the Canal, and
                    he wasn't about to give it up. The commission then left Cairo not having
                    accomplished its mission but at least having been fed, and housed, and
                    transported by yours truly.</p>
                <p>After the Secretariat I went to Rome.</p>

                <p>KIRK: I was told that I was going to go to NATO so my wife started studying
                    French at FSI. We had two small children; one was two and one was one. She was
                    pregnant with the third but she thought French would be good and the FSI was
                    offering it for spouses on a space available basis. Then about two-thirds of the
                    way through the course I called her up and said, “No, we're being sent to
                    Italy.” And she said, “What do I do now?” I said, “Keep on learning French.”</p>

                <p>KIRK: I inquired about language study and was told there was no time or funds, so
                    I took 18 hours of Berlitz at my own expense. We arrived in Rome—Betty having
                    been out of the country once on our honeymoon, and once on a grand tour with her
                    family—myself, having been out a good deal—arrived in Rome with our two small
                    children in the middle of the summer at the Pensione Villa Borghese where they
                    spoke no English whatsoever. It was hot, it was close down by the road.</p>

                </p>
                <p>KIRK: I remember thinking this was awful, but our Italian got a lot better fast.
                    There I was the junior member of the political section working exclusively on
                    external affairs, foreign relations. The Italians, of course, as you well know
                    Tully, were sharing with us some reports from their embassies in Sofia and
                    Tehran—their diplomatic representation. I would go down and pick up those
                    despatches, translate them, or excerpt them, and send them back to
                    Washington.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As a result I think they got to use our embassy in
                        Tehran.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KIRK: They did, but I think it was you, Tully, who told me that you had prevented
                    that from being...</p>

                </p>
                <p>KIRK: Rome, as third secretary, was very nice in that there were plenty of
                    counselors of embassy, not to speak of DCMs and ambassadors, but plenty of
                    counselors of embassy, including you, to take care of all the social
                    responsibilities, so that we were relatively free to do what we wanted, to take
                    care of our small family, to see something of the countryside, and of course to
                    mingle with the Italians as best we could but it was very...</p>

                </p>
                <p>KIRK: There was that, and we formed friendships there amongst the junior officers
                    who stayed our friends.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was a wonderful place to be. Let's see, Niles Bond was

                <p>KIRK: Niles Bond was the Political Counselor, Earl Sohm was my immediate boss,

                </p>
                <p>KIRK: Jernegan was the DCM and then Outerbridge Horsey came in. Zellerbach was
                    the Ambassador. When my wife had a baby I remember Mrs. Zellerbach sent her a
                    little sweater, which was very sweet. It was a huge embassy. It was a very nice
                    touch, one which I think is something to be borne in mind by senior officers or
                    ambassadors in large places—a little gesture is often very much appreciated.</p>
                <p>I didn't know her much, but you may recall, Tully, it was Matilda Sinclair, a
                    political officer or whatever you called her — social secretary—at the embassy,
                    who certainly told myself and my wife what to do at receptions, where to go, and
                    where to stand. There's no nonsense about it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You came back to the Department for a while after

                </p>
                <p>KIRK: I said I would like to go into Soviet affairs, perhaps for obvious reasons,
                    and I remember getting a message from the Department—I suppose it was an airgram
                    in those days—saying that Soviet training was filled up, but they'd like to
                    teach me Bulgarian. I noted that we had no embassy in Bulgaria, and hadn't had
                    for some years. Was this really something they thought was a good idea? And the
                    answer was, when I got back to Washington, that they had a Bulgarian language
                    tutor. They needed at least two students per year in order to keep this tutor on
                    and therefore they wanted to have two students.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And the other one was a military guy.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>KIRK: Probably. We went off on home leave to rest up for this rigorous Bulgarian
                    language training, which my Russian had presumably helped in, though I had the
                    thought it might have helped with Russian even more. I got a call from Mac
                    Godley, who was then working as a special assistant for Freddie Reinhardt, who
                    was the Counselor for the Department. Mac said he was leaving and he wanted me
                    to take his place. I told him that I had this problem of Bulgarian language
                    training; and he said, “Don't worry about that.” Mac was much senior to me, he
                    was probably a 2 and I was a 5 in ranks in those days. But he and Freddie seemed
                    to think my Secretariat experience and all was enough for the job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Freddie was very young for his job; he had the rank, I
                        guess, but in terms of years...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KIRK: So I went down to the Counselor's office after about two weeks of home
                    leave and unfortunately Freddie got sick and I went back for four more weeks of
                    home leave. The principal responsibility we had there was coordinating the
                    President's trips abroad. This was quite a new thing. During the summer, before
                    I came on, Eisenhower had traveled to western Europe. Other than Roosevelt's
                    wartime trips that was the only trip abroad a President had made except for
                    Wilson. We, as I say, became the coordinator for Eisenhower's trip out to Italy,
                    Turkey, Greece, India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Morocco and Spain over the course
                    of 10 or 12 days. And then another trip a few months later down to Latin
                    America. I was assigned as the principal State Department officer of the advance
                    party. Jim Hagerty, the President's press secretary, and his appointments
                    secretary, Stephens, and Colonel Walters, his pilot...</p>

                </p>
                <p>KIRK: A plane full. It was also my first jet plane ride. I was sitting on a couch
                    in the front part of the cabin when we took off and the plane went up so fast,
                    and the wheels came up with such a bang, I thought the tail had hit. I looked
                    around very nervous but everyone else was very relaxed. But in any case, my job
                    essentially was to explain this phenomenon of a White House visit, and the White
                    House advance party, to the embassies, and embassies to the White House party.
                    And neither one of us knew each other very well in those days, or perhaps
                    since.</p>

                <p>KIRK: Right. He was en route to Taiwan. That was for the Pope's funeral. Mrs.

                </p>
                <p>KIRK: Phyllis Bernau was late for the Secretary's aircraft. Do you remember
                    that?</p>

                </p>
                <p>KIRK: Only one person the Secretary would wait for and that's Phyllis.</p>

                </p>
                <p>KIRK: Even those advance trips were a very fascinating exercise. General Walters,
                    then Colonel Walters, was the interpreter. He went along with us.</p>
                <p>

                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>KIRK: Then after a few months—I guess it was only a few months, less than a year
                    in any case, working in the Counselor's office, I was asked to work as a staff
                    assistant in Secretary Herter's office. He was then the Secretary of State, so I
                    moved over there replacing Bill Scranton as a matter of fact. Scranton was a
                    political appointee and did very different things than I did. I was still on the
                    junior staff, Max Krebs was my immediate boss. I spent a little over a year
                    working for Mr. Herter in that office until the change in administration.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Herter was pretty sick himself, not sick exactly, but he
                        was crippled—could move easier some days than others—but still, of course,
                        was very sharp mentally.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KIRK: We moved from what was then called New State, from the old part of the
                    building to the new part of the building, the Secretary's office. I remember him
                    saying as he pushed open the door of his new office, “It takes a strong man to
                    open that door.” And one of the secretaries who had been there a long time said,
                    “It takes a strong man to be Secretary of State,” which he was in
                    character...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I wasn't one of his close associates, but I... Were there
                        any substantive things of that period that you remember particularly? You
                        still lopped over into the Kennedy administration, didn't you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KIRK: Well, until the evening of January 19th. One of the interesting things
                    while I was in the Department in that job was how the flow of business to the
                    Secretary's office tailed off as the month of December ended and January came
                    along. It was also interesting to see some who had been very friendly with, and
                    respectful to Secretary Herter, become less and less so at the time of
                    administration change. The better people, of course, did not. But you could sort
                    of sense power moving. The Secretary asked me if I wanted to be recommended to
                    Secretary Rusk as one of his people. I said I thought I had spent enough time in
                    the staff aide business by that time, and it was time I did something on my own,
                    with which he agreed. I then went down to work for Soviet Affairs.</p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>During Herter's time we did basically the regular business. One exciting morning,
                    I think it was a Saturday, when the U-2 went down...I know that Hugh Cumming, as
                    head of INR, and Bohlen as the Soviet man, and a bunch of others were in and out
                    of the office all day. I guess the President was away and there was a lot of
                    debate as to what action to take about the U-2. There was a cover story that it
                    was all by accident that was put out routinely. Then the question was, do we
                    admit that it was something that we did on purpose, or do we in effect say it
                    was something the CIA had done on its own. The predominant opinion at that point
                    and the recommendation, when the party got back, was to say that it had been
                    authorized. The feeling being to have the President deny responsibility, or say
                    it was someone else's fault, would lead to a Soviet feeling that he was quite
                    irresponsible, he did not have control over the covert warriors in the
                    administration. And that this would be more disturbing for world peace than for
                    the President, in fact, to say yes, I did order it. But there was a lot of toing
                    and froing in and around the office that day. And as I say, the decision at that
                    point was to go with the cover story at least until they could be in touch with
                    the President and decide how to play it—which was two or three days later. The
                    cover story being that it was a weather plane that had lost its way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I remember. I was in Europe. That was a little earlier,
                        wasn't it? It was '60 I would have thought, early '60.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KIRK: Yes, because the administration ended in January '61, so we're talking
                    sometime in 1960.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As a matter of fact I was in the office of the CIA station
                        chief in Athens at the time. We were just perhaps winding up with your
                        travel duties and with your Secretariat duties. Is there any more on that or
                        do you want to go on?</hi>
                </p>

                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>KIRK: Yes, after the meeting in Secretary Herter's office I went down to SOV on
                    the public affairs side. That is preparing press guidance. I did that for a
                    little over a year, worked for David Klein who was the head man for the press.
                    Then he went over to the NSC staff with Mac Bundy. I then took over that job. It
                    was Jack McSweeney who was office director. Dick Davis was the Deputy Assistant
                    Secretary. Of course, we started at the beginning of the Kennedy administration.
                    The basic marching orders were that there was going to be a new look at
                    American-Soviet relations, and it was going to be a good deal more positive than
                    it had been under the Republicans. Some of us, myself included, were a little
                    skeptical about this. The words were somewhat more positive, but the degree of
                    positiveness became strained by such things as Cuban Bay of Pigs, and then the
                    Cuban missile crisis.</p>
                <p>I had not been involved in the Bay of Pigs business when I was working for
                    Secretary Herter, but I knew there was a project going on. People were dealing
                    directly with him, not going through the staff aides.</p>
                <p>Then I went off to Garmisch-Partenkirchen, the Russian area and language training
                    facility run by the Department of the Army for their people. Its part of their
                    so-called fast program which involves a year's study at Monterey, a year's study
                    at an academic institution, two years at Garmisch, a year of further training,
                    and then you're ready. That was the fast program. The Department of State had a
                    somewhat different version—you had nine months at Garmisch and then went to
                    Moscow. It was excellent training because you were supposed to have a working
                    knowledge of Russian before you went to the school. The military had a years'
                    training beforehand. All of your class discussions, your term papers, your
                    reading was all in Russian. You lived it in the language for eight or nine
                    months. When I first went, even though I'd spoken Russian pretty well, I had not
                    used it for eleven years hardly at all.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And that's a language you forget.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>KIRK: And I had forgotten a good deal. I could still read pretty well, and
                    understand reasonably well, but speaking was very difficult, coming up with
                    anything. We had a grammar exam at the beginning and I put together the
                    declension and conjugation tables by remembering various songs in Russian. Every
                    time I would come to a word I knew what the word was. If I could ferret which
                    case it was in, I'd fill in the ending for that word, and that gender in that
                    case, like a crossword puzzle. It was very good training in terms of the
                    instructors who were there, who were all people who had operated in Soviet
                    society. It was in Europe originally because these people came out of the DP
                    camps. Most of them had backgrounds that made them totally ineligible for entry
                    into the United States— members of the communist party, members of the police,
                    members of the Army. But that was fortunate, of course, and what made them
                    valuable. That experience was very fine. That included two bus trips into
                    Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union; one the northern route and into Moscow, one
                    the southern route into Romania, Bulgaria, Turkey, Yugoslavia. That was in the
                    fall of '62 and the spring of '63. It gave me my first taste of what we then
                    called satellite countries, the basic message from that trip having been that
                    the countries in Eastern Europe were quite different even then, in their
                    character or their outlook, from each other. Some things that have become very
                    apparent today.</p>
                <p>After the year at Garmisch, or Oberammergau—we lived in Garmisch and went to
                    school in Oberammergau—we drove to Moscow, myself, my wife, our four children
                    and a nursemaid in a mid-sized American station wagon. We drove up to Stockholm,
                    over to Helsinki, and then down into Moscow, the objective being to reduce to
                    the extent possible the amount of time we were driving behind the curtain in
                    case of any accidents. We arrived safely and well.</p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>I was assigned to the consular section for my first year in Moscow, and the
                    political section the second year. Two weeks after we arrived there was the
                    signing of the limited test ban treaty in Moscow for which the Secretary of
                    State and a variety of other dignitaries arrived for the formal ceremonies.
                    Betty and I, even though very junior, were assigned to Senator and Mrs.
                    Fulbright, he then being the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee,
                    to take them around Moscow and show them what was there. I, of course, as I say,
                    had been there a total of two weeks though I had been there in 1949 and 1950. I
                    quickly learned that the thing to do when asked, “What's that building?” was to
                    give an answer even though I hadn't the foggiest notion, because to say, “I'm
                    sorry Senator, I've been here two weeks, I don't know,” was highly
                    unsatisfactory. Whereas if one said, “Post and telegraph,” or “Ministry of
                    Agriculture, Ministry of Industry,” he would forget immediately, as we all
                    would, and they came away at least satisfied that the embassy knew. So we did
                    that, and we went with the Fulbrights up to Leningrad, and enjoyed their company
                    very much I must say. They're both very fine people. He already at that point
                    was struggling with the question of the relative balance between giving large
                    amounts of assistance abroad and the needs of his home state of Arkansas and
                    places like that in the United States. It was interesting to see this great
                    internationalist's mind at work trying to balance these different priorities.
                    For my mind, who always the thought internationally primarily, it was an
                    interesting insight into the other side of the use of our resources. Not to use
                    them just for foreign aid, because we had a real obligation to our own people.
                    There are some very poor places in our own country.</p>
                <p>The Consular Section in Moscow was a reasonably routine place. There was a consul
                    and two vice consuls. My tour there was enlivened by the fact that it was during
                    that time that we negotiated the consular convention with the Soviet Union. I
                    was chosen by the Political Counselor, Mac Toon, to be his assistant in that
                    respect. So the better part of that year we went once or twice a week to the
                    Foreign Ministry to negotiate that convention. I was essentially preparing the
                    papers and listening while Toon and his opposite number on the other side spoke.
                    His opposite number was the deputy legal advisor of the Foreign Ministry, Oleg
                    Khlestov, who interestingly enough was my opposite number in Vienna as
                    ambassador to the UN organizations there some 20 years later.</p>

                        the Foreign Service that you have known these people.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>KIRK: Absolutely. Those contacts you think you won't see them again but you do
                    time and again, your own people, your own nationals, but especially foreigners.
                    We often swapped tales about that time. We were at the interesting position—we,
                    the Embassy; and we, the Department of State—of wanting maximum protection for
                    our consular officers and personnel in the Soviet Union, recognizing full well
                    we then would have to give maximum immunity to Soviet consular and personnel in
                    the United States, something the FBI and others were not at all enthusiastic
                    about. So we had a dual negotiation going, one with Washington, and one with the
                    Soviets. We and the Soviets, to some extent, being on the same side in the
                    question. They, of course, wanted maximum protection for their people. The
                    negotiation went quite well. We were nearly done and our ambassador, Ambassador
                    Kohler, was about ready to go back to the United States on a visit. The
                    Political Counselor and I thought that it would be nice if he could go back with
                    this agreement concluded, or at least initialed. So we told the Soviets we'd
                    like to finish within two or three weeks. And immediately they began to
                    stonewall. They obviously felt we were under some pressure to conclude the
                    agreement. They went back on some of the suggestions that they had made, and it
                    took us a full six months of simply— well, not quite that much—let's say three
                    months of simply showing no interest in these meetings whatsoever, making no
                    phone calls, before we could get back to where we had been.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But this is great training.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KIRK: Absolutely. And to tell the Soviets that all we wanted to do was give our
                    ambassador something nice when he went home, of course was totally rejected by
                    them as unworthy of consideration as a reason. But I've often thought of that.
                    If you seem to be under pressure, they, or maybe some others with whom you
                    negotiate, will immediately up the ante.</p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>Two other things in the consular section. There were a number of American
                    Armenians, some of whom came from the Soviet Union, from Armenia, in the 1930's,
                    or '20's, or even before. Some of whom were born in the United States to the
                    people who had come out during the '20's or even a little earlier. They had gone
                    back to the Soviet Union. In 1945 one shipload went back, and in 1947 another
                    went back. They went back in response to the Soviet propaganda they were
                    building a new Armenia and the sort of euphoria of the post-war alliance. And
                    once back there these people were never allowed to leave even though many of
                    them were American born citizens. And during the time that we were there—that I
                    was there in the consular section—the first one of these was allowed by the
                    Soviets to make contact with the embassy. I remember one of the most rewarding
                    moments of my life was reissuing American passports to an Armenian family who
                    had gotten Soviet permission to leave, and could leave as Americans and come
                    back to the United States. It was not easy because the Department queried as to
                    why they had not been in contact with the American embassy all these years if
                    they were so anxious to come back to the United States. We reported that one had
                    tried and spent ten years in prison as a result. We thought that was a little
                    too high a standard; it was quite a disincentive. So the Department eventually
                    relented and, of course, since then thousands of these people have come out.
                    Even under Stalin's time they preserved their American customs, they played
                    baseball, they preserved their knowledge of English. They did some really quite
                    heroic things in that sense, and that was nice.</p>
                <p>The only other thing, I suppose, of any eventfulness was we had one of these
                    prisoner swaps where we were exchanging a Soviet spy for someone the Soviets had
                    alleged was a spy, or someone they had held for many years. And there was a man
                    called Father Ciszole. Father Ciszole had been taken prisoner by the Soviets in
                    the early '40s I suppose. There was one person in Soviet Affairs...Virginia
                    James, who remembered Father Ciszole. No one else seemed to know him, as they
                    had come to SOV long after he'd been taken. And when the time came to look for
                    two people to swap with the Soviets—one was obvious, I've forgotten who he
                    was—and she said, “How about Father Ciszole?” So sure enough we put his name on
                    the proposal for the exchange. The Soviets were quite puzzled but eventually did
                    find him out in Siberia somewhere. He has since described how he was on his 20th
                    year, or 15th year in Siberia when he got word to come to the camp office, was
                    given a new set of clothes, a shave and a haircut, and was told he was going to
                    the United States—to his total astonishment.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just because one lady...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>KIRK: Just because one lady remembered his name. Otherwise he never would have
                    gotten out. We realized at that point how dependent we were on the local staff.
                    We had to prepare the American visas, and in a couple of cases American
                    passports, for these people without the local staff knowing. This whole thing
                    was very hush- hush, and it was very difficult to find the seals, find the
                    ribbons, knowing where to sign, just the mechanics of getting things together.
                    We were, as I guess most of us are, totally dependent for that kind of clerical
                    help in the consular section. I often thought of that when I heard the Soviets
                    had denied the locals access to the embassy from one day to the next. The
                    consular section in Moscow must have been in a hell of a mess, along with
                    everybody else.</p>

                </p>
                <p>KIRK: And, of course, some of those locals had been there for many, many years.
                    There were a couple who had been there when I was there in 1949 and were still
                    there. They knew very well what was going on.</p>

                </p>
                <p>KIRK: Oh, I think so, and there is no way that you can keep a consular section
                    where you have visitors come, where you have people actually come to get there
                    visas, no way you can keep it free of bugs because anyone can come in to get a
                    visa and plant a bug under a chair. I'm a proponent of the theory that you have
                    certain areas of the embassy, or certain buildings, that are free from locals
                    getting in. I think that is a good idea, but in the consular section, the USIA
                    library, or residences, you don't try to keep them out, and you accept the fact,
                    or at least the hypothesis, that everything you say is being listened to.</p>

                        was your ambassador the whole time you were there, wasn't he?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>KIRK: Foy Kohler was our ambassador the whole time we were there, and he was
                    actually DCM in Moscow up until the time my father came to Moscow. Just
                    coincidentally, there was a change of DCM as well. I, therefore, had seen the
                    Kohlers for a couple of days in '49. But during the period I was in Moscow from
                    1963 to 1965 Kohler was the ambassador. I thought very highly of him. He was a
                    very good person to work for; he was very fair. You knew that he would stand up
                    for you, that he would demand good performance, but that if you did good
                    performance, that would be reflected in your record, and that if for some reason
                    there was some mistake, then he would stand up for you. I made some stupid
                    mistake in a note to the Soviets and it could have been trouble but he took full
                    responsibility and backed us up wholly. And in the consular convention business
                    he was a tower of strength. Very approachable, very human and humane person.</p>
                <p>The second year in Moscow, I was in the political section working on external
                    affairs, Soviet-American relations basically, but also Soviet relations with
                    Middle East and Africa—I can't remember now; Soviet-American relations
                    primarily. I was also the travel officer, which meant I assigned myself as many
                    trips as possible. That, of course, was one of the most fascinating...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had a priority to keep the traveling going.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KIRK: We worked very hard to keep the travel going. You always had to have two
                    people going, and you were occasionally looking for someone to go along with an
                    officer. And I had traveled a good deal even in 1949 and '50. I think it's very
                    important in that kind of country, where you're very isolated from people, to
                    get out, because once you're outside the capital city, you have a little more
                    chance to talk to people. The Soviets, at least in those days, would not
                    necessarily give you a compartment by yourself even though there were two of you
                    traveling. The compartments were for four people, and there would often be two
                    other people in the compartment, not necessarily KGB people—sometimes they were,
                    but not always. And in the course of several days on the train that you would
                    often spend, you got a chance to chat with people. So it was very rewarding.</p>

                <p>KIRK: Oh, nothing really spectacular. I suppose at the time that we created the
                    most trouble with the Soviets quite unknowingly, was when shortly before my
                    departure from Moscow in 1950, the first time I was there, I had said to my
                    father that I really wanted to see Siberia before I left. He agreed that that
                    was a fine idea, and he would like to as well. So my father, Dick Service, who
                    was our Far Eastern specialist, and myself, took a trip on the Trans-Siberian
                    just as far out in Siberia as we were allowed to go. It was on the shore of Lake
                    Baikal, a small village called Sluydyanka. And then we turned around and came
                    back for about a day and a half or two days on the train until we came to a city
                    where we were allowed to change to an airplane. We spent over a week on the
                    train going out and several days coming back. When we arrived back at the
                    airport in Moscow, the DCM, Wally Barbour, met my father with the news that
                    North Korea had invaded South Korea a few hours before. And I often thought of
                    the Soviets trying to figure out why the American ambassador to Moscow, for no
                    apparent reason, suddenly took it into his head to spend a week on the
                    Trans-Siberian just when they were moving supplies and things for the North
                    Korean invasion of South Korea. But when I think of the trains we must have
                    derailed, and the schedules we must have thrown out of commission, it was quite
                    a trip.</p>
                <p>On Moscow then, the second time that is, in the mid-'60s, what else does one say?
                    Oh, yes, Khrushchev fell during that period. The embassy did not expect it to
                    happen, and we did not have foreknowledge of it. When people ask me about that,
                    I say, “That is certainly the case,” but I also point out, “that Khrushchev
                    didn't know either, and that his sources of information should be somewhat
                    better than ours”—the American embassy's.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's a good answer.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KIRK: We tried to go to museums, the day after he was thrown out because we
                    wanted to see if the museums were being changed. Sure enough they were all
                    closed. Finally one of our officers raised some charwoman in the museum and
                    said, “Why is it closed? It is supposed to be open today.” And she said, “Don't
                    you know the government's fallen, they're working on the pictures.” And sure
                    enough, by the time the museums reopened, Khrushchev had been brushed out of the
                    various pictures and other people substituted. That's the way things operated in
                    the Soviet Union.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All that is fascinating. Well, I think probably we better
                        be...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>KIRK: Close it up? One final point on Moscow would probably be enough. One of my
                    jobs in Moscow was to mingle with—it was Vietnam time, we were starting to bomb
                    Vietnam—and the Soviets were organizing demonstrations outside of the embassy.
                    We wanted to get some sense as to what the mood of the demonstration was. So I,
                    because my Russian was fairly good I suppose, and because I was doing
                    Soviet-American relations, was elected to be the person to go out and mingle
                    with the demonstrators. So I would put on my borrowed Russian hat and put on my
                    overcoat and go out and mingle with the crowd. I came away with two or three
                    conclusions. First of all, what the embassy security people said, that is to
                    say, “the best defense is to show no sign of life in the embassy whatsoever,” is
                    absolutely correct. Because when you're outside and people were throwing stones
                    at an embassy, if someone sticks their head out and yells at you, it simply
                    incites the crowd. It gets a dialogue going, it gets them excited. It's much
                    better to present a completely impassive face, if a window breaks, a window
                    breaks, that's just too bad. The crowd was quite orderly, but reasonably
                    enthusiastic about seeing how many windows they could break, who could throw the
                    furthest. I carefully should add, truthfully, I did not throw a stone, tempting
                    as it might have been just because of the enthusiasm of the moment. But no one
                    bothered me. I'm sure the KGB knew I was there and were watching. Someone did
                    come over one time and said, “Where did you get those shoes? They don't look
                    like Russian shoes.” And I said, “I got them abroad,” and moved away. There was
                    no real hostility towards me.</p>
                <p>In the final demonstration the Chinese students at the Soviet University joined
                    by prearrangement. They were much less docile than the Russian students. They
                    actually tried to run through the police lines and there were some ugly moments.
                    A water cannon truck was brought up. I remember I was quite close to this truck
                    when it came up. It was interesting to sense the mood of the crowd change as
                    this truck came up. They became much more hostile. The driver was a very
                    friendly, personable, outgoing guy. He leaned out of the window and kidded with
                    people, and joshed with them, and defused this potentially difficult situation.
                    They never used the water but again one got a sense as to how the mood of a
                    crowd could change. The Chinese, as I say, were somewhat obstreperous, and the
                    Chinese then made a big fuss later about the Soviets having beaten up their
                    students. That was the last demonstration. The outrage of the Soviet people
                    against American barbarism stopped suddenly. But the reason, of course, was that
                    the Soviets were having trouble controlling the demonstration. They were always
                    very wary about demonstrations.</p>
                <p>Anyway, so much for that Moscow interlude.</p>

                        Kirk by Horace G. Torbert, at DACOR Bacon House on May 28th, 1991. Well,
                        Ambassador Kirk, welcome back on this hot steamy Memorial Day and maybe a
                        typically Saigon day too.</hi>

                </p>
                <p>KIRK: No, I think there are lots of things there but that's probably the place to
                    stop.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you want to say something about how you got to New
                        Delhi, and then go on and talk about New Delhi?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KIRK: Sure. Ambassador Bowles, then the American ambassador to New Delhi, came to
                    Moscow on a visit. I later found out that he had talked to Ambassador Kohler
                    about his desire to have someone with Soviet expertise in New Delhi. And between
                    the two of them they had decided that I would be the person, and so quite
                    irrespective of anything that I might have said or done as to where I wanted to
                    go, I was told that New Delhi was the place for me, which I was quite pleased
                    at.</p>
                <p>I left Moscow in July of '65, came back on home leave, and was scheduled to go
                    out to New Delhi in September of '65. An Indo-Pak war broke out at that point
                    and our departure was delayed about a month so we lived in the Alban Towers, had
                    some tutors in for the kids, and went off to New Delhi in October. In New Delhi
                    I was in what was called the external section. Ambassador Bowles said you could
                    not separate politics from economics and that, therefore, instead of a political
                    section and an economic section, he had an external section and an internal
                    section. Of course, you can't separate internal from external either, but it was
                    an interesting experience to be a political officer. I think it's something to
                    think about in the sense that it gives the political officer, like myself, more
                    of a feeling for the importance of economics and vice versa. My particular beat
                    was Indo-Soviet relations, at least initially. Then I took up bilateral
                    relations, and then Indo-Pak for a while. But my primary function was Indo-
                    Soviet relations. They were quite important at that time. Of course, one of the
                    great changes I noticed going from Moscow to New Delhi was that you could drive
                    your car wherever you wanted, that the sun shone all the time, and that every
                    Indian politician wanted to tell you all about his plans for the future. The
                    information overload was quite a contrast to the very small bits of information
                    we got in Moscow, requiring of course a different approach to political
                    reporting.</p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>The only real taste I got of the Soviet Union in India was when I went down to
                    visit the Bhilai steel works. Anyway, I went down to visit this Soviet built
                    steel mill in the central part of India. When I arrived and walked into this
                    hotel, the immediate Russian smell greeted me. The food was all Russian, the
                    signs were all in Russian. It was a little Russian colony, plus me for those two
                    or three days when I visited the mill.</p>
                <p>In India, basically, I guess I was impressed by the extent of the American
                    program, the American presence there, but how small it seemed in comparison with
                    the extent of India. What a small drop in the bucket it was in a way. India, of
                    course, is immensely impressive by its size and all the rest—I won't go into
                    that. The most, I suppose, dramatic thing that happened to me while I was there
                    was when Stalin's daughter defected in New Delhi. That story has been told
                    extensively so I need not repeat it here except to say I was sitting quietly at
                    home having my supper when I got a call from the station chief in New Delhi to
                    say, “Could I come down to the embassy right away please.” So I went down
                    wondering what was up, and when I arrived he said, “We have someone here who
                    claims she's Stalin's daughter and wants to defect.” And I said, “What? I don't
                    believe it. It's some kind of prank.” I mean if it was someone else's daughter,
                    but Stalin's daughter. We had no idea that she was in New Delhi, certainly no
                    idea that she wanted to defect, but she'd come in about 7:00 p.m. and shown the
                    Marine her passport.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had you ever seen her before?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KIRK: I had never seen her before. I knew that there was a daughter, that's about
                    as much as I could contribute. I did not even know that she had an Indian
                    husband who had died. She had come back to spread his ashes on the ground. But
                    during the course of that evening, after some deliberation, we decided that even
                    though it might well be a put-up job, that what we should do, or recommend to
                    the ambassador that he do, was process her expeditiously, but legally, for exit
                    from India and entry into the United States.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You didn't have to smuggle her out as you would have in
                        Eastern Europe.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>KIRK: There was consideration of that, but we didn't want it. In fact, the CIA
                    had arranged some at least unobtrusive ways to get her out. We really thought it
                    might be a Soviet provocation, or an Indian one, and we didn't want to be
                    caught. As it so happened I went to the airport with her later that evening,
                    along with the CIA man, and we told her she had to process herself out just as
                    an ordinary person. She comes of strong stock and she did that. Planes come and
                    go in India at 2:00 - 3:00 o'clock in the morning so it was about midnight when
                    we went out, or 11:30. She processed through in her own name, it was Alliluyeva,
                    which nobody recognized at that time, of course. Alliluyeva would be the correct
                    way to transliterate. In any case, she processed herself through using her own
                    passport, and we sat in the airport waiting lounge, and then, of course, were
                    told the plane was an hour and a half late. So we sat around quite nervous and
                    finally I said I thought we ought to order some tea and look a little more
                    normal. We were expecting the Indian police and the Soviets to arrive at almost
                    any second, bursting through claiming we had kidnapped her, and all the rest.
                    One of the more difficult moments came when she said she'd like to go to the
                    ladies room. “Of course.” She disappeared and I thought, “We'll never see her
                    again, or she'll come out in a KGB uniform, a KGB colonel, or something.” But
                    she reappeared looking somewhat relieved, and we sent her off.</p>
                <p>The ambassador took on his own responsibility issuing her a visa to enter the
                    United States. This enabled her to get on the plane and get out. In the event
                    she was stopped in Rome and sent up to Switzerland. But the advantage of getting
                    her out fast, the reason we did that, was that we were sure that the Indians
                    would not be able to resist Soviet pressure if we tried to hold her and then get
                    Indian permission to send her out. By far the best thing, not only from her
                    point of view, but from the Indian point of view, was to take her out before
                    they realized that she was missing.</p>

                        Going back for just a minute to that steel mill unless you are going to do
                        it later. I remember having heard quite a lot about that from some of my
                        Indian colleagues and what great people the Soviets were, and what louses we
                        were for not having given them a steel mill. It was obviously a very useful
                        propaganda ploy, and very useful psychological thing, but was it an
                        economically sound thing, or not.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>KIRK: No. The mill, which by the way, was Bhilai, I now remember. Our people who
                    knew a lot more about those things than I did said it did not make a great deal
                    of sense, that it produced low quality steel with about the same labor cost as
                    would have been done in the United States, for example. Each individual was paid
                    much less, but they used many more people. On the other hand, in fairness, the
                    Indians did not have to spend foreign exchange for that steel. So it certainly
                    was a propaganda advantage for the Soviets and I think it may have been of
                    marginal...in fact, it probably was of economic utility for the Indians. The
                    Soviets then offered, and indeed were proceeding to build a much larger mill,
                    Bokaro, which was clearly unnecessary and a real white elephant.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And was that the end of your...did you ever hear from
                        her?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KIRK: I had a postcard from her, not addressed to me by name because she did not
                    know my name, but a postcard addressed from her, saying 'thank you', and then
                    some mention in her book. Then Chester Bowles in his book did mention my name
                    which I was a little concerned at because I thought this would mean that the
                    Soviets would think I was in the CIA, which I was not. But it didn't seem to do
                    any real harm. It was kind of amusing in that the person in the Soviet embassy
                    who was responsible for staying in contact with me on the KGB side, as opposed
                    to the political side, was also her caretaker, and he had made the mistake of
                    giving her a passport the day before she was supposed to leave which enabled her
                    to leave legally.</p>

                <p>KIRK: In another direction, and his relations with me afterwards were quite
                    strained.</p>

                <p>KIRK: Oh, sure. They have a file on me so long. I guess the only other thing I
                    might mention that was somewhat out of the ordinary was our trip up to
                    Sikkim—you went to Sikkim?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, no, I've never been in India actually, I've been in
                        Pakistan but I was never...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KIRK: Well, Hope Cooke who married the Chogyal of Sikkim, is a cousin by marriage
                    of mine, and she very nicely, and her husband, invited our whole family to come
                    up to Sikkim, so we did, my wife, myself, and our four children, for about a
                    week. We flew up to Bagdogra, and then by train up to Darjeeling, and then by
                    royal jeep into Sikkim, all of us in one jeep with the royal crest on it. That
                    was the only elegant thing about it practically. We had a very interesting time
                    up there. It was the Chogyal's birthday, I believe, and there were all kinds of
                    ceremonies with the old customs and horns, and all the rest. The interesting
                    thing to me was that his palace—he was the ruler of Sikkim—his palace was on the
                    second highest hill in Gangtok. The residence of what had been the British
                    representative, and now is the Indian representative, was on the highest hill,
                    and it was perfectly clear what the order of precedence was. There were a couple
                    divisions of Indian troops on the Sikkim-China border, and they also had an
                    obviously controlling hand in Sikkim if they wished to. But Hope and her husband
                    were trying to increase the evidence of Sikkim's independence, the outward signs
                    of it. She and a niece of mine had designed the national flag, and I think
                    helped write the national anthem, and a couple of other things. But it was
                    clearly a remote, old fashioned place with the real problem being that the
                    Nepalese were starting to outnumber the Sikkimese, and the Nepalese were not so
                    keen on the Sikkim royal family continuing to rule that place. And that allowed
                    a way for the Indians to come in and make trouble and eventually in effect
                    replace the Chogyal.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Indians have taken over entirely now? Or is there
                        still a degree of autonomy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KIRK: There's very little real autonomy now, if any. Not nearly as much as even
                    the limited autonomy that there was. Its under very tight control at this
                    point.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You worked for a very well known and somewhat
                        controversial figure in the Foreign Service. Would you like to say something
                        about Ambassador Bowles, his strengths and weaknesses. He's certainly a
                        wonderful man, and a very interesting one. There have been debates as to
                        whether he had real good judgment—political judgment.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>KIRK: To my mind—well, one thing about Ambassador Bowles is that he managed to
                    attract around him a remarkable group of people. Of his special assistants, one
                    became head of AID, one became head of the Peace Corps and governor of Ohio, one
                    became head of AIPAC, the Israeli PAC organization. Of the external section that
                    I mentioned of about five or six of us, I think four or five have become
                    ambassadors at least once if not twice. So he was able to identify, and bring to
                    his staff, a very remarkable, a very highly talented group of people—that was
                    one thing. He took the advertising man's approach to diplomatic reporting. In
                    other words, he had a product to sell, namely Indian-American relations, and he
                    advertised his product—he advertised it to the hilt, because he believed that
                    was the way you accomplished something in Washington. People used to say 60 to
                    80 percent of his reporting was discounted, but the remaining 20 percent was
                    enough to at least cause our friends in Pakistan immeasurable grief. And I think
                    that one could argue whether in the end he accomplished more by that than he
                    would have by straight objective reporting, a larger percentage of which would
                    have been credited. I've always favored the objective reporting myself but the
                    other is not ineffective.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is a fairly common thing to happen to a first time
                        diplomat who becomes an ambassador right away, not always, but I had a
                        gentleman named Korry up in Addis when I was in Mogadishu...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KIRK: What is it they say? “Where you stand is where you sit.” I think personally
                    Bowles was much better as an ambassador than he was as an Under Secretary. He's
                    not a great man for detailed bureaucratic paper, one who moves the paper
                    quickly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's hard to see all the interests and give them a proper
                        weight.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KIRK: Certainly that's true. But he was certainly an interesting person to work
                    for, and the Indians, of course, loved him, partly because he was such an
                    enthusiastic supporter in Washington. But it was not easy at that time because
                    India was not very popular because of its nuclear position.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there what about five years, or two and a half,
                        something like that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>KIRK: Just a little over two years. I was minding my own business in the
                    political section, and one fine morning a telegram came in saying I had been
                    assigned to Saigon. This without any advance word whatsoever. And I would very
                    much have preferred not to do that since I had four small children, and was
                    still fond of my wife. I thought they could find enough people for whom neither
                    was true to send to Saigon. But I had really no alternative but to accept on the
                    grounds that if you're in the Foreign Service, unless you have a really good
                    reason, you have to go where they send you. This was in early November-late
                    October, and I managed to get them to agree I would leave after Christmas, so I
                    moved to Saigon the 27th of December of 1967.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then, as usual, I suppose they said, “What? You here
                        already.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KIRK: Well, no, actually they did seem to need me at that point. There was a
                    small unit within the political section that was responsible for North Vietnam
                    watching, and I was heading that unit. The reason, I guess, I was sent there
                    really was because of my experience in the communist world. One of my first
                    impressions in Saigon was at a New Year's eve party that I went to—this is New
                    Year's eve of 1968—where I would say almost all of the top people of the
                    embassy, and even from the provinces, were present. It was a very good party but
                    I'd just been three days ago in New Delhi, as I mentioned, and I was really
                    stuck by the fact that these people were going to remake Vietnam. They were
                    going to get rid of all the corruption, they were going to win the war, we were
                    going to make a democracy out of it with a House of Representatives, a Senate, a
                    Supreme Court. The whole thing was going to be very neat and tidy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All was going to be democratic, I suppose.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KIRK: Exactly, and it was all very high and noble ideals, but as I mentioned,
                    India is sort of the grave yard of men's hopes and you learn a good deal of
                    humility in India, even as an American, about your ability to change things. I
                    must say at that point, I had considerable doubt that we could accomplish all
                    that, praiseworthy as it was. Of course at the time Tet a month or two later, it
                    became apparent that we could not.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ambassador Kirk, we were just talking about Vietnam, and
                        you were talking about the Tet.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>KIRK: In those days spouses and families—then usually referred to as wives and
                    families—were not allowed to be with you in Saigon, but for American holidays
                    the spouse, not the children, were allowed to come in. The Vietnamese proposed
                    that this should be done for Vietnamese holidays. Well, therefore, some spouses
                    were allowed to come in for Tet, including my wife who came over from Delhi
                    leaving our four children with their grandparents. In any case, there was a good
                    deal of rumbling during the night, but the Vietnamese celebrate such holidays by
                    massive explosions of firecrackers, and I told my wife that was all it was.
                    Well, we woke up the next morning to no phone calls, no phone working, and the
                    radio saying that Saigon was under attack. I said I obviously had to go up to
                    the embassy so I set off in my grey pinstriped suit walking up through the
                    center of the city, up towards the embassy. No one was on the streets, of
                    course, and a few blocks from the embassy I saw an American tank with a bunch of
                    soldiers around, and a major came over to me and said, “What are you doing?” I
                    said, “I'm going to my office at the embassy.” And he said, “There are Viet Cong
                    all over that place, go back.” So I did, and returned to the embassy later that
                    day when it became apparent that the Viet Cong had in fact been cleared out.</p>
                <p>In Saigon, certainly, we had the impression, and in the country we had the
                    impression that Tet was a military defeat for the Vietnamese in the sense they
                    committed their undercover South Vietnamese National Liberation Front forces,
                    and did not achieve a major victory, or anything like the victory they'd hoped
                    to achieve. On the other hand it was quite clear that Tet was a tremendous
                    victory for them in the United States, where the decisive theater of the war was
                    as it turned out.</p>
                <p>After Tet and the move towards the Paris peace talks, my unit of the political
                    section was charged with backing up the Saigon side of the peace talks. What
                    that consisted of essentially was doing the staff work for a series of meetings
                    between Ambassador Bunker, his deputy Ambassador Berger, the political
                    counselor, first Arch Calhoun and then Martin Herz, and President Thieu, Vice
                    President Ky, the Foreign Minister, and a note taker on the Vietnamese side. So
                    the four of us—I was the note taker on the American side—would go to these
                    meetings once or twice a week with those four individuals to whom we were
                    presenting the kinds of concessions that we thought the Vietnamese should at
                    least consider to get the peace talks moving. This, of course, is a very early
                    stage in the peace talks. The concessions were nothing like as great as the ones
                    that eventually had to be made. But Thieu, whatever else you could say about
                    him, was a master of diplomatic negotiation and technique, and he gave virtually
                    nothing away. He listened with great politeness to everything Ambassador Bunker
                    had to say, but committed himself to virtually no concessions whatsoever.</p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>One of the interesting things to me, during this several months really of
                    meetings, was to see how Thieu downgraded Ky's status during the process of the
                    negotiation. At the first meetings Ky would be in Thieu's office when we came
                    into the waiting room. When we would be ushered in to join, they were obviously
                    talking together. A little bit later, we could see through some translucent
                    curtains the figure of Ky going into Thieu's office just a moment before we did.
                    Still later Ky was in the waiting room with us. Of course, in the oriental world
                    this was a dramatic symbol of his decreasing status in terms of the power
                    situation in Saigon. And, of course, Thieu and Ky were very different people. Ky
                    was a very flamboyant fighter pilot type; Thieu was much more quiet, oriental
                    appearing, much less accessible to Americans, and much more clever at
                    bureaucratic maneuvering.</p>
                <p>In any case, these talks went on for some time, and we then began to get into the
                    layers upon layers of classification, or sensitivity we had. The messages on
                    these talks had one special classification. Then it developed there was a second
                    series of messages that were coming in with another level of classification on
                    the same subject. And this, as Vietnam went on, was just added to more and more.
                    So you had circles within circles within circles that were only dimly apparent
                    to us working in one of the circles at the time.</p>
                <p>I guess what really struck me about the embassy operation there was that we had
                    almost no contact with the Vietnamese. My feeling was that we knew little about
                    what was going on, really, in Vietnam. We had this contact with Thieu and Ky,
                    that was special, but with the people we had very little really and it was
                    difficult to move around the countryside in many cases. It seemed to me we knew
                    less about the Vietnamese than we had about the Indians, and knew less about the
                    Indians than we had about the Soviets. We knew less about the Soviets than we
                    had about Italians. As you move east somehow it becomes more and more difficult.
                    Well, the cultural gap is greater and perhaps not unnatural.</p>
                <p>Another thing of interest to me in that Vietnamese experience was that almost
                    everyone had a program of action that they were following: be it pacification,
                    military victory, economics. The tendency was very much to report successes for
                    the program for which you were responsible. I think that was one of the reasons
                    that the reporting got badly skewed, and it did get badly skewed, I believe,
                    even though most people are certainly honest. There was one small unit in the
                    political section called the provincial reporting unit which had two officers
                    for each of the four corps areas of South Vietnam. These young men would go out,
                    observe, and then write reports. And they had no responsibility for any program.
                    Their reports were much more pessimistic than those of the military and the
                    civilian—civilians who were program administrators.</p>

                <p>KIRK: I just honestly don't. There are people who are now quite prominent in the
                    Service who were some of these reporting officers. Dave Lambertson was one.
                    These were all very junior officers and partly for that reason some of their
                    reports were discounted. Partly they showed the indignation and surprise at
                    corruption that you might expect from a junior American officer. That tended to
                    leave people to give less weight to their reports than they might otherwise have
                    done. It was sort of as if they were discovering the real world, that they were
                    a little bit too idealistic. But I must say, I thought as a whole they gave a
                    better picture of what was going on than almost anyone else. They were
                    inconvenient, these reports, because they did vary with what was going out. That
                    part of the political section was abolished shortly after I left, not because I
                    left, but shortly after I left which I always thought was too bad.</p>
                <p>I guess that's really all I need say about Saigon except that there were an awful
                    lot of good people there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, they certainly had their pick of people almost, such
                        as you.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KIRK: There was no question, you got the word and off you went.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Bunker there most of the time? Or was he away a good
                        deal?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KIRK: Bunker was there most of the time. He occasionally went to Nepal to visit
                    Carol Laise, his wife. He was there almost all the time, and he, as you know,
                    was an immensely conscientious person, always available, long hours, a wonderful
                    person to work for, of course.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I remember the Italian Foreign Office thought he was the
                        best guy that had ever been in Italy up until the time I left anyway.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KIRK: I first met him really when I was in New Delhi in connection with the
                    advance trip for Eisenhower's visit that I mentioned earlier on the preceding
                    tape. I was really struck that Bunker welcomed us into his office, the eight, or
                    ten, or twelve top people, if you will, on the advance party, along with his
                    embassy people. He took off his coat and said, “Let's go to work,” and proceeded
                    to give the kind of personal direct attention to the Presidential visit that it
                    required, which not all ambassadors did. And Bunker already by that time was a
                    very distinguished ambassador. In Saigon he was always kind and thoughtful and
                    wise.</p>
                <p>I think it was hard for the American establishment at the embassy, and indeed
                    later in Washington—or at the same time in Washington—to accept how tough the
                    North Vietnamese were, and how determined they were. Again, our reporting of
                    that subject was not terribly much welcomed in Washington.</p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>After Vietnam I came back to Washington to work in Bill Sullivan's office—right
                    outside his door—as a kind of special assistant, albeit not with that title.
                    Bill was the Deputy Assistant Secretary in what was then known as FE, Far East,
                    now EAP, for Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia. And I spent a couple of years, as I
                    say, with him. Bill at that point reported in the capacity of Deputy Assistant
                    Secretary to Secretary Rogers, and he reported as deputy head of an NSC
                    committee on Vietnam to Henry Kissinger. And as a mark of his diplomatic skill
                    he managed to do both without offending either. We would have meetings twice a
                    week of people from the Pentagon, from AID, from CIA, from the White House, and
                    from State, to coordinate the sort of senior working level activities on
                    Vietnam. Not that we were making the policies certainly, much less myself who
                    was sitting there as kind of factotum and note taker, and facilitator. Not that
                    policy was being made there, but to be sure that the implementation of the
                    policy was coordinated and was moving ahead smoothly. I knew that work quite
                    well.</p>
                <p>It was interesting to me to see the interplay of...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was called the Vietnam Working Group, was it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KIRK: The Vietnam Working Group was actually the Vietnam desk. This was called
                    something else, Vietnam Task Force, or something like that. The director of the
                    Vietnam Working Group was a member of this ad hoc body that coordinated things.
                    He represented the State Department, if you will. He, unlike Bill Sullivan, did
                    not have a NSC hat, which Bill did. For example, if a paper were wanted on
                    various withdrawal scenarios, we would produce that as part of this group. If we
                    had to coordinate messages of various kinds going out to Paris, or going out to
                    Saigon, of an inter-departmental nature that didn't have to be done at the
                    Secretary level, then we would do that. Of course the interesting thing in those
                    meetings was the interplay between what was happening in Vietnam, what was
                    happening in Paris, and what was happening in the United States. Different
                    people reporting on different aspects of this and trying to keep all this in
                    mind—at this point it was essentially managing the withdrawal of the United
                    States from Vietnam. Nixon was already President, and it was clear that
                    withdrawal was the name of the game. It was a question of how fast, under what
                    circumstances, and what kinds of negotiating techniques. The negotiations, of
                    course, the real ones, were being handled by Kissinger in the White House but
                    John Holbrooke (?), his assistant for those things, used to come over. Although
                    he did not share with us what was going on, he knew what was going on.</p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>As I mentioned, if we were asked to do papers for the NSC, then we would
                    coordinate the production of those. And here again in this circles within
                    circles I remember coordinating two papers simultaneously. One paper was close
                    to the real paper. I was involved in that. That was a small group. Then there
                    was a larger group that was doing another paper that was not witting of much of
                    the material that went into the first paper. And I'm sure that there was a third
                    paper of a yet higher level that was where it really mattered. I think to some
                    extent that was Dr. Kissinger simply keeping everybody writing papers and not
                    getting in his way. Though to his credit I think that he absorbed more of the
                    detailed studies than most NSC members, or Secretaries of State.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was a fantastic character, there's no question about
                        that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KIRK: He is a fantastic character.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It is not right to speak of him in the past tense, because
                        he's very much around.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KIRK: I must say again, as a member and sometimes chairman of those
                    inter-departmental meetings, it was extraordinary the difference in the power of
                    the State Department representative after Henry Kissinger moved over to the
                    State Department then before he was there. All of a sudden the people around the
                    table were much more deferential because at that point Kissinger also retained
                    the title of National Security Adviser. So as a State Department representative
                    you could say, “I will appeal it to the National Security Adviser,” who also
                    happened to be your boss. This is particularly important in dealing with the
                    Pentagon because they were often quite difficult on some of these things. I
                    remember being taken over there for a very long briefing about how it was
                    absolutely physically impossible to move our men out in more than a year and a
                    half, or something like that, even if the President ordered it immediately,
                    something that I expressly did not believe.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They hadn't heard about operation Desert Storm yet.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>KIRK: That's right. Moving troops and equipment out in an orderly way is
                    difficult. Moving them out as fast as possible is much less efficient. But there
                    another thing that was of interest to me was that an analyst—who for these
                    purposes had best remain nameless, I suppose—in INR, the Bureau of Intelligence
                    and Research, who was writing what I thought was some pretty good stuff on the
                    North Vietnamese, particularly how tough they were and how they weren't about to
                    give up. He was not able to get his material out through his front office, or
                    even through his directorate in INR because it was going contrary to regular
                    wisdom. He used to give me copies of his drafts, and I would give them to the
                    NSC staff. That was the only way that we got this material to at least the NSC
                    staff. I doubt very much if they showed them to President Johnson but at least
                    they knew what a responsible analyst thought. And he was then fired from INR. We
                    managed to get him a job as it so happened on the NSC staff. But the willingness
                    of people to accept information contrary to their preconceptions is very
                    limited.</p>

                <p>KIRK: Yes, yes indeed.</p>

                    was plenty.</p>

                <p>KIRK: But I think also the idea of teaching people who were presumably going to
                    go ahead in the Service, giving them the opportunity to really learn about the
                    United States, is very important. We were able, as I'm sure you were in that
                    operation, to go places and do things and talk to people that no ordinary
                    citizen or even extraordinary citizen of the United States could do.</p>

                <p>KIRK: Which is also good but a little different. Because our focus was very much

                </p>
                <p>KIRK: Yes, I was asked to be deputy assistant director in the Bureau of
                    International Relations of ACDA. That bureau was essentially responsible for
                    backing up, and to some extent staffing, our delegation at what was then known
                    as the CCD, the Committee of the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva, now known
                    I believe, as the CD, Conference on Disarmament in Geneva. The conference of a
                    group of 24, I think it was at that point, nations, which focused on controlling
                    chemical weapons, biological weapons, nuclear tests, all that kind of
                    multilateral arms control. Not the bilateral stuff, but the multilateral stuff.
                    They had meetings twice a year, each one lasting two and a half to three months.
                    During the really just one year that I was there, the main focus was chemical
                    weapons. A biological weapons treaty had just been signed. The main focus was
                    chemical weapons, plus a little discussion about comprehensive nuclear test ban,
                    a little discussion of conventional disarmament but not much. There was
                    essentially no progress made during that time. I suppose the only thing to be
                    said about that was the degree to which in those days we and the Soviets, known
                    as the co-chairmen of the committee, essentially ran the committee. It was clear
                    that nothing could be done unless we agreed that it be done, and it was also
                    pretty clear that if we agreed something was going to be done, it was going to
                    be done, albeit that took a little time sometimes. In fact it seemed to me that
                    the principal benefit of that organization at that time was to be able, if you
                    will, to multilateralize a bilateral U.S. and Soviet agreement on nuclear
                    nonproliferation, on biological weapons, potentially on chemical weapons. But
                    nothing was ripe at that point and we spent the time essentially arguing with
                    each other.</p>

                <p>KIRK: Remember we were not—well, we weren't really in the strategic arms
                    negotiations. We were in the bilateral arms negotiations. We weren't counting
                    missiles and warheads and things like that. In fact, START negotiations did
                    begin while I was there, and we did have two people on the staff that were just
                    starting to get involved in the START negotiations. That is a practically
                    life-time study. But chemical weapons, at least in those days, was...there were
                    obviously technical parts, and we had some technical people, but the essential
                    issues were comprehensible. You had to learn a little bit about things such as
                    precursors, the things that you use to make a chemical weapon, and the things
                    you use to make the things you use to make chemical weapons. One of the issues
                    is, where do you have the cut-off, where do you start regulating? It becomes
                    quite difficult, and technicians argue about that. But they could pretty well
                    demonstrate the ways that you would go about regulating chemical weapons if you
                    wanted to. But at that point it wasn't clear that the Soviets wanted to. So that
                    was essentially a holding operation, my first real experience in multilateral
                    conference work, albeit, as I say, it was largely trading statements, but I got
                    some sense of what it is to try and bring around other people to your point of
                    view—other nations.</p>

                    the time, wanted to see me. I went up to see him and he told me that very seldom
                    in his particular job did he have to give people good news, but he wanted to
                    tell me that I'd been selected to be the Department's nominee for ambassador to
                    Somalia, to my total surprise. I wasn't of a high enough rank really, and
                    certainly not old enough, at least in those days. I was the token youth, I
                    think. Then I had never been in Africa, and only had a reasonable approximation
                    of where Somalia was, if the truth be known. But that was very exciting, and I
                    remember coming home and telling my wife we were going to Africa, and seeing her
                    face fall. But I said, “But as ambassador,” and she looked at me in total
                    disbelief.</p>
                <p>The reason for that was, I think, some knowledge of Italian many years back, some
                    ability to demonstrate an ability to operate in difficult countries because
                    Somalia in those days was a close friend of the Soviets, and the rules for the
                    Americans in Somalia were very much like the rules for Americans in Moscow or
                    any one of the Iron Curtain countries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this among the really bad times, or did it become a
                        little bit better?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>KIRK: No, but by this time...I was told about this in April let's say, and
                    actually went out to Somalia in October I guess, I can't remember exactly, '73.
                    And at that time the Soviets were definitely Somalia's best friend. We were not
                    allowed to travel more than 40 kilometers outside the city, Somalians were not
                    allowed to come to our embassy, and relations with the Somali government were
                    quite distant. We had no Peace Corps, no AID program.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you do while you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KIRK: Not a great deal to do except to try and keep up the morale of the very
                    small staff, and to report the best we could on what was going on. I remember
                    Tom McElhiney, who was then quite senior in the management side, and who had
                    been ambassador in Africa, telling me when I went up to see him, “Now, Roger,
                    remember that you are in a small place. If you decide you want to send a
                    telegram to Washington, take a swim. If, when you come back from the swim, you
                    still want to send a telegram, then send it.” I always thought that it was good
                    advice. “Don't bother Washington too much,” albeit, it was true that the Soviets
                    had use of the facilities in Berbera, and there was a certain amount of interest
                    in what was going on in Somalia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At that time we closed up Hargeysa, which I opened up by
                        the way.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KIRK: Did you?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How many people did you have?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KIRK: We were down to a very small operation, and the situation got, if anything,
                    a bit worse during my time there. My predecessor, Matt Looram, had left quite
                    quickly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was all rather nasty.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KIRK: His wife, a Rothschild, had been not only threatened, but an assassination
                    team had come in that we felt was targeted against her, so she was evacuated
                    immediately, and he was shortly thereafter. So when I got there—my wife is not a
                    Rothschild, I was about to say, “I regret to say,” but let's see how that
                    actually works out, I don't mean it that way. One of the Somali guards used to
                    sleep in front of the gate when we went in, and when we went out, and the whole
                    rest of the day and night. He was left over from the security threat there had
                    been.</p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>It was essentially, if you will, a holding operation. In fact, I was in the
                    stadium when a Soviet visitor, I think it was the Prime Minister, I can't
                    remember now, came. It was announced that the Somalis and the Soviets had signed
                    a friendship treaty, which we reported back to Washington. One of the few times
                    we had a scoop because the statement was in Russian, and nobody could understand
                    except me so I reported it out of Mogadishu before the press got it.</p>
                <p>Towards the end of my time in Somalia, that is to say in December of 1974, the
                    drought began to get real serious. The Somalis asked the Soviets and a variety
                    of other people for help. I knew they were going to ask for assistance. I was
                    sure they were going to ask us but they had not, so I told Washington I thought
                    they would. And sure enough they did then call me down, and asked me for
                    assistance, and using the ambassadorial authority that we have for emergencies,
                    I was able to commit $25,000, as it then was, right away. The disaster relief
                    people in the Department had a ship en route—one of many, I guess—to India with
                    some civil defense biscuits, biscuits that had been stored in civil defense
                    shelters in the United States.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: For 20 years.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KIRK: That's right, and they turned this ship around and it arrived at Mogadishu
                    harbor about 7 or 8 days after the Somalis had requested this assistance. This
                    was by far the most rapid assistance that anyone had produced. There was one
                    problem. I went out to the ship, was hoisted aboard in a breeches buoy because
                    there was no dock, as you know.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, I've made that trip.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KIRK: ...and was given one of these things to taste. It tasted perfectly awful. I
                    said, “My God, what are we doing?” Well, it turned out, either by accident or
                    deliberately, this particular biscuit had been lying in the scuppers for about a
                    week. But I got another one and it tasted fine, like a graham cracker would. The
                    speed with which we got things there was truly impressive, to me as well as to
                    the Somalis. I think this had a contribution to make— who knows how much—to
                    their eventual turning back to the United States because we were the one country
                    that delivered, and delivered fast.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, we had done that in a similarly small scale when I
                        was there, and I was even congratulated by the Soviet ambassador. He was
                        preparing other devices. Were you able to get around East Africa at all, or
                        were you pretty well confined?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>KIRK: Betty and I visited in Addis. The troubles were just starting and we were
                    told that we should not leave the embassy compound. We were there for 3 or 4
                    days but it hadn't gotten really bad. And we visited in Nairobi, and to our
                    great pleasure we were able to persuade our Charg� in both places to visit us in
                    Mogadishu. It seemed much harder to go from Nairobi or Addis to Mogadishu than
                    the reverse, but we did persuade them to come and we had some good exchanges on
                    policy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We did somewhat the same. We planned to travel quite a bit
                        but you must have needed to much more than we did, and probably were able to
                        get away less in some respects.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KIRK: We did go on one safari—oh, I guess you wouldn't call it that in
                    Somalia—with the CONOCO people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: CONOCO was still there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KIRK: CONOCO was there. We knew the police would give us heavy coverage so we
                    asked them to send a police guard with us, which they did. Each place we went we
                    accumulated another one until finally we were a party of 20 or 30, about 20 of
                    whom were Somali police of various forms and another.</p>
                <p>A couple of things there that struck me about the Somali experience. One, we
                    had—and he may have been there when you were there—a former Olympic athlete who
                    was helping African nations generally with their athletic programs, and a man
                    who was a basketball coach. I thought it was kind of a funny thing for the
                    American government to be funding. But this basketball coach was teaching the
                    sons of the elite of the ruling Council. He was a very outgoing kind of person
                    and he did more for the United States reputation in Somalia than anybody else,
                    as far as I'm concerned. He had much more contact, albeit of a limited nature,
                    with the people who were running the country than I did. I thought it was a very
                    good idea. He was a very intelligent, personable, black man, and he was really
                    just excellent. I thought that was a very useful program.</p>
                <p>The other thing is, at receptions occasionally—not at our house because Somalis
                    could not come—but in other places a Somali would come over to me very quietly
                    and say, “I spent three or four weeks in your country on a visitors program and
                    it was one of the most exciting and wonderful weeks of my life. I just wanted
                    you to know that,” and then would sidle away. I think that kind of program is
                    very useful in laying seeds that will bear fruit perhaps years or even decades
                    later.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The problem is to get them to go back.</hi>

                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>KIRK: Well, that's right.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have trouble getting out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KIRK: I had no trouble getting out in the sense that I got a telegram from I
                    guess the Under Secretary for Administration, saying, “The following is the text
                    of a memorandum which I have sent to the Secretary of State and which he has
                    approved.” One of the sentences in that memorandum was that Roger Kirk was
                    coming back to be the deputy in INR. So that gave me very little choice, I
                    felt.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's amazing that they wouldn't even explain it that
                        much.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KIRK: They wanted someone to handle particularly the administration of INR. It
                    was then being headed by one of the Secretary's close confidants, in fact
                    colleagues if you will, Bill Hyland, who had tremendous influence on policy
                    making with the Secretary, but who was not able to devote a great deal of time
                    to organization and running of the bureau. They wanted somebody to come back and
                    do that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was in...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KIRK: This was in February of '75. I'd been there about a year and three
                    months.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Still Kissinger, was it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KIRK: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I think that's plenty of time to be there with that
                        kind of atmosphere. I was there a little longer but I was top dog. So you
                        were really involved more in administration, than substantive.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>KIRK: Well, not really because Bill Hyland was really focused on what the
                    Secretary wanted him to do. Therefore essentially the running of the bureau,
                    with whatever direction he wished to give, was essentially up to me both in
                    terms of substance and in terms of administration.</p>
                <p>Bill Hyland was succeeded after about a year and a half by Harold Saunders,
                    another one of Kissinger's close associates. One of the things that we did
                    during that time, was to devise a formula for the Secretary's morning book. That
                    is the compendium of State Department telegrams and intelligence reports and
                    analyses that he receives each morning. The last two pages of that book in those
                    days...we devised a system of devoting them to two or three analytical pieces on
                    the affairs that we thought were of primary importance that he needed to know
                    about on a given day, with a brief paragraph of summary at the beginning and
                    then up to a page, or two- thirds of a page of analysis after that. We think he
                    read it usually. When Vance replaced Kissinger, he read it regularly on his way
                    from his house to the office. And I'm glad to see that that same format was
                    being used at least as of six months ago by INR. So it lasted a good ten
                    years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your man had to get it ready in time for the driver to
                        take it out to the house. You'd have to send an officer out with it I
                        suppose.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>KIRK: Well, that's right. On the analytical pieces, because we were just getting
                    started, I was the editor and sort of selector and chooser—I spent about half my
                    time actually as it later turned out on that book in the early months. The
                    analytical pieces we did the afternoon before, and then just had them checked to
                    be sure that nothing had happened in the interim. But the other great advantage
                    was that either the director, that is to say Hyland or Saunders, or myself, were
                    always in the Secretary's staff meeting, whether it was a big one or a small
                    one, or even his meeting with four or five people. So we knew exactly what he
                    was worrying about, and we knew just exactly how much he knew about a given area
                    or a given problem. Problems have a habit of cropping up in obscure places. I
                    remember, for example, there was one on the border between Zaire and Chad. I
                    wasn't sure initially that the Secretary's top officers knew where Chad was. You
                    started with a map of Africa, and then the next day you had a map of Zaire and
                    Chad, and the next day you had a map of the little area we were talking about.
                    So within 48 hours we would quickly become familiar with the details of the
                    geography. You had to know exactly where to hit them at any given particular
                    points, you didn't seem to be talking down to them, or using a lot of terms and
                    things that they simply didn't understand and didn't know. And that way you're
                    able, if your intelligence people are that sitting close, even if not saying
                    anything, to where the Secretary is making his policy, or working up his day, to
                    know exactly what can be most useful to him. That way you can really know what
                    he needs. He can never tell you what he needs, he doesn't have time to, and he
                    doesn't really know. I found that perhaps the most exciting part of the job. To
                    see what you put in the book one morning drive the staff meeting a half an hour
                    later was also quite rewarding. So I think that's really the key to having
                    intelligence be effective. To know exactly what the people who are going to use
                    it are worrying about, and how much they know about the subject.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is an interesting follow on to your being in the
                        Secretariat in your first job. You started out by...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KIRK: ...reading all that stuff.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were reading into them...</hi>

                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>KIRK: I highlighted material with a yellow pencil to give to the Secretary. INR,
                    of course, was also responsible for the external research budget of the
                    Department of State in those days. We had at that time about $14-$15 million a
                    year to spend. One thing I must say that struck me, was the extraordinary
                    difficulty of getting information and insights from the academic world into the
                    minds of policy makers For a variety of reasons. The academic world was on such
                    a different time schedule than the policy maker, or even the near policy maker.
                    You'd ask someone in the academic world for something and they'd say they'd have
                    an outline in six months, and what you really needed was the finished product in
                    six days. And also, it would be a 300 page book, and what you really needed was
                    a two or three page, or one page memorandum. So we struggled with how to get
                    information to the policy maker. We found that conferences and meetings were
                    often a very useful way of doing it. One of the best ways of doing it was to
                    plan to have a session with, let's say the office director or maybe even the
                    Assistant Secretary level, as to how the study would be set up, and sort of
                    where it would head. Often that's all that the people in the Department ever
                    knew about the study but from that alone they got a sense as to what the
                    academics were thinking, and what their ideas were. But bringing the two
                    together is very, very hard.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is that program continuing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KIRK: INR still has a substantial budget but ACDA has a good size budget of its
                    own for research, and some of the bureaus I think have small amounts they
                    themselves can contract out. INR's budget is much reduced for that reason, I
                    believe, and perhaps for the reasons I've suggested.</p>
                <p>The other thing, of course, that we were to do was to exert political control
                    over the CIA. That is another function of INR. This was the period of the
                    Senatorial and House investigations of the intelligence community. The Church
                    committee investigated the intelligence community at a certain length but only
                    focused on assassinations, allegations that the CIA had tried to assassinate. A
                    large part of our job in the front office was to maintain liaison on those
                    investigations with the White House. We used to meet in the situation room every
                    week to discuss how the investigations were going, what material to release to
                    the Senate and House, what material not to release, what material to exert
                    executive privilege on, and what material not. Something that was closely
                    monitored by the White House staff.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This must have been a very poisonous atmosphere.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KIRK: Terrible.</p>

                        there didn't we, on the committee staffs.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KIRK: Yes, and in my own view the committee investigation—the Church
                    investigation—was not a serious effort in that they quickly fastened on this
                    assassination business, and went after that which was only a very small part of
                    the whole picture. It quickly, rather than becoming a cooperative effort to
                    determine where in fact abuses had occurred and what controls needed to be put
                    on, became a battle trying to extract documents from the administration and
                    embarrass an administration that didn't give up the documents.</p>
                <p>

                        this with considerable interest.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KIRK: We were told at one time that they had a room in the House, I believe, set
                    aside to keep the Secretary in as they were going to lock him up for not
                    providing enough documents. I always felt my job was to keep him out of that
                    room.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It never quite came to that point.</hi>

                <p>KIRK: It never quite came to that point.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now we're about to break the long list of foreign hell
                        holes that you've been to, and go to Vienna.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KIRK: Actually that was kind of amusing because—you'd be interested in this. They
                    asked me would I go to Ethiopia, and I said if that's what they wanted me to do,
                    I would. And they then sent a message out to Addis, and the Charg� came back
                    with probably a very sensible recommendation. He said that the fact that I had
                    been ambassador in Somalia, even though I was a fine fellow and all that, would
                    really make it exceedingly difficult for me to be effective in Addis. So I was
                    called up and told that that was not going to happen, but that they'd like to
                    send me to Vienna. And Warren Christopher, who was on the telephone, said, “The
                    music is better in Vienna anyway.”</p>
                <p>So I then went home with the news that we weren't going to Africa, we were going
                    to Austria. This was in the job of what they called resident representative to
                    the International Atomic Energy Agency which was headquartered in Vienna, a UN
                    system organization there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, well I was somewhat familiar with that job because we
                        used to have meetings in Vienna and we'd always talk with whoever was there
                        in that job.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>KIRK: That was an interesting job because...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was your principal? The guy who was sort of the
                        official ambassador there? Or by that time were you it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KIRK: No. The U.S. representative on the Governing Board was Gerry Smith, Gerard
                    Smith, who was based in Washington. There were meetings of the Board four times
                    a year. Gerry came out for most of those. Then he got ill and for about a year
                    he didn't come, so I just stood in for him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think it has been that way for a long time but there was
                        a period when you were deputy chief of mission.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KIRK: Well, that's right. It was a little tricky in that sense, except, of
                    course, Gerry Smith was such a gentleman that he ended up having enough
                    confidence in me so that he came just for two or three days at a time. Actually
                    there was a mission to the International Atomic Energy and there was also a U.S.
                    mission to the United Nations Industrial Development Organization, another UN
                    organization in Vienna. When the person heading that mission, who was a
                    Counselor of Embassy in the U.S. embassy to Austria, left, I suggested that the
                    two be combined into a single mission to the UN organizations, which was done. I
                    was actually head of two separate missions co-located in the same building for a
                    while, then they combined them into a single mission. This made much more sense
                    because all of our foreign diplomatic colleagues were handling all the UN
                    organizations and you would often trade-off an understanding, shall we say, in
                    one organization on your part for an understanding in another organization on
                    their part. It was very important to be able to do that, to be able to speak for
                    the U.S. Government in all of these organizations. One thing certainly that
                    struck me was that when you have permanent representatives doing a lot of the
                    work, they develop a camaraderie, a mutual respect, and a mutual confidence that
                    facilitate regional agreements. It makes it a lot easier.</p>
                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>Of course, multilateral policy is something entirely different, in my view, than
                    bilateral diplomacy. It's much more like a legislator, at least multilateral
                    diplomacy in the sense of diplomacy in one of these big international
                    organizations. You have resolutions you want to pass, you've got to get the
                    votes for them, you have to trade concessions on something that someone else
                    wants, for something that you want. A lot of it is negotiation, almost all on
                    the spot. The Department simply can do nothing more than give you general
                    guidelines. I'm assuming we're not in a crucial world shattering negotiation in
                    which case it's much slower and every single step must be monitored. But in
                    these kinds of things your real decision, and your real negotiation, is done in
                    the last three or four hours in any conference no matter how long that
                    conference is—be it one week, two weeks or six weeks. There's no way you can get
                    instructions as that process goes on.</p>
                <p>One of the interesting things about Vienna was that in the Atomic Energy Agency,
                    for example, we and the Soviets were usually on the same side of any given
                    question. We both had nuclear weapons, and we did not want other people to have
                    them. We both wanted to keep the budget of the organization down. We both wanted
                    the organization to be what we would call responsible, that is responsive to the
                    things that we thought best. So we consulted regularly and amicably, even during
                    bad periods in American-Soviet relations, and essentially were pushing the same
                    points of view. Their negotiating techniques and ours, of course, were quite
                    different. I would drive my Soviet colleague bananas by trying to find out what
                    the other people wanted, and offering limited concessions fairly early in the
                    process. He said, “You're giving things away too soon.” I'd say, “Oleg, in the
                    last two hours you'll give everything away. We don't want to do that. You'll
                    just cave.” But between the two of us we managed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have to use your Russian a good deal at that time
                        too?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KIRK: Yes, a certain amount of the time I would. That kind of conversation I
                    would have privately with him in Russian. Two Soviets were there during the five
                    and a half years that I was there; one interestingly enough had been Molotov's
                    private aide for ten or twelve years while Molotov was Prime Minister. He had
                    seen, I'm sure, a great deal of the inner workings of the Soviet Union under
                    Stalin. I asked him what time they knocked off work, and he said, “About 2:00 in
                    the morning.” And I said, “What time did he go back to work?” and he said,
                    “About 10:00.” He was followed by another very even more capable Soviet who had
                    been deputy head of their treaty section, and a very skilled negotiator.</p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>What else to say about the multilateral business? Certainly the importance of
                    making up the U.S. position very early so that you can persuade other people,
                    have other people take it into account, or persuade them of it, before they form
                    their own positions, and particularly before they form group positions.
                    Increasingly most of the countries of the world get together in regional, or
                    larger than regional groupings in these UN organizations, and hammer out a
                    common position, which then becomes very difficult to change, because it means
                    going back to five, ten, fifteen or fifty countries and trying to get them to
                    change. For practical reasons alone, it is very important to get in there early
                    to identify the two or three individuals who are key, persuade them of the
                    rightness of your point of view, work out some sort of compromise with them, and
                    then have that become their group's position. You're much more successful that
                    way. It's often, of course, difficult to get Washington to make up its mind in
                    time because they don't understand.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's foolish negotiating and being reviewed by the
                        government in some cases. Well, now I'm very interested in the question of
                        focusing on things like nuclear or non-proliferation, and all the other
                        things that you were working on all this time. Is the IAEA, at least in the
                        nuclear field, is that the instrument? Is that a fitting instrument that
                        will be effective to administer controls, do you think?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KIRK: I think the IAEA has a limited function that it performs very well. That
                    limited function is to assure that peaceful nuclear facilities and material
                    declared to them are not used for military purposes. Now what does that mean?
                    That means that the IAEA does not have the right to go around looking for
                    material. It only has the right to say, “What you have told us you have is not
                    being used for military purposes.” That you get by inspecting and checking and
                    all the rest. And that's very valuable. Most countries in the world, under the
                    non-proliferation treaty, have the obligation to report to the IAEA all of their
                    nuclear facilities, and all their nuclear material. But again, the IAEA does not
                    have the right to see, to go to some plant...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That it hasn't been officially notified.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KIRK: That it hasn't been officially notified about. So within those rather
                    precise limits the IAEA has been quite effective. All the IAEA can do is to say,
                    in the event this is the case, that it cannot give assurances that the material
                    is being used only for civilian purposes. Then it's up to the member states to
                    decide what they're going to do about that. In other words, it simply sends up a
                    warning flag.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And there's no enforcement mechanism per se in IAEA.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>KIRK: The only thing the IAEA can do is make a statement like that and report it
                    to the UN Security Council.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It looks as though we're going to have many more of these
                        jobs in the future, chemical warfare, and so on. What other mechanism is
                        available? What would you recommend?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KIRK: For example, in the case of Iraq the Security Council passed a resolution
                    saying that Iraq must open its entire country to international inspection for,
                    let's say, nuclear material. Iraq, under duress, agreed to this. And the IAEA
                    will in fact be the agency that will do this. But under duress is important
                    because if you don't have duress an international agency depends upon the
                    voluntary cooperation of its member states, and indeed of each member state. So
                    that you can't compel a member state to do something it doesn't want to do. An
                    international organization cannot do that. The member states by using various
                    kinds of economic pressure, or military pressure, could do that. But the
                    international organization is essentially an inert mechanism. It is pushed one
                    way or the other by its member states.</p>

                </p>
                <p>KIRK: Now, of course, in most cases something like inspections, let's say of
                    nuclear weapons, or chemical weapons, is something that is desired, or at least
                    accepted willingly by the member state because it wants to assure its neighbors
                    that it in fact does not have a program. In other words, inspection is most
                    effective for countries that are not violating, because they can show that they
                    are not violating. By opening themselves, they put pressure on their neighbors,
                    or people they're worried about, to open themselves. Essentially it's built on
                    mutual cooperation, rather than on mutual compulsion.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How would you encapsulate the prospects of effective
                        international control of these things over the long term.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>KIRK: I think it depends. I think nuclear weapons probably are pretty clearly not
                    very useful to any given country. We thought about it, of course, recently in
                    connection with India and Pakistan, because there was some thought that they
                    might go to war last fall, and would they use nuclear weapons? Well, it's not
                    clear that it would have been to either one's advantage to do so, unless, for
                    example, the Indians were really bearing down on Rawalpindi and Karachi, and
                    Pakistan was about to be wiped off the face of the map. Then a desperation move
                    to use nuclear weapons might have some sense in kind of an odd way. But for
                    Iraq, for example, to have used nuclear weapons doesn't make a whole lot of
                    sense. Nuclear weapons seem to carry their own deterrence, not only for great
                    powers but for small powers. To the extent that is true, there are good
                    prospects for reasonably effective inspection of nuclear weapons. Chemical
                    weapons, I think, is much more difficult. In short what I'm saying is that
                    international inspection probably is only useful when the country being
                    inspected has an interest in it. It has an interest either because it wants to
                    prove that its not doing anything, because it wants to deter its neighbors, or
                    because the weapons are not useful to it. To the extent that those conditions
                    can be created, international inspection can give the proper international
                    confidence and the proper mechanism, for carrying out inspections that otherwise
                    would be very difficult to carry out.</p>
                <p>For example, the Mexicans made it quite clear at one point that they would not be
                    prepared to accept U.S. inspectors in their country. They'd be very happy, or at
                    least prepared, to receive IAEA inspectors in their country. If they happened to
                    be American citizens, that wouldn't bother them.</p>

                <p>KIRK: Don't have the U.S. flag. And I think that would be true of many of these
                    other situations as well, though in some cases, the countries involved will want
                    to have bilateral inspection as well as international inspection. The Israelis,
                    for example, you can be certain would want to have Israeli inspectors in the
                    Arab states; and the Arabs would probably want to have Arab inspectors in Israel
                    in addition to whatever international organization it was. That would be of
                    benefit from the point of view of...</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>KIRK: UNIDO is really a much less effective organization. It was of interest
                    because it was in the process of transforming itself into what they call a
                    specialized agency of UN, and questions of constitution, of balance of the
                    governing bodies, how you determine the budget, were all subject for intense
                    discussion and consultation. It took a lot of time and there was a lot of
                    interesting negotiation going on. But in terms of its contribution to the world
                    as a whole, it was much less effective and less important to the United
                    States.</p>
                <p>We also had what I call Drugs, Women and Crime. The narcotics branches of the UN
                    are all located in Vienna as are the Crime Prevention Branch, as is the
                    Commission for Social Development and Humanitarian Affairs. It took care of
                    women's rights... As indeed was UNRA, the UN body in those days managing the
                    Palestine refugee camps in Lebanon.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'd forgotten that was in Vienna. So you really got a

                </p>
                <p>KIRK: A lot of different things, plus we'd occasionally have the World Assembly
                    of the Aging there, or the World Year of the Disabled. It was a very varied and
                    interesting time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, eventually all good things come to an end, and you
                        had to come back to Washington. What was the story about the transition? The
                        reason I always ask is that you find some very interesting stories sometimes
                        on assignments, and why you got it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KIRK: I mentioned that I was heading two separate missions, and they were then
                    combined into a single mission. I was asked by the Department to stay on to see
                    that through, even though I'd already been there five and a half years, and I
                    said I would be prepared to do that. But then I received word from a friend that
                    the gossip column of the Washington Post had said that a certain individual in
                    the White House staff was packing his bags for Vienna, and specifically for my
                    job. So I made an inquiry saying I knew I'd been there a long time, it was
                    perfectly logical that I would go, so what was the story? And the story, which
                    was told by my successor to many people in a perfectly open way, so I feel
                    perfectly free to repeat it, was that he, Richard Williamson, was in the White
                    House working on federal-state relations. He decided to stop doing that, and to
                    go out into private industry. When he announced that intention, his bosses, and
                    indeed the President, expressed their regrets and said they felt he had done a
                    very good job. He said he really wanted to do this. And as he was leaving the
                    President's office, along with his boss, the President said, “Have you ever
                    thought of going abroad?” He said, “No.” And the President said, “Why don't you
                    think it over? Come back tomorrow.” So they showed him the list of the posts
                    that were at that moment up before the White House. Vienna was one of them, and
                    he came back and said, “I think maybe Vienna would be nice.” So he was assigned
                    to Vienna. As I say, he tells the story himself.</p>
                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>Coming out of Vienna I was originally supposed to go as the State Department
                    representative on the delegation to SALT it was then called, headed by Rowney,
                    replacing Jim Goodby. For a variety of reasons I decided not to do that, and I
                    came back to Washington. On my way back, as a matter of fact, from Vienna to
                    Washington, I was in Rome and staying in a pensione, a little one, and got a
                    call there from Washington, saying would I take the job as deputy in the Bureau
                    of International Organization Affairs, which I said I would.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you got fully both feet into international
                        organizations.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KIRK: Yes, yes. In that job in Washington I was the senior deputy and also the
                    one really responsible for the UN in New York. Jeane Kirkpatrick was in New York
                    so we didn't really have a great deal to do about New York.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Would she talk with you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KIRK: She dealt essentially with the Secretary, or with the President usually—not
                    with assistant secretaries, much less deputy assistant secretaries. She was
                    perfectly pleasant enough about it, but she really pretty much did her own thing
                    up there. But, of course, there were lots of things that she didn't want to give
                    personal attention to. We would provide backup for activities in the delegation
                    and position papers on a variety of things which would be in the General
                    Assembly. That's a difficult bureau to manage, and to operate, because you're
                    essentially getting into other people's business most of the time, the UN
                    aspects of Africa, or the UN aspects of the Middle East, or the UN aspects of
                    the Far East. You've got to have good officers who know how to assert themselves
                    without giving offense. It was an interesting exercise. I must say the United
                    Nations General Assembly is a very frustrating place. It has to exist. People
                    need a place where they can sound off and where the views of all different kinds
                    of people can be heard. It's not a place to get a great deal of negotiating
                    done. We used to say that if you wanted to have a serious negotiation, you took
                    it out of the UNGA, and if someone was taking you into the UNGA, you knew they
                    were not serious about it. Now, the UNGA could often sanctify, or put its stamp
                    of approval on a negotiation such as the Namibia settlement. The Security
                    Council could move you forward by sanctifying, or approving something that has
                    already been worked out. The Assembly could give a very important and in many
                    cases indispensable, international cover to a settlement. But in terms of
                    actually reaching a settlement, that is not the forum in which to do it, albeit,
                    the halls of the UN might be where its done.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I take it by the time you were there that there wasn't
                        quite as much pressure, because it was totally impossible anyway to win
                        every damn vote that ever came down the pike.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                <p>KIRK: Well, to the contrary. I would say Jeane Kirkpatrick, Ambassador
                    Kirkpatrick, one of her, I think, real contributions was to say, “What is done
                    in the UN matters, what is said in the UN matters, we're going to take it
                    seriously. So we're not going to sit by and let a lot of nonsense go by. We're
                    going to fight it.” And I think on balance that was sound. We will not dignify
                    it with a reply, is the kind of line they used to use. She said, “Everything
                    should be dignified with a reply in the sense that if someone says the U.S. is
                    to blame for this or that problem in the world, and we're not, we'll say so.” So
                    that in many cases we fought harder for votes, and were more critical of people
                    for not voting the right way, than we were under previous regimes. I often felt
                    that one of the most difficult things for a small country was to be on the
                    Security Council because they came under tremendous pressure.</p>

                </p>
                <p>KIRK: From ourselves, from the Soviets and others. Even in the UNGA we focus on
                    Israel. We fought very hard for votes on that. But if you're on the Security
                    Council you're really under the gun because each vote counts, and we wanted to
                    avoid the veto if we could. We used it quite often but avoided it if we could do
                    so by lining up a country not to go with the majority, or to abstain, or to go
                    with us. A lot of pressure was put on countries to do that, and it was very
                    uncomfortable for some of them.</p>

                <p>KIRK: No, there's a little story behind that, I suppose. The Bureau of Personnel,
                    and the Under Secretary for Administration, were the people whom you had to look
                    to to take care of the people who were not in regional bureaus for Chief of
                    Mission posts, or DCM posts. In other words, if you weren't on the team of one
                    bureau or the other the only one that's going to recommend you for an ambassador
                    was the system, if you will. I got a call saying that I was the Department's
                    nominee for Portugal, which was quite exciting, but they cryptically added, not
                    to get worried about it. It was going to go to a White House person, they knew
                    who it was. So I was what was termed the burnt offering on Portugal. But then
                    the other thing that apparently happened is once a Foreign Service officer was
                    turned down by the White House, for a White House appointee, the next post that
                    he or she was put up for would—within reason, if it wasn't too obviously a
                    political one—would be given to him or her rather than have it go to another
                    political appointee. So after the burnt offering came a phone call. You're not
                    given a whole lot of time to decide on these things, as you know Tully. On the
                    phone they said, “You have been turned down for Portugal, but we're nominating
                    you for Romania.” “Okay,” said I.</p>

                    what we were trying to do with Romania was to encourage their somewhat
                    independent stance with the Soviets. That is to say, Ceausescu took as
                    independent a position as he really could given his geographic location, and his
                    relatively weak power compared to that of the Soviets. He did not allow Warsaw
                    Pact ground forces maneuver on his soil. He had no Russian troops on his soil.
                    He differed from the Soviets on a number of UN issues. He maintained diplomatic
                    relations with Israel throughout the time that the Soviets broke them off. He
                    was relatively nice to the small Jewish community in Romania, some 25,000 as
                    compared to the way he treated the rest of the population, and as compared to
                    the way Jews were treated in most of Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union at that
                    time. On the other hand, his internal policies were very distasteful to us. The
                    big issue between the United States and Romania, and within the U.S. Government,
                    was whether to continue to extend Most Favored Nation tariff treatment to
                    Romania. It was renewed on an annual basis. The essential argument for it was
                    the relative independence of foreign policy and the belief—I think sound
                    belief—that extending MFN enabled us to help a few human rights cases and was
                    the thing which persuaded, or compelled, Ceausescu to let about 2,000 to 2,500
                    Romanians emigrate to the United States each year. Those opposing extension of
                    MFN argued that it was a sign of our approval for the regime, or at least it was
                    portrayed by the regime as such, and we had no business giving that kind of
                    approval to a regime of that kind. Both sides of the argument, it seemed to me,
                    have a sound, perfectly justifiable, basis. I, for a number of years, came out
                    on the side of continuing to extend MFN. I remember talking to Roz Ridgway about
                    it. She was the one who had to testify as Secretary for European Affairs. She
                    said that from her point of view, it was worthwhile to get the 2,000 or 2,500
                    people out of Romania each year. If it were cut off those people would no longer
                    be able to leave.</p>

                </p>
                <p>KIRK: Not so many in Romania. The principal argument on the Hill was one not made
                    by the administration as such, although we did make it. It was the concern of
                    those interested in the welfare of the Jewish community, that turning off MFN
                    would lead to a marked deterioration of the condition of that community.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were they, the Romanians, still selling visas to the Jews

                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>KIRK: The Romanians enjoyed a certain amount of economic benefits, loans and this
                    kind of thing, from Israel. A number of tourists came from Israel, and, of
                    course, they got MFN. I think all these were very much in their mind. I'm not
                    myself sure that there was actually a cash payment per head, the way there was
                    with Germans going out to Germany. Between 12,000 and 14,000 ethnic Germans went
                    out to Germany each year from Romania, and it was a very definite commercial, in
                    effect, payment.</p>

                <p>KIRK: Some people said that. I'm really in no position to say whether it was
                    right or not. Certainly they let the Jews out of Romania because they thought it
                    was in their, the Romanians, interest for a variety of reasons. It was not for
                    humanitarian reasons. Ceausescu had power to do what he wanted.</p>

                </p>
                <p>KIRK: Yes. Most of those Iron Curtain posts, what were then Iron Curtain posts,
                    had the common three year tour by that time. Three years would have had me
                    leaving in November of '88, which of course makes no sense because that's
                    exactly the time of a Presidential election. It would have been quite difficult
                    to appoint an ambassador to replace me, or anyone else, in the last months of an
                    administration, and not so easy to do it in the first month or two of an
                    administration. I, and a number of other people in that same category were kept
                    on for six months or so extra. U.S. ambassadors live reasonably well everywhere.
                    Certainly, though the health facilities were not very good, they were better

                    a number of towns. United States was looked on with great favor by the Romania
                    people. We sort of symbolized for them democracy, freedom and prosperity, and

                <pb facs="0060" n="Page0060"/>
                <p>KIRK: Yes, exactly. They would sort of express enthusiasm for us as a country,
                    and as individuals, wherever we went. Our contacts with Ceausescu were quite
                    limited. They really were mainly on quite formal occasions, usually when a
                    visitor would come to Romania. In the first couple of years, that is in '86 and
                    part of '87, almost every month or two—let's say every two months—a fairly
                    prominent American Jewish leader would come to talk with Ceausescu, again urging
                    him to continue to treat the Jewish population of the country in a decent way,
                    and not to destroy some Jewish buildings. And I would often, not always, but
                    often be asked by them to accompany them to meet the President so I sat in on a
                    number of these conversations. Ceausescu had a habit, which he claimed was a
                    traditional Romanian habit—and I have no reason not to believe that- -of
                    allowing the guests to speak first after he would say, “I'm so glad you've
                    come.” Then he would say, “As our guests, I'd liked to hear what you have to
                    say.” And I always, after the first time or two, advised the visitors to say
                    everything that they wanted to say at that moment because they might not get
                    another chance. And, if they took my advice, they would sometimes speak for 15
                    or 20 minutes. Ceausescu would then respond to each of the points that they had
                    made. He had a very good memory in that sense. He wouldn't take any note, but he
                    would meet each point that they had made—in his own way, of course, giving his
                    own point of view. He was quite good in that kind of situation. His ideas were
                    at considerable variance from ours of course, but he was certainly very sharp.
                    He was not well educated, but he was intelligent without question, and civil.
                    These conversations often lasted for two or three hours. I would be the note
                    taker because there were just the two of us in the room. I must say taking notes
                    for two or three hours and then having to reproduce it was a great trial.
                    Something ambassadors aren't supposed to have to do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What language did Ceausescu speak?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KIRK: Ceausescu would speak in Romanian, and it would then be interpreted.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, I see, so there was an interpreter.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KIRK: I could understand the Romanian but the practice with Ceausescu was always
                    to speak in one's own language, except the occasional word of greeting.
                    Sometimes Ceausescu would say something in Romanian, or I would. I never heard
                    him use a foreign word.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How much Romanian did you manage to learn by that time
                        when you were there?</hi>

                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>KIRK: Before I went out I told the people in the Department that I thought it
                    would be a good idea if I had some time to learn Romanian, and could take a
                    class or have a private tutor. They said it would be fine for me to have a
                    private tutor at FSI and just please do my regular job at the same time. So I
                    took a couple hours off about three days a week. Romanian is a language that is
                    quite similar to Italian or French.</p>

                <p>KIRK: With a certain amount of Russian words so speaking all three it was
                    relatively easy for me. I was pretty fluent by the time I got there.</p>

                <p>KIRK: That's a much tougher language.</p>

                </p>
                <p>KIRK: I took lessons while I was there, and then I really did most of my business
                    in Romanian. In the Foreign Ministry I would have them speak in Romanian, and I
                    would speak in English. I think if each person speaks in their native language
                    you have a much better exchange than having that person speaking in your
                    language, or trying to use an interpreter.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's very true, indeed.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KIRK: So, what was the job in Romania? It was essentially to try and maintain
                    contact with all levels of society, while not appearing to embrace the
                    government, something that is difficult to do if the government controls access
                    to all elements of society. We had an American library that was quite well
                    attended. We had a variety of USIA programs which were squeezed out as time went
                    on, but some continued up until the very end. I myself did a lot of traveling
                    around, saw a lot of people, visited factories and theaters and all the kinds of
                    organizations to try to remind people that the United States was still there. I
                    would do statements or readings for the VOA that would then be broadcast into
                    Romania. I was not allowed to broadcast on the local TV, but more people
                    listened to VOA than listened to the local Romanian broadcast anyway. That was
                    essentially what we were trying to do, plus of course keeping up the staff
                    morale, and keeping reports going back to Washington, and following the human
                    rights developments and abuses in Romania. Keeping contact with dissidents,
                    keeping the staff active in doing that but not so active that they got
                    themselves thrown out. In that way it was quite interesting.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I always figured that one job for an ambassador in those
                        small curtain countries was to take care of some of the western diplomatic
                        corps. There were always a few Latinos around who were maybe by themselves,
                        or one thing and another, and if you could pay a little extra attention to
                        them that maybe would be worthwhile. I don't know. An ambassador is a pretty
                        expensive appointment for that, just to do that but I still felt this was
                        carrying out our mission in a sense. I don't know what experience you had
                        with that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KIRK: I think that's right. Bucharest had a large diplomatic corps. The Romanians
                    were very active in their relations with the Third World, and in some cases even
                    paid the expenses of Africa countries. So there were about 60 or 70 missions in
                    Bucharest. Getting around to all of them was not exactly easy but there were the
                    receptions and things that one went to. We had good relations with most of those
                    people. We had about four people in the political section and two or three in
                    the economic section, and they managed to get around.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's a pretty good sized staff. Of course, Romania has
                        twice the population of Bulgaria.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KIRK: In all we had about sixty or seventy Americans.</p>

                </p>
                <p>KIRK: That includes the Marine Guards. Still that was about the size. So we had a
                    good sized operation going, and we had the school which, of course, is very
                    important to our fellow diplomats.</p>

                <p>KIRK: As you know in those situations, security concerns are an important
                    element—security in the sense of technical security, not your own personal
                    security which was no problem.</p>

                <p>KIRK: Here we found that talking with academics, having visitors coming in under
                    the USIA program, just keeping on working was essentially an act of faith on our
                    part that eventually something would pay off. Though I was not there during the
                    revolution, I visited again a few months after it, and was pleased to see that a
                    number of the people that we had maintained contact with, either myself or
                    members of the embassy staff, had turned up in important positions, and were
                    grateful for the attention that we had shown them, and for our continuing
                    concern for them. It has now to some extent paid off, even though the regime is
                    still a difficult one from our point of view. There are a number of people in it
                    who benefitted from our attentions.</p>

                <p>KIRK: Yes, the people who are running it now are people who were communists, who
                    were prominent communist leaders under Ceausescu and fell out of favor with him
                    for a variety of reasons. They now realize the need for economic reform. They
                    grudgingly permit the existence of an opposition even though they don't like it
                    much and tend to strike out against it if the going gets at all difficult.</p>

                    very interesting and useful thing to do as well as being an enjoyable one. I
                    wanted to do it in Washington, and I wanted to do it at Georgetown, so I told
                    David and he said that would be very acceptable to him. And I then told the
                    people in the Department that I would like to do that, and they were only too
                    happy to oblige. So that was all set up pretty much before I came back.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was more or less the conventional year, but you got
                        into some real teaching, didn't you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KIRK: That's right. I was told I could do pretty much what I wanted, and I said
                    the one reason I wanted to be at a university was I wanted to see how I liked
                    teaching the students. So the second half of the year I taught a course on the
                    history of international relations since World War II, which was helpful in
                    preparing for this tape. I had some satisfaction in telling the students that
                    was the story of my life, and filling them full of war stories, and I hope some
                    insights. I found that very rewarding.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were these undergraduates?</hi>

                <p>KIRK: Graduate students, in the School of Foreign Service. I think that is a very
                    interesting thing to do. When you bring to the academic world someone who has
                    been a practitioner, as they call it, you bring an insight and dimension to the
                    students that otherwise they do not normally get. And by dint of teaching, you,
                    as everyone of course says, do dig into it yourself, you refresh your memory at
                    least, and maybe more than that. You get to know a lot more about the subject
                    than you did before. So I found that a very worthwhile thing to do. And as my
                    wife and I didn't particularly want to go abroad again, we decided at the end of
                    that year just to stay here in Washington, so I retired from the Foreign Service
                    in August of '90.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But you're still at Georgetown now, are you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KIRK: And then Georgetown asked me to stay on as an adjunct professor.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Have you got a final blessing for the Foreign Service, or
                        a statement on your career?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KIRK: I certainly enjoyed my Foreign Service career.</p>
