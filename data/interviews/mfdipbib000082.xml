                <p>AMBASSADOR MAURICE BERNBAUM</p>
                <p>Interviewed by: Charles Stuart Kennedy </p>
                <p>Initial interview date: January 13, 1988</p>
                <p>Copyright 1998 ADST</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Mr. Ambassador, what brought you into the Foreign
                        Service?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERNBAUM: When I was a senior at Harvard I became friendly with an English
                    graduate student from Cambridge. I was interested then in going into investment
                    banking. He came from a Foreign Office family. His father, grandfather, brother,
                    were all in the British Foreign Service. So we used to have great debates about
                    which would be more interesting.</p>
                <p>After I was graduated . . .</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You graduated what year?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERNBAUM: In '31.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Class of '31.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERNBAUM: The economy just fell apart.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's not a good time to be an investment banker.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERNBAUM: No. Investment banking virtually disappeared, and at that point I
                    recalled my conversations with this English friend. And so I applied to take the
                    Foreign Service exams. My first application was made a bit late, so it wasn't
                    accepted. That was in 1932. And I applied again in 1936. I took a cram course
                    for about one month, and then took the exams and passed them. And I was
                    appointed as Vice Consul at Vancouver at the end of '36, and I arrived there
                    just before New Years.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this a system where you took the exam and then you
                        were told to go from your home straight to Vancouver? Or did you come for
                        training here in Washington before you went to Vancouver?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERNBAUM: I went to Vancouver first, and then came to Washington for training at
                    the Foreign Service School. That lasted about three months. But Vancouver was
                    more or less a training and probationary post for me, and I was put through the
                    various paces.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find that system worked?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERNBAUM: I thought it was very good. I thought it gave us a pretty good idea
                    first of what being in the Foreign Service was like. I was a Vice Consul at
                    Vancouver, and I learned about just what the functions were, and so I was in a
                    better position when I arrived at the Foreign Service School to appreciate the
                    training that we got there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Some practical knowledge beforehand, I think, does make a
                        great deal of sense.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERNBAUM: Yes, it made a great deal of difference.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find the entrance examination rather
                        rigorous?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERNBAUM: It was quite rigorous. It lasted for three days, about six hours each
                    day. I believe there were about 2500 or 3000 applicants, of whom about 120 or so
                    passed the written exam. And then we took an oral exam later. And about 22 of us
                    survived.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any thoughts of what you wanted to do in the
                        Foreign Service, both before you took the exam and after you finished in
                        Vancouver?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERNBAUM: No, nothing specific. I had a good economic background, and so I hoped
                    that I'd be able to capitalize on that. But I was interested in just the Foreign
                    Service, the romantic aspect of it, I think, attracted me too. The idea of going
                    to far away places. And, as a matter of fact, my choice after going to Foreign
                    Service School had been Singapore. That always seemed to be a rather romantic
                    place. And it was an interesting place.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you go, I mean sort of tasted the romance of the
                        Far East. How did you find yourself moving into the Latin American
                        circuit?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>BERNBAUM: Well, that was interesting. I got married and I had been slated to go
                    to Algiers, and then war was then on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes. This was when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERNBAUM: This was—I returned from Singapore just before Pearl Harbor. And we
                    were in the war shortly afterwards. I was slated to go to Algiers, but because I
                    got married, apparently there were second thoughts in Personnel, and they sent
                    me to Caracas, Venezuela instead.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As I recall, we had a large number of Vice Consuls in
                        Algiers who were basically the equivalent of CIA people at that time,
                        reporting on the situation prior to our landing because of Vichy,
                        France.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERNBAUM: That would have been the FBI then.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, it was more by happenstance that you were assigned to
                        Latin America—had you had any Spanish?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERNBAUM: No. I spoke pretty good French, pretty good German, and as a matter of
                    fact, when I left Vancouver I made a bet with one of the non-career vice consuls
                    that I would not go to Latin America. I won the bet, and then I had to pay him
                    back after I went to Caracas.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, in Caracas, what would a foreign service officer be
                        doing in a post like that during the war? You must have had duties other
                        than just the normal peace time duties.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERNBAUM: Yes. I started there as a vice consul. The Consulate and the embassy
                    were separate. And then because of my interest in economics, and my background
                    in economics, I was assigned to the embassy as third secretary, where I did
                    primarily economic work. And part of that was the blacklist.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was prohibiting exports to the Axis countries, is
                        that right?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERNBAUM: That's right. We collaborated with the Venezuelan government in
                    preventing that, and also putting restrictions on the activities of Germans in
                    Venezuela, German firms in Venezuela.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did Venezuela enter the Allied cause during the war?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERNBAUM: No, no. It supported us. It was with us, but it was not a participant
                    in the war.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you had a series of other appointments. I note here,
                        including one as a DCM in Ecuador. You had a chance to sort of taste both of
                        the places where you later served.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERNBAUM: Yes, that's right. Again, that was happenstance. I went to Managua,
                    Nicaragua, although I had wanted to go to the war zone. I was particularly
                    interested, I think at the time, in Istanbul. But there was a great need for a
                    victim in Managua, Nicaragua, and I was it. As it turned it that was one of my
                    more interesting assignments.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What type of things were you doing in Managua?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERNBAUM: Well, I started there as Administrative Officer in charge of the
                    Consulate. And then I became Political Officer, because the Political Officer
                    had left. And eventually I became DCM there, in the absence of a formal DCM.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You must have been a relatively junior officer, I'm sure,
                        at that time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERNBAUM: Yes, I was. And that's where I learned Spanish, really. Because I found
                    myself dealing with political figures. The embassy was a center of political
                    activity. All the politicos would visit the embassy to speak with the
                    ambassador. I was in the adjoining office, and I would speak with these people
                    while they were waiting to see the ambassador. And so this, of course, sharpened
                    my Spanish, and I probably learned more Spanish during that period than at any
                    other time.</p>
                <p>And when the ambassador was assigned to another post, I became Charg� d'affaires.
                    I remained the Charg� d'affaires for about 13 months, and this was during a very
                    interesting period when Somoza staged a coup against . . .</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Somoza the father.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERNBAUM: The father, yes; he staged a coup against his wife's uncle, whom he had
                    helped elect. The old man, his wife's uncle, had proceeded to put pressure on
                    Somoza to leave the country, and that produced a coup against him. And I was in
                    charge at that time.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, did you find were we involved in giving support to
                        changes in the government there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERNBAUM: Well, that issue came up as the result of the Braden experience in
                    Argentina. The question arose as to whether we should use non-recognition.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Braden experience concerned Peron, didn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERNBAUM: That's right. And the problem arose as to whether we should continue
                    the policy of using nonrecognition as a device for influencing governments to
                    have democratic systems.</p>
                <p>I was there for 13 months, and during that whole period, while maintaining an
                    open posture of nonintervention, my efforts were always devoted to trying to
                    convince Somoza, whom I used to see quietly, we had no formal relations, to get
                    out. He was just a bit too smart for us.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, were you getting any particular instructions from
                        Washington? Did you feel that you were more acting on you own, or were you
                        under rather firm guidance from Washington at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERNBAUM: More on my own, I think.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Little interest.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERNBAUM: In other words, to the extent that I took the initiative, people in
                    Washington were quite content to let me do it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, something that will come up later on, and so I'm
                        sure that your Nicaraguan experience must have had an effect on how you
                        looked on the world, how did you find the influence of American business
                        interests in Nicaragua? Did you come away with any particular feeling
                        towards them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERNBAUM: By and large the business interests tended to collaborate with Somoza.
                    It was more convenient to work with a man with whom you could speak, get a final
                    decision, and know that decision was going to be upheld. And so by and large I
                    had the feeling that the business people, and there weren't very many in
                    Nicaragua, but those who were there tended to support Somoza.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: More for the very practical matter of getting on with the
                        work at hand?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERNBAUM: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you know at the time there, or was there sort of
                        under-lying resentment from the long period of US Marine rule, in
                        Nicaragua?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERNBAUM: That's very interesting. I rather expected to find that, but I didn't.
                    I suppose there was a great deal of resentment, probably in the more left wing
                    circles, especially in the Communist party. And during my early days in Managua,
                    I tried to make contact with the Communist party people to find out what they
                    were thinking about, but they wouldn't have anything to do with me. But by and
                    large I did not find any anti-American feeling because of the intervention. Not
                    at that time anyway.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you look upon the career? I notice your next
                        posting was—you went from Nicaragua as DCM to Ecuador. Did you feel you had
                        to lobby or push to get a job?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERNBAUM: I never did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel that there was a—if you did your job you were
                        given further responsibility, that there was a clear career pattern
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERNBAUM: Yes. Very definitely.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because one has the impression that today this is
                        beginning to break down.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERNBAUM: That started some time ago.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. But, then we'll come back to when you were in Ecuador
                        as ambassador. You were DCM in Ecuador, and then DCM in Venezuela. Were you
                        picking up things as a DCM saying, “I will never, never do such and such as
                        an ambassador,” at that time? Did you feel that you were training yourself
                        to be an ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERNBAUM: Well, yes in a sense. At each post I found myself the Charg� d'affaires
                    for quite a long time, and so I more or less had both functions. And the feeling
                    I had was it was much more difficult to be a Charg� d'affaires than it was to be
                    an ambassador.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERNBAUM: Because you knew that the ambassador, had very definite ideas about
                    what he wanted to do, and you would find situations arising that were not
                    necessarily consistent with his ideas. And so the question was, would I do what
                    I thought the ambassador would want me to do, or would I do what I thought was
                    the thing to do, which is not a problem an ambassador has.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After some time in the State Department you were in
                        Argentina as DCM in 1959 to 1960. What was the situation in Argentina at
                        that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERNBAUM: Well, Peron had just been overthrown. Actually he had been overthrown
                    when I got into the State Department from Venezuela, and I was in charge of the
                    Office of South American affairs. And I got to know the Argentines quite well.
                    We devoted ourselves after Peron's overthrow to reestablishing good relations
                    with the Argentines. I played a rather key role in that. And so I got to know
                    many Argentines.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you say you played a rather key role, how?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERNBAUM: Negotiations with the Argentines. We had economic negotiations with
                    them to settle outstanding economic problems, and through that I got to know
                    quite a few of the Argentine people, who I knew later when I went there.</p>
                <p>I was assigned to Buenos Aires because the previous DCM, who hadn't been there
                    very long, didn't seem to get along with the ambassador.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERNBAUM: Willard Beaulac.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was a career officer.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERNBAUM: A very highly respected career officer, with a great deal of experience
                    and with a lot of prestige in the foreign service, but a man who had very
                    definite ideas about how he wanted to run things. Apparently my predecessor and
                    he didn't get along very well. So very much to my surprise I was asked whether I
                    wanted to be DCM in Buenos Aires.</p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>Well, I'd already been in the department for about three years, it was time for
                    me to go, and so I said, “Fine.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, with Beaulac, what was our policy and what was
                        Beaulac's attitude towards dealing with Argentina at this critical stage of
                        change of government?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERNBAUM: Well Beaulac was very much interested in continuing with this policy of
                    strengthening relations with the Argentines. He also had ideas about getting
                    things done. His principle was you got to a country and you found certain
                    problems, and then you devoted yourself to solving these problems. One of them
                    was aviation relations. But at that time when I arrived there we had started a
                    stabilization program with the Argentine government, headed by Arturo Frondizi.
                    He was president of Argentina. Beaulac was very much interested in insuring the
                    success of the stabilization program, and I was heartily in accord with that.
                    This is what we emphasized throughout our period there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was, just to get an idea, Beaulac's way of using you
                        as DCM. A DCM is whatever an ambassador wants him or her to be. And how did
                        he use you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERNBAUM: Well, I think he more or less checked me out to see how much he could
                    rely on me. As he began to feel he could rely on me, then I got more and more
                    responsibility. My primary function as a DCM would be to manage the embassy as
                    executive officer. But then he used me for political purposes as well. He had
                    more or less a hierarchical idea of contacts. He would see the ministers, and
                    then I would see the number twos. And he depended on me more and more to develop
                    these contacts in the Foreign Office and other government departments.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, how did you find running the embassy, the management
                        of the embassy? Was it a difficult job?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERNBAUM: No, no. It wasn't at all difficult. We used to have staff meetings
                    every morning. They was attended by the heads of the various sections of the
                    embassy. Decisions would be taken at these staff meetings, and I would see to it
                    that they were carried out. That was part of my responsibilities, and I'd always
                    check back with the various people who were given the action responsibility for
                    the things.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you felt very much a manager. One of the complaints
                        sometimes is that DCMs turn into a second Political Officer, and leave the
                        management to one side.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>BERNBAUM: This varies with people. It varies with the ambassador, and it varies
                    with the individual DCM. My principle later, when I became ambassador, was to
                    use a DCM as the executive officer. I expected him to be the Embassy
                    bastard.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERNBAUM: He was the one who was expected to see to it that things were done, and
                    not to have them referred to me if they were internal problems involving
                    difficulties with staff. This is one thing I was very careful to do when I was
                    DCM. I took the responsibility for doing things, and avoided having the
                    ambassador faced with unpleasant problems.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A question that we'll turn to in the early posts as
                        ambassador, but I might raise it here. How did you find the embassy staffed?
                        Was it too big, too weighted on the military or the AID side? Or I'm
                        thinking of Lincoln Gordon and his operation Topsy, which he cut out a
                        significant portion of the embassy Brazil.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERNBAUM: Jack Tuthill before him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Excuse me, Jack Tuthill.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERNBAUM: Well, it varied. When I was in Ecuador as DCM, we had a small, lean
                    staff. I thought we functioned very well. I was DCM executive officer,
                    occasionally I'd write political reports, economic reports; always working with
                    the people in charge. Actually at Quito I was also Political Officer as well as
                    DCM.</p>
                <p>When I returned to Quito as ambassador I found a great many more people there. I
                    didn't have the feeling that we were much more efficient.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is a charge that has often been levied. Why had it
                        grown?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>BERNBAUM: Well, bureaucracy, the demands of Congress for information, the
                    progressively greater curiosity of the State Department, the interest of the
                    other government departments to have representation. We would find commercial
                    attach�s there. Of course, we always had military attach�s, but one good example
                    of this; when I arrived in Quito as ambassador, we had one armed services
                    attach�, who covered the three services. I think after the Bay of Pigs problem,
                    President Kennedy was supposed to have made some comment about our ability to
                    have good relations with the military, to know what they were up to. So I had a
                    request to appoint an air attach�. I checked around with our armed services
                    attach�, who in effect said we didn't need one. And after exchanging about two
                    or three telegrams each way, I found myself forced to accept one. Well, the man
                    had nothing to do. He was just a pest, he was always on the back of the MAG to
                    fly their plane and to do things. Eventually I had a request to appoint the
                    Naval attach�. Here we were, two miles above sea level, and they wanted a Naval
                    attach�. Well, I was able to ward that one off.</p>
                <p>I learned later, this is very interesting, that after I left Ecuador we had a
                    reduction in force. And there was an effort to eliminate the air attach�. And
                    our ambassador had become accustomed to having an air attach�, fought tooth and
                    nail to keep the guy, which was an indication of how things worked.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, my understanding, I speak now as a professional
                        Foreign Service Officer too, that the prime function of an air attach� is to
                        have an airplane which can fly you around the country, and for an ambassador
                        often this is considered desirable by an ambassador who likes to use the air
                        attach�'s airplane.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERNBAUM: Well, it's not really the real function of the air attach�.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Granted. But I would say it's conceivable that this is the
                        practical use of one.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERNBAUM: Actually when I was in Ecuador I did have access to US airplanes, but
                    they were in the Air Mission there, and they were always ready to collaborate
                    with me whenever I felt that I needed a plane to furnish one.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: If we could now go to how did you become, get appointed,
                        to Ecuador as ambassador? We're talking about the fall of 19 . . .?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERNBAUM: This was in the fall of 1960.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: 1960?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>BERNBAUM: Yes. Well, I think probably one of the reasons was that I had been in
                    Ecuador before. We were having the problem of an inter-American conference at
                    Quito. And we had a boundary dispute between Ecuador and Peru. The political
                    appointee who had been appointed to be ambassador.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: David Kerrick, who had been Commissioner of the District
                        of Columbia.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERNBAUM: That was it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He died four days after being sworn in as ambassador.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERNBAUM: That's right. And so the question arose as to whom we were going to
                    send. I think probably people in the bureau who were conscious of the need to
                    have somebody with experience and background in Ecuador, because of the
                    inter-American conference that was going to take place there, particularly
                    through Ecuador's dispute, decided to recommend me. The first thing I knew about
                    it, I had no indication whatsoever that I was going to be tapped was a telephone
                    call from Loy Henderson asking me whether I would be interested in being an
                    ambassador.</p>
                <p>I might say my wife was devastated. She wanted to stay in Argentina, enjoying it.
                    She said, “Can't you hold it off?” I said, “Lightning doesn't strike twice in
                    the same place.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course, this appointment was under the Eisenhower
                        administration.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERNBAUM: Yes. And it was reconfirmed. I had not yet been confirmed by the
                    Senate, so after arriving in Ecuador as an interim appointee, I was asked to
                    return to Washington to be confirmed. I was then sized up by the Kennedy group
                    in the White House, who apparently decided I was all right. And so the
                    appointment was renewed and confirmed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you went to Quito in 1960. Did you have any
                        instructions of things you were supposed to do? Goals, problems to solve or
                        to be aware of?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERNBAUM: Specifically the Peru-Ecuador boundary dispute and the inter-American
                    conference to see what I could do to minimize the friction between the two
                    countries.</p>

                <p>BERNBAUM: Well, I felt that we were placed in a very difficult position, because
                    when you get into boundary problems you have a tremendous amount of nationalism
                    and emotionalism. And rational arguments don't frequently prevail. My feeling
                    was that the best way of trying to resolve the problem was to get the two
                    parties to talk. And, if necessary, to go to arbitration, with the idea that if
                    they agreed to an arbitration, perhaps the decision would settle the
                    problem-take say the Ecuadorian government off the hook, or the Peruvian
                    government off the hook. This was one of the main things I was trying to do
                    while I was in charge of South American affairs, and I became very much involved
                    in the Peru-Ecuador dispute. Made a number of trips to both countries. On a few
                    occasions almost got them to talk to each other, and then things would fall
                    apart.</p>
                <p>But this was really the basis of our policy throughout the whole period. Not to
                    take sides, but to get them to talk. And I remember two conversations. One when
                    I was on my way from Buenos Aires to Quito when I stopped off at Lima. Had
                    dinner at our embassy, where I stayed, and the Peruvian foreign minister had
                    been invited, so that we could talk. I listened to him, and he said their legal
                    position was absolutely impeccable. And I said, “Well why then wouldn't you be
                    ready to accept some kind of arbitration? You know, wouldn't this settle the
                    problem for you?”</p>
                <p>And he said, “If I were to try that, the government would be overthrown.” He
                    said, “Because Peru has been in the position of having lost wars to Chile,
                    having lost territory, and this is the first time we beat somebody. And we're
                    not going to let the spoils of that victory go, even take a chance of having
                    that happen.” He said, “The military wouldn't stand for it.”</p>
                <p>Later, after I arrived in Ecuador, I made a point of seeing the various past
                    presidents. I mentioned this problem to one of them. He said that he had learned
                    that the only way you could solve a boundary dispute was to have two strong
                    governments in power who could take the flak from a decision which might not be
                    approved by everybody. He said you've never had a strong government in Peru, and
                    one in Ecuador. They've never coincided, and you never could get a decision.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, the situation was—Peru had fought a small war with
                        Ecuador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERNBAUM: They'd invaded Ecuador, and got as far as Guayaquil. They were
                    interested in annexing a large part of Ecuador, and that's when we stepped and
                    the other guarantor countries stepped in.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is the Rio Pact of 1942, is that it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>BERNBAUM: Not the Rio Pact. That's just what it was called. But the war was
                    on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're talking about World War II.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERNBAUM: Yes, World War II was on. This happened in about '42, and so we forced,
                    well more or less coerced the Peruvians to withdraw and to accept far less than
                    they had originally wanted, and in a sense we would coerce the Ecuadorians to
                    accept some loss. The result was that the Ecuadorian president and foreign
                    minister, who signed that treaty were killed politically.</p>
                <p>But we and the Brazilians and the Chileans became guarantors of this treaty. And
                    the demarcation, or the boundary, was proceeding when an aerial survey conducted
                    by our Air Force revealed the existence of a watershed that had not been known
                    before. And the Ecuadorians seized upon that as a basis for attempting to
                    renegotiate the boundary.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was by the time you had arrived, or just before?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERNBAUM: This happened before I arrived. And that was one of the problems. The
                    Ecuadorians were interested in revising the boundary so that they would have
                    direct access to the Amazon, whereas under the old agreement they would not have
                    had access. The Peruvians claimed that the old agreement was theirs signed,
                    sealed and delivered. The boundary markers were being established and there was
                    no reason not to proceed. So they wouldn't talk with the Ecuadorians about it.
                    And our problem was to try to get them both to talk about it.</p>
                <p>First to, perhaps, sign a commercial treaty, because they had no commercial
                    relations across the border. And the idea was if we could get them talking on
                    the basis of a commercial agreement, perhaps then there would be more of a basis
                    for continuing the conversation politically. And when I was in Peru at one time
                    I saw the Prime Minister and various people. I thought that he had become
                    convinced that this was the thing to do, and I left feeling we were going to
                    have a commercial agreement, but apparently the opponents prevailed on him and
                    he cancelled the idea.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, by December of 1960 you, I think, at that time you'd
                        just about arrived, hadn't you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERNBAUM: I arrived about October.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ecuador had abrogated the treaty?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>BERNBAUM: No. The new president, Velasco Ibarra, made a statement saying that he
                    would not honor the treaty. That the treaty was null and void. And that
                    presented us with a problem. The Peruvians were pressuring the guarantors to
                    denounce the Ecuadorian statement as a violation of the treaty, and my problem
                    was to try to get our government to abstain and not take a position. But we did
                    take a position against the Ecuadorians, and as a result the embassy was stoned,
                    attacked, and we had quite a messy situation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, I notice on this the State Department spokesman,
                        Lincoln White, came out regarding possible collective action if Ecuador
                        maintained its position opposing the treaty.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERNBAUM: I don't remember that strong a statement.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Anyway, I read this in a paper.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERNBAUM: But I do remember that we made this statement supporting the Peruvian
                    position. I remember speaking with our assistant secretary at the time. I said,
                    “For goodness sakes, you know damn well it's not going to solve the problem. By
                    taking sides we're going to be on the wrong side of a nationalist issue in
                    Ecuador, and we're going to have an awful lot of trouble.” And he said, “I
                    know,” but he said, “the pressure here is too great.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, where was the pressure coming from in
                        Washington?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERNBAUM: The former ambassador to Peru had become Counselor of the State
                    Department.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh my.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERNBAUM: And he was predisposed . . .</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERNBAUM: Ted Achilles.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ah, yes. Yes. This is a case of localitis, you think?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERNBAUM: Yes, this was localitis.</p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But this was not coming from business interests, or from
                        the president, it was really internal?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERNBAUM: It was an internal matter, and one problem the Ecuadorians always had
                    was that they were always outmaneuvered diplomatically by the Peruvians. The
                    Peruvians would have an ambassador in Washington who had been there for 15 or 20
                    years, knew everybody. They did the same in Brazil. Same thing in Chile. The
                    Ecuadorians were always changing their ambassadors. So they never really did
                    have the kind of clout in these capitals that would permit them to get their
                    viewpoints across effectively.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well how was this resolved?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERNBAUM: It's never been resolved.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But I assume the stoning of the embassy stopped at a
                        certain point.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERNBAUM: Well, they had gotten it out of their system. We had a bill for broken
                    windows and so forth, and as a result we instituted security measures. We built
                    a fence around the chancery, which was very ugly and I always tried to get rid
                    of it, but I think it's still there. Other security precautions were taken. But
                    we never did have another problem of that kind, because this one event
                    demonstrated to me that we should always make every effort possible to stay on
                    the right side of a nationalist issue, and certainly not to be on the wrong
                    side, because the only thing that would get the crowds moving was nationalism.
                    And we had other problems.</p>
                <p>I think of the Bay of Pigs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the Bay of Pigs, we're talking about the Bay of
                        Pigs in Cuba, the American sponsored attempt to overthrow Castro. Well, how
                        was that a problem as far as we were concerned in Ecuador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERNBAUM: The left wing elements in Ecuador used that to try to rally the crowds
                    against the embassy, but they couldn't do it. The people just weren't that
                    interested, whereas they had been greatly interested on the boundary dispute. It
                    was a nationalist issue involving Ecuador.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, did the boundary question come up every time you had
                        a conversation in Ecuador, or did it sort of die down after a while?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>BERNBAUM: We were continuously making efforts to try to get them to negotiate a
                    commercial agreement. The Ecuadorians were always very partial to that. We never
                    had any problem with them. The problem was to get the Peruvians to do it. And
                    after my effort had failed, the Brazilian foreign office tried it. The foreign
                    minister made a trip to both countries—that failed. Then later apparently the
                    Peruvians had a change of heart, and they sent an ambassador to Quito who had
                    Ecuadorian relatives. I think one of his grandparents had been Ecuadorian, and
                    the idea was that through his contacts in the place, he would be able to work
                    out an acceptable agreement. And I, of course, worked with him for that. But
                    that never went through.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, what were our other interests, besides keeping from
                        getting involved between Peru and Ecuador, what were our interests in
                        Ecuador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERNBAUM: Well, very early in my period there we had the Alliance for Progress.
                    Our prime interest was to further the Alliance for Progress in Ecuador—to get
                    them to accept our assistance and make use of it. We had a problem there.</p>
                <p>The Ecuadorian government, of course, was very much interested in whatever
                    assistance we could give them. They were always a bit suspicious of our motives;
                    they never could quite believe that we didn't want to get some political
                    advantage out of it. I always tried to assure them that wasn't so. But one of
                    their big problems was that they had most of their revenues earmarked for
                    autonomous agencies. It was very difficult then for the government to furnish
                    its share of the projects which were being financed under the Alliance for
                    Progress. That was one of the problems that I had all the time. I used to travel
                    around the country pushing for collaboration. I used to spend a lot of time with
                    the president, who was not very pro-American. He had had problems when he was in
                    the Embassy in Washington.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well now, you were also there at the time when there was a
                        overthrow of one president, and the vice president was put in.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERNBAUM: This is the president that I am referring to.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Arosemena?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERNBAUM: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And that must have put a bit of a strain on our American
                        relationship, because he came out of the left the same time when we were
                        concerned about Cuba and all that.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>BERNBAUM: He was a really complicated individual. His father had been president
                    of Ecuador. He came from one of the first families in Guayaquil. He was more or
                    less a maverick in his community. He was addicted to drinking. He was a
                    dipsomaniac. And somehow or other he always seemed to be interested in stirring
                    things up.</p>
                <p>I remember one time as vice president when he insulted the Chinese ambassador, he
                    was a bit drunk at the time. And another time when he insulted the Colombian
                    ambassador. He always wanted to stick needles in people when drunk. We used to
                    have some conversations about that. His problem was that he couldn't stay away
                    from the bottle, and that made life with him somewhat difficult.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I read that he is described as being a leftist. I
                        mean, was this real, was it because he was just being contrary, or was there
                        concern that he might move closer to Castro when his brand of
                        communism?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERNBAUM: Well, that problem did arise. I had a feeling it was more based on his
                    own personality than any ideological preferences. He was under pressure from the
                    military to break with Cuba, and he didn't want to break with Cuba. I'll always
                    remember this, I can tell it now.</p>
                <p>I was playing golf one Saturday, and his aide came along to say that the
                    president wanted to speak with me. And so I left the course. This was always a
                    topic of conversation between us. He was always kidding me about playing golf.
                    And I said, “Mr. President, you did a terrible thing. I was about to win that
                    tournament, and you pulled me off the golf course.”</p>
                <p>He said, “In a good cause.” He said, “I'm being pressured by the military to
                    break relations with Cuba. What do you think about it?”</p>
                <p>I said, “That's your baby, not mine.” And he tried in every which way to get me,
                    to commit me, to tell him what to do, and I wasn't going to do that. And finally
                    he said, “I'm wondering whether I shouldn't have a plebiscite in the country on
                    that subject. What do you think about it?”</p>
                <p>I said, “I will then express an opinion. You'd just divide the country. It seems
                    to me that would be silly. In that case I'd suggest it would be far better not
                    to break, then to have a plebiscite.”</p>
                <p>That ended the conversation. Later that evening the Minister of the Interior
                    visited the embassy to tell me that the President had broken with Cuba.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, what was he trying to do? To get you to commit
                        yourself and then to say . . ?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>BERNBAUM: He was probably trying to be able to say that he was forced by the US
                    to break.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, at that time it was our policy, wasn't it, was it at
                        Punta del Este or someplace? Wasn't this our policy to try to have the South
                        American countries break with Cuba?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERNBAUM: Oh sure. But the question was, how do you do it. We had Adlai Stevenson
                    visiting. He made a swing around Latin America shortly after Kennedy was
                    elected. One of his purposes was to convince the various governments to break. I
                    remember a conversation we had with President Velasco Ibarra, who was not at all
                    sympathetic. He thought we were a country of cultural barbarians. He was more or
                    less a Francophile, and an Americanphobe. But he did respect Adlai Stevenson,
                    who was one American he thought was a really fine individual. Every time
                    Stevenson would make a point, the old man would rebut him by saying, “Well,
                    governor, in page so and so of the book you wrote, you said something to the
                    contrary.” Or, “You made a speech on a given date where you said something to
                    the contrary.” And finally Stevenson had to give up.</p>
                <p>But aside from that, we never expressed an opinion to the government about what
                    they should do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then Washington was not pressing you to do anything, or
                        were you saying leave it alone, or how was this working, because it was a
                        problem for us at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERNBAUM: I was not being pressured at that time, no.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And were you getting much direction from Washington under
                        the early days of the Kennedy administration?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERNBAUM: Well, there were two problems. One was that President Kennedy had made
                    an imprudent comment to Arosemena's brother that he might invite the Ecuadorian
                    president to visit the United States.</p>
                <p>When I heard about it I wrote to oppose the invitation because of Arosemena's
                    dipsomania and corresponding unpredictability. So the invitation was held off
                    for quite a long time. Finally the Ecuadorian president let it be known that he
                    was awaiting for an invitation.</p>
                <p>There was another problem when there was pressure from Washington interests to
                    get me to do something when Velasco Ibarra was overthrown. At that time there
                    were three candidates for the presidency. The vice president, who was then in
                    jail.</p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The vice president was in jail?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERNBAUM: He was in jail.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERNBAUM: On the ground that he was plotting against Velasco. The president of
                    the Supreme Court was another candidate for the presidency. And I forget whoever
                    else. There were three candidates. The situation looked rather hairy in
                    Washington, and so I had a few phone calls asking what we should do. I advocated
                    not doing anything. I didn't care who was president. Any one of them was
                    perfectly all right, and there was no reason why we should in any way get
                    involved. They accepted that. And eventually it turned out that way. Arosemena
                    became president, and things worked out well until he was overthrown.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, we at least weren't tainted with having
                        meddled.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERNBAUM: No, we stayed out of it. We just refused to get involved. And there was
                    absolutely no reason to get involved, because any one of these people would have
                    been a perfectly good president from our viewpoint.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, turning again to the coming in of the Kennedy
                        administration. You had been a relatively short time in Ecuador.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERNBAUM: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you were brought back. Do you feel was Kennedy sending
                        out a signal that he was going to use the Foreign Service more, as
                        ambassadors?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERNBAUM: Well, there were directives. One written by Eisenhower earlier, and one
                    written later by Kennedy. And the idea was to emphasize the predominant role of
                    the ambassador in embassy operations, in that his views would override those of
                    other agencies that were represented in the embassy. This was a very difficult
                    thing to enforce, but, generally speaking, I never had any problems with any of
                    the representatives of the other agencies. We all collaborated very well.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I'd like to ask, because of the Kennedy directive,
                        which as you say, and just before that the Eisenhower directive, really the
                        first time there were strong signals from the presidency that the ambassador
                        is in charge. But again, this is an unclassified interview, but how well
                        were you served by the CIA do you feel?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERNBAUM: I never had any problems with them. Any time a proposal was made to
                    conduct an operation, I would query them for the reasons. If there was no really
                    serious security involved, say for example something involving the Communist
                    party, I saw absolutely no reason whatever for a intervention, a project by the
                    CIA. And invariably the station chiefs would always say “Fine, we just won't do
                    it.” Sometimes they would be asked by their home office to consider the problem,
                    and in a sense I was taking them off the hook. But I never had any problems with
                    the CIA station chief, nor with anybody else.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You weren't embarrassed by something taking place that you
                        didn't know about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERNBAUM: Well, I think there was one case shortly after I arrived. There had
                    been rioting in Guayaquil. And at that time we had a station chief who seemed to
                    be running for election in Ecuador. He wanted to be a very popular fellow. He
                    was a very attractive personality.</p>
                <p>A Jesuit priest was caught in Guayaquil with ammunition, guns, and was accused of
                    fomenting rioting. He was quoted as saying he was doing it under the supervision
                    of the CIA. I asked our station chief about that. He said, “Absolutely not.” I
                    never was sure that this was so. I remember the Minister of the Interior calling
                    me to complain about it. I reminded the minister that some time before, during a
                    previous administration, he had headed a delegation to me asking whether we
                    would support a coup against that government. I then said, “You remember what I
                    said, don't you? Lay off. It's not the thing to do.” And I said, “Do you think
                    that an embassy that made that kind of a recommendation in the past would
                    support any of the activities that this priest said we were engaged in?”</p>
                <p>He said, “Forget it.”</p>
                <p>But I was never sure about that station chief, whether he told me the truth.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the American military? The military in the
                        Latin American countries always plays a major role, and when our military
                        people go there there's often the complaint, the accusation or what have you
                        that when military man talks to military man, sometimes it's more in the
                        interest of the military, whether it be American or the other country, than
                        in the interests of the country. Did you feel you had control over our
                        military?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>BERNBAUM: I had heard those statements, but I never had any reason to feel that
                    was true where I was, either Ecuador or Venezuela. We always worked closely
                    together. I always had confidence in the military people there, that they were
                    following our policy, and not bypassing it.</p>
                <p>As a matter of fact, there's one factor that I think limited strong military
                    influence. That was the fact that by and large our military people were not well
                    equipped to do their jobs. Very few of them spoke Spanish.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's amazing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERNBAUM: The Army attach� I mentioned earlier was a great exception, and his
                    relationships with the Ecuadorian military were very warm and cordial. But very
                    frequently when the question of an assignment arose, I'd have to say “No, I
                    won't accept this fellow. He doesn't speak Spanish.” I must say that the
                    commanding officer in Panama, the first one I dealt with, supported me entirely.
                    But the later one prevailed on me to accept a few people who didn't speak
                    Spanish. They were not successes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did we have much of a military aid program, a MAG?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERNBAUM: We had a MAG, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: MAG stands for . . ?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERNBAUM: Military Assistance Group or something. Mill group we used to call
                    it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we giving much equipment to the Ecuadorian
                        military?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERNBAUM: Training. It was mostly training, and there would be some equipment,
                    usually on a sale basis.</p>
                <p>One of our problems with the Ecuadorians, particularly after the military junta
                    took over, was to prevent them from buying military equipment. We refused to
                    sell military equipment. We didn't think they needed it or could afford it. I do
                    remember one occasion when they were thinking of buying some war ships from
                    England. I went to Washington and used that as a basis for returning and saying
                    “We take an awfully dim view of this, because you need every cent of your money
                    for the economic development of the country.” I do recall they refrained from
                    buying the war ships.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: To backtrack just a little bit. You said that the Kennedy
                        administration brought you back to sort of look you over. What were they
                        looking for do you think?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERNBAUM: What I looked like. How I spoke. And I think the man with whom I spoke
                    . . .</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERNBAUM: Ralph Dungan, had a pet problem—the AID Program. The “servicios”. He
                    had strong feelings about the “servicios”, he thought they ought to be abolished
                    completely.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The “servicios” are what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERNBAUM: Technical assistant units.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Technical assistance?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERNBAUM: This would be an organization set up to train people in the various
                    ministries to do their jobs. The idea was that this would be a funnel. You'd get
                    the Ecuadorians to go through this training period so that they could be
                    qualified to do their jobs within the government. And apparently the system had
                    become a bit hardened to the point where the Ecuadorians who were going through
                    the system became officials of the system. And so you didn't have that training
                    advantage that we used to have before. They became more or less adjuncts of the
                    ministries. Dungan was zeroing in on that, and I happened to agree with him that
                    the system had become hardened. But when Dungan asked me if I thought we should
                    abolish it, I said no. “It can serve a useful purpose—the thing to do is to
                    reform it, not abolish it. Apparently that wasn't strong enough to make him feel
                    that I was unqualified to do the job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But did you feel any sort of change in the way you were
                        conducting yourself or your mission between Eisenhower and Kennedy, as
                        regards dealing with Ecuador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERNBAUM: The only difference was the Alliance for Progress. That became the
                    dominating feature of our policy. Other than that no difference.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How effective was this in Ecuador, and what form did it

                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>BERNBAUM: Well, intensified training and the granting of loans to do the job that
                    we thought should be done in the country and that they wanted. The main obstacle
                    to that was what I described before. The inability of the Ecuadorian government
                    to furnish its part of the cost. We were asking them to furnish only about 20%
                    of the cost of these projects, and we were extending loans on the basis of no
                    interest for ten years, and in fact were gifts. But I do think that a lot of
                    good had been done, but eventually it deteriorated.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I read a book quite recently in which the author made a

                </p>
                <p>BERNBAUM: Especially down on the coast in Guayaquil area, yes it was bad.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you deal with this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERNBAUM: By trying to maintain tight control over these projects. Every so often
                    I'd find somebody, you know, some prominent local businessman who'd try to take
                    advantage of the program. For example, through currency exchanges. They'd want
                    to be paid in dollars instead of sucres, dollars being worth more than the
                    sucres in terms of the number of sucres they'd get. I remember on some occasions
                    having ministers intervene with me to try to get us to do it. I'd always say,
                    “Look, if you want to feed the kitty of some local businessman, do it
                    yourselves. Don't ask us to do it.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And this was accepted?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERNBAUM: I remember one time the president called me and one of his cronies . .
                    .</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this Arosemena?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERNBAUM: Arosemena. One of his cronies down in Guayaquil had tried to get one of
                    these special arrangements. The minister, who was very close to the president,
                    had tried to get me to agree to it. I refused. Finally the president called me
                    in and he asked me about it. And I said, “I told your minister the reasons why
                    we can't do it.”</p>
                <p>He called the minister and said, “Is this true?”</p>
                <p>And the minister said, “Yes.”</p>
                <p>The President said, “All right, I'm embarrassed. Forget about it.”</p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>But obviously you couldn't prevent corruption, but to the extent we could, we
                    tried to get strict compliance with the loan agreements..</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you see the left wing anti-American force in
                        Ecuador? Did you find it threatening to you, to our purpose there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERNBAUM: I think the most threatening period was during the early part of my
                    stay there. During the Velasco Ibarra period. He had a few left wing ministers
                    in government who were quite anti-American, and who were in some cases,
                    particularly in the case of the Minister of Education, interested in getting the
                    Communist bloc in there to do some technical assistance. We always maintained
                    cordial relations with the ministers, but let them know that if that was what
                    they wanted, they were on their own, and they weren't going to get any help from
                    us. Usually those projects were frustrated. After that, I don't think there was
                    any particularly strong left wing influence in the government.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were the Cubans sponsoring guerrillas or anything like
                        that? I would not think that Ecuador was a prime target.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERNBAUM: We had some minor guerrilla activity, that, as far as I remember was
                    not very serious. The Cubans were implicated but I was never sure to the extent
                    to which the implication was based on logic or fact.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the tuna war going on while we were there, or
                        not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERNBAUM: Very much.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did we handle that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERNBAUM: That was one of my big problems.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was on the front page of the American papers for a
                        period of about ten years.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>BERNBAUM: Well, the three Pacific countries, Ecuador, Peru and Chile, were acting
                    in concert about tuna fishing. Their objective was to assess very high license
                    fees on tuna fishing in their waters. They claimed they had a 200 mile limit on
                    the ground that we had started the problem by claiming a 200 mile limit off our
                    coast for petroleum drilling. We had a continental shelf, which goes out about
                    200 miles and permitted the exploitation of petroleum.</p>
                <p>As the Ecuadorians explained to us, they had no shelf. Although they couldn't use
                    a continental shelf as the basis for their policy, they claimed they had the
                    same right to 200 miles that we did and that usually led to conflict, because
                    they would impound US tuna ships outside of the 12 mile limit. The situation
                    came to a head when during the Kennedy administration, the tuna fleet decided to
                    force President Kennedy's hand, by sailing en masse into Ecuadorian waters, and
                    were intercepted.</p>
                <p>This happened while I was at home to attend my son's graduation from the Exeter
                    Academy in New Hampshire. The Secretary wanted to send somebody there to
                    negotiate the situation but the Ecuadorians refused to accept a negotiator on
                    the grounds that it was really an internal matter. So I had to return. They
                    couldn't refuse to talk to me since I was the ambassador.</p>
                <p>I think the fishermen paid the fine, which we reimbursed. That produced a feeling
                    on our part that we had to reach an agreement with the Ecuadorians on this
                    situation. As a result much of my activity was confined to trying to reach an
                    agreement. Fortunately I found a rather receptive ear in the Foreign Minister,
                    who felt that the conflict was leading nowhere.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this Arosemena?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERNBAUM: No, actually this happened after Arosemena. It was the military junta.
                    We negotiated a confidential modus vivendi. A confidential modus vivendi, in
                    which they agreed to the 12 mile limit, and established norms for the levying of
                    taxes.</p>
                <p>Before I left Ecuador, the next Foreign Minister suggested that we cancel the
                    modus vivendi, and that the government would do its best to apply its
                    provisions, but without a formal agreement. I though that was a good idea,
                    because obviously the agreement was eventually going to blow up. We agreed in
                    Washington when I went back, to do that. But some way or another it never
                    happened. I was in Venezuela at the time. It never happened. The modus vivendi
                    did blow up, and the tuna war started up again.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: With this junta that took over, I noticed in the paper and
                        reading for this interview that one of the precipitating factors in
                        Arosemena's going was a banquet he had had with you, a dinner that he had
                        had with you the night before. Could you describe what happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>BERNBAUM: As background, Arosemena had been involved in various incidents due to
                    drunkenness. One of them was when he met the Chilean president at the airport in
                    Guayaquil and was drunk. It was said that if it hadn't been Christmas he would
                    have been overthrown then.</p>
                <p>Later, Admiral McNeil, president of the Grace Line, visited Ecuador with his
                    wife. The president gave a banquet for them, because the Grace Line had
                    participated in the inauguration of a new vessel. The president's wife had been
                    invited to visit the United States.</p>
                <p>His apartment was above the presidential office, so I showed up there, where I
                    expected the party to take place. He was there with a few of his ministers,
                    including the Foreign Minister. He was already half gone. As I walked in he
                    said, “Ambassador, have a drink.”</p>
                <p>I said, “Well, Mr. President, let's go downstairs, we'll have the drinks down
                    there.”</p>
                <p>We got him down there, and he made a speech decorating the admiral. He neglected
                    to mention my presence. Whenever he was annoyed with the US for one reason or
                    other, he'd neglect to recognize my presence. So I knew something was up.</p>
                <p>During the soup course at dinner, he arose—by that time he was really pretty much
                    under the influence of liquor—and made a long rambling speech in which he
                    attacked the US government for exploiting Ecuador without mercy. Well, of
                    course, you can imagine the reaction at the table.</p>
                <p>He turned to me and said, “You agree with me, don't you, Mr. Ambassador?”</p>
                <p>I didn't know whether to laugh or cry, so I said, “No, Mr. President. When you're
                    speaking of the government, you're speaking of the American people.” He had
                    spoken highly of the American people as being distinct from the government.</p>
                <p>Then he turned to one of his ministers at the other side of the table, and said,
                    “Paco, you agree with me, don't you?” Well, this minister at that point was
                    studying the molding on the ceiling. Finally he said, “No, Senor President.”</p>
                <p>Arosemena got up, and staggered out of the dining room. Dinner continued, and
                    finally we finished. The various ministers came along and said, “You're not
                    going to make anything of this, are you?”</p>
                <p>And I said, “No, under those conditions. I don't know what brought it on, but I'm
                    sure he wouldn't have done it if he was sober.” I remember it was a
                    sub-secretary of Foreign Affairs who came along and said, “It makes no
                    difference what you say.” He said, “The three chiefs of the armed forces who
                    were at that dinner have just decided that this is it. This man's gone too far.”
                    And they just threw him out of power.</p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>Well, what happened the following day was that we were giving a farewell luncheon
                    for our Armed Services attach�, and one of the members of the newly appointed
                    junta, Colonel Gandara, came over to bring his wife. This is quite a
                    coincidence, but it was interpreted by virtually everybody as indicating that we
                    were in on the overthrow.</p>
                <p>I asked Gandara at the time, “What's going on?”</p>
                <p>He said, “Well, we decided that we just had to oust him.” He said, “If we hadn't
                    done it, the ranks would have done it.” And then he left. Arosemena was flown to
                    Panama.</p>
                <p>I reported the incident to the State Department, and it was reported quite
                    accurately in Time Magazine.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How would you describe the military government that took
                        over?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERNBAUM: That was very interesting. Gandara visited me after the military
                    government had taken over. And I asked him what their policy was going to be.
                    And he said, “We want to take advantage of the Alliance for Progress. We don't
                    have any great ideas about what to do, and we'd very much appreciate suggestions
                    from the U. S. government, as well as financial help.”</p>
                <p>And I said, “How long will the junta stay in power?”</p>
                <p>He said, “If we stay in power longer than a year, we will continue in power,
                    because the appetite for the goodies will be too strong. So what we've got to do
                    is to get things done and get out before the year's over.” I reported that back
                    home. That was encouraging, that this man was interested in implementing the
                    Alliance for Progress. We did what we could, but our bureaucracy was a bit too
                    cumbersome to get many of the things done that we'd hope would get done.</p>
                <p>In any case, we recognized on the basis of that conversation, not the first, but
                    more or less in the middle of the recognitions. At the end of a year I called on
                    the Colonel, who had then become a general. I said, “How about it.”</p>
                <p>He said, “It's too late. The appetite has progressed much faster than I had
                    expected.” There was a lot of graft going on. The chief of the Air Force and
                    chief of the Navy were very much involved in graft, and this created some
                    problems with us.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: To move on, how did your appointment to Venezuela as
                        ambassador come about?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>BERNBAUM: It came to me as a great surprise. I'd already been in Venezuela
                    twice.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This would be in 1965?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERNBAUM: Yes. I'd already been there twice, and I had been in Washington for a
                    meeting of ambassadors earlier. I was then asked by both the Secretary and the
                    Counselor of the State Department whether I was ready to leave Ecuador. I'd been
                    there for four years. I said yes. I remember telling Secretary Rusk that I'd
                    never been to Europe when he asked me where I wanted to go.</p>
                <p>He said, “Well, we ought to get you a European assignment.”</p>
                <p>I said fine. And I went to see the Counselor, and he said “Fine.”</p>
                <p>I went to see the Assistant Secretary, and he said “No.” He said, “You're not
                    going to Europe, you're going to stay in Latin America.</p>

                <p>Well, I went back. I knew a change was going to take place pretty soon. And in
                    due course I got the telegram nominating me for Venezuela. And the ambassador in
                    Montevideo to be my successor. I do remember when I talked to Mann about the
                    future I said, “I don't know where I'm going to go. But I want one thing. I want
                    a post where I can pick my own staff. I don't want a post so unimportant that
                    the staff will be thrust upon me, as the case was in Ecuador.”</p>

                    be going to Switzerland, which is not a very important place, but he thought
                    that would be all right. But one of the Europeans wanted it. The only time a
                    Latin American, to my knowledge, broke out of it was Bob Woodward, when he was
                    assigned to Stockholm, and then later to Spain, which is more or less related to
                    Latin America.</p>
                <p>But this is a problem, I remember when I was leaving South American Affairs. I'd
                    been tapped by the Department to go to Tokyo as DCM, and the ambassador there
                    had his own man, one of the network. And so I didn't go there, thank God. And
                    then I was supposed to go to Rome. They asked me whether I'd take a demotion to
                    political counselor, and I said yes. I was interested in Italy. But then one of
                    the men who later became one of my good friends was a member of the old boys'
                    network got the job. I went to Buenos Aires. But this was a problem.</p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>The other problem was that the Latin American governments, the political people,
                    had become accustomed to having Americans who spoke good Spanish and who knew
                    the country and with whom they could relate. So every time you got officers
                    assigned there who didn't speak good Spanish, they'd make things difficult for
                    them. This applied not only to ambassadors, but to senior officers. So we got in
                    the habit of asking whenever nominations from outside the area came up for
                    something like a DCM or a political counselor, how good was his Spanish? It
                    wasn't whether he was familiar with Latin America as much as the language. Every
                    so often somebody who spoke good enough Spanish would be allowed to come in and
                    work.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A quick turn back to Ecuador. How were relations between
                        the Consulate General in Guayaquil, which has always been a rather prominent
                        consular post, since the opening of relations with Latin America, and Quito
                        and the embassy there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERNBAUM: They were always good in my time, both times.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it a useful post there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERNBAUM: Yes, it was a useful and very important post. We always used to
                    encourage them to give us economic and political information. Both the DCM and
                    the ambassador used to go down to Guayaquil periodically to meet with the people
                    there. That is to get to know our people in the Consulate General, and also to
                    meet the leading citizens of Guayaquil. We never had any problems.There was one
                    time during the McCarthy period, this was after I left, when a Consul General
                    there, seemed to be a very staunch McCarthyite. I remember at a dinner party he
                    gave for me, hearing him sound off in front of Ecuadorians about the homosexuals
                    and the Communists in the State Department. That infuriated me. I wouldn't have
                    minded so much if he had confined it to me, but here were Ecuadorians at the
                    table and he made these comments. But that was the only sour note that I ever
                    knew of in Guayaquil.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Returning to Venezuela, did you have any instructions or
                        any goals set when you went to Venezuela. Here you were moving from a
                        relatively poor country to one, which in those days, was named among the
                        rich countries, in which incidentally Japan was not included at the
                        time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERNBAUM: I had no specific instructions. I think they assumed I knew Venezuela
                    very well. I'd been there twice before, and the problem was to maintain good
                    relations. And, of course, I knew that the big problem was the petroleum
                    industry, as was the case when I was DCM there, I focused on the petroleum
                    industry, and spent a lot of time on that. I got to know everybody in the
                    industry, both in the American and British industry, and also the government
                    people.</p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>I had a very big advantage in going to Venezuela, because I knew a great many
                    people there, including many of them who were in positions of power. So that
                    facilitated my job a great deal.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BERNBAUM: Leone, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And this was a popularly elected government?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERNBAUM: Oh, yes. After Betancourt he was elected, and it was an honestly
                    conducted civilian government.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, what were our interests in the petroleum field
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERNBAUM: Assured source of supply. And then, of course, we were interested in
                    the welfare of the American companies operating there. But the main thing was an
                    assured source of supply at a reasonable price.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any particular problems at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERNBAUM: Yes. We had a very serious problem. The Venezuelans had always looked
                    upon themselves as an adjunct to the American petroleum industry, because so
                    much of their industry was conducted by Americans. And so when we started to
                    impose restrictions, starting with Canada, giving Canada preferential position,
                    there was a certain amount of hard feeling about that. But then it became very
                    strong when imports from Canada were taken off the top of the world wide quota,
                    for which Venezuela was eligible. In other words, Canada was not only getting
                    complete access to the market, but its access was restricting the Venezuelan
                    access. I remember I made a point of traveling to all parts of Venezuela. I'd
                    use the Air Force plane, and wherever I went the first question asked me was,
                    “discrimination”. I got to the point that I felt that sometimes the reporters
                    themselves didn't know what “discrimination” was, but it became such an
                    important part of the vocabulary, that was the question they asked. That was a
                    big problem, and I did my best to try to solve that, working out one formula
                    after another.Then the Venezuelans began to retaliate a bit. I recall when they
                    started to do so through the establishment of reference prices, regardless of
                    the price at which petroleum was sold, the taxes would be based on the reference
                    price, which was usually higher. That was a problem.</p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>I remember that after the failure of negotiations they established a very high
                    reference price on fuel oil, which was something on which we were very greatly
                    dependent for the New England industry. I remember complaining to the minister
                    about it. “Look,” he said, “we've tried to do it par lo bueno, now we have to do
                    it par lo malo.” Since you won't collaborate with us, we'll take measures into
                    our own hands. As I had always warned the people back home, “We don't hold the
                    trump cards. They hold them. All they have to do is make these decisions, and
                    there isn't a thing we can do about it.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, where was the preference for Canada coming from? Was
                        this Congress? Or was this a political decision?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERNBAUM: The utilities, along the northern tier were very influential in the
                    legislature. They relied on Canadian oil very greatly for their refineries, and
                    also for their fuel oil. They had enough clout, headed by Senator Humphrey
                    ...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: From Minnesota.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERNBAUM: . . . to get this through. Also there was always a feeling that we had
                    big petroleum interests in Canada as well. Much of the oil coming in from Canada
                    was owned by American firms anyway. This was an assured source of supply. We
                    didn't have to worry about any political shenanigans taking place.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, how did you find dealing with the Venezuelan
                        government? Was there quite a contrast between it and Ecuadorian
                        government?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERNBAUM: It would be the contrast between a self-assured, wealthy government,
                    and a government that depends on help. In a sense you might say it was easier to
                    deal with the Ecuadorians because they were so dependent on us. I found that to
                    the extent that the Venezuelans were dependent on the U. S. market for their
                    oil, it was always possible to discuss problems with them. We never had any
                    serious differences, aside from what I was telling you about when they
                    established these reference prices, and hiked the proportional profits that they
                    took as taxes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That problem of discrimination was never solved while you
                        were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERNBAUM: Eventually it resulted in the expropriation of the American industry
                    after I left. I always had the feeling when I was there that I was sitting on
                    top of a boiling pot, and that some day it was going to explode.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we concerned with the forays of Castro's people into,
                        and terrorists attacks within Venezuela?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERNBAUM: Very much, very much. The first time we got a resolution at a
                    conference in San Jose threatening to retaliate if the Castro Government
                    repeated its interference. This turned out to be only on paper. Castro did it
                    again without any adverse consequences.</p>
                <p>I know the Venezuelans were very much concerned the second time Castro attempted
                    a landing of revolutionaries and arms. The president asked me to discuss this
                    when I got home. He said, “I know you're not going to send Marines to Cuba, but
                    for God's sakes, you can't just ignore it. You've got to do something.” He
                    added, “Our unions are passing a resolution to deny access to Venezuelan ports
                    to any ships touched at a Cuban port.” He said, “Now, that's not much, but it's
                    something.”</p>
                <p>I passed that on back home. Nothing happened.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we doing anything to help in the efforts to put down
                        terrorism in Venezuela at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERNBAUM: With technical assistance, equipment that they needed. We were not
                    involved in their activities against terrorism. They were able to take care of
                    themselves. They didn't need any help.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Speaking of your time in both Ecuador and Venezuela, was
                        there any change in emphasis, would you say, between the Kennedy and Johnson
                        administrations?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERNBAUM: No, the first thing that Johnson said when he became president was that
                    he was going to continue the Alliance for Progress. I know that had a very good
                    reaction in Ecuador when I was there. Whenever I had delegations of people
                    coming in to find out what our policy was going to be, I'd always quote
                    Johnson.</p>
                <p>Then, of course, as time went on, we became more and more preoccupied with the
                    Vietnam problem. The Venezuelans thought we were being silly. Well, they said,
                    “Why don't you tend to your own backyard, and stop worrying about what's
                    happening on the other side of the world.” They said “every penny you spend in
                    Vietnam means that much less you can do for Latin America, which is a lot more
                    important to you. That was their belief.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did they feel about our one big intervention in their
                        backyard, the Dominican Republic?</hi>

                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>BERNBAUM: I hadn't been there very long when that took place. They felt that we
                    jumped the gun. I remember that I returned to the Embassy late one night, about
                    11 o'clock. I had a telephone call letting me know that we had moved in to the
                    Dominican Republic, and asking me to speak with the president. This was 11
                    o'clock at night. I called the presidential palace. He was at that time in a
                    meeting with his cabinet. They were drafting a resolution condemning it. When I
                    spoke with the President about it later. He said, “We think you people jumped
                    the gun, that you exaggerated the threat.” He said, “We didn't think that the
                    opposition elements in the Dominican Republic were that dominated by Castro and
                    the Communist party. At least we had no evidence to that effect.”</p>
                <p>But in any case, they were willing to supply a military contingent to the
                    Dominican Republic on the condition that we would withdraw American troops pari
                    passu. I think we were ready to give an oral commitment. We never put it in
                    writing, so the Venezuelans never did it.</p>
                <p>But they felt not so much opposition to the move, as they felt it was perhaps
                    unnecessary.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about within the Venezuelan public. Were there many
                        student demonstrations, this sort of thing, against us?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERNBAUM: No. The press was involved, the left wing press, of course, was
                    condemnatory, and the rest of the press, as I remember, weren't very happy about
                    it, but there was no great condemnation. No, you didn't find any demonstration
                    of the kind we might have found in Ecuador.</p>
                <p>I'd like to mention something that I perhaps might have discussed during our
                    conversation about my stay in Ecuador. I remember the missile crisis.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Cuban missile crisis?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERNBAUM: Yes. We had gotten the message the day before asking us to let the
                    government know what we were planning to do and why. This was before the
                    announcement was made. So I did get in touch with the government.</p>
                <p>The president was ill. He was in no condition to do anything. And also there was
                    a funeral down in Guayaquil that he had to go to, so I spoke with the vice
                    president and a few of the other ministers about it. I found a really tremendous
                    amount of support for what we were doing in the missile crisis.</p>

                    were doing, and I understand that the same message came through from every other
                    Latin American capital. They were on our side.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BERNBAUM: Yes, I had that feeling. Not necessarily apply only to Secretary Rusk,
                    but there was a feeling that we had other fish to fry. We had Vietnam. We had
                    the Soviet problem, and people were just relying on the Bureau of Inter-American
                    Affairs to handle the situation there. And this is one of the reasons I think
                    why when Castro tried his second landing of ammunition and troops in Venezuela,
                    that there was a limited response from Washington on that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But, in a way this was a blessing, wasn't it, for
                        ambassadors in Latin America, that you didn't have too much micro-managing
                        from Washington?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERNBAUM: That's right. Usually every time there was an attempt to do it, well,
                    we'd ward it off. Yes. That was a blessing, and it also was not a blessing,
                    because it meant that many of the positive things that one wanted to do couldn't
                    be done. There just wasn't that much interest.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You couldn't take initiatives, but you could at least ward
                        off unpleasant interference.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERNBAUM: And to the extent that anything we wanted to do did not involve
                    difficulties with other parts of the world.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How well did you feel you were staffed in Venezuela? I
                        mean, were you well supported? Speaking of the Foreign Services as a
                        staff.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERNBAUM: Well, I had some very good people, and some who were not as good. I
                    always had difficulty in getting good economic people. Economic counselors were
                    a very rare commodity, and very frequently we had to do with second best.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why is it difficult, or why did you find difficulty do you
                        think?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>BERNBAUM: I don't know. I remember one man who had a very good reputation, and I
                    asked for him, but he wanted to be a DCM. The moment he became very well known
                    as a good economic man, then he wanted to go political. So a certain number of
                    the outstanding economic people were siphoned off. But then also I don't think
                    we did enough to develop a cadre of good economic people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q:Did you feel that we did enough on the commercial
                        side?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERNBAUM: Well, the Department of Commerce handled the Commercial Attach�s.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did that work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERNBAUM: Pretty well. They maintained contacts with whom the people in the
                    Department of Agriculture were interested. And they would do their jobs. As far
                    as I remember, there was never any problem with them. They would always
                    collaborate, and work as part of a team.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, in Venezuela I know there was a rather bad
                        earthquake. Did this have much of an effect on you? This was in July of
                        1967.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERNBAUM: Yes, I remember that. I was having dinner with friends when the
                    earthquake hit. I remember those streets undulating, and the cars outside going
                    backwards and forwards. And the chauffeurs rolling with them. It was a very
                    scary experience.</p>
                <p>A few of the buildings collapsed completely because of inadequate construction.
                    We helped to the extent that we could, not so much in a monetary sense, but
                    sending immediately our best technical people to help them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How would you describe relations with Venezuela during the
                        time you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERNBAUM: I found that relations during my time were very good. I never had any
                    problem with anybody. I always found all the ministers very cooperative. I
                    always had access to the president whenever I wanted to see him. The only
                    problem was “discrimination” which would arouse hackles here and there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But in a way that was because of what we did, rather than
                        what they did.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERNBAUM: That's right. With the exception of that, I thought relations were very
                    good.</p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you also were there during the time when there was a
                        party out of power replaced the party in power without a coup, or revolt or
                        anything else like that. It was a good solid stable situation.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERNBAUM: It was even more impressive because of the character of the vote. The
                    COPEI beat Accion Democratica by a narrow margin with only about 38% of the
                    electorate. There were some fears in COPEI at the time that AD might not go
                    along with the electoral result, but they did. There has since been an
                    alternation of power, not by design, but more or less by the way things
                    went.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did Perez Jimenez cause you any problems? He was sort of a
                        loose cannon still at the time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERNBAUM: Do you mean when I was DCM and he was then in power?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, I'm thinking of when you were ambassador. He came back
                        and ran for Congress.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERNBAUM: He never came back to Venezuela. He had his supporters putting him up,
                    and I think he was elected, but he never dared return to Venezuela.</p>
                <p>I used to have some problems at the beginning because of the supporters of Perez
                    Jimenez used to come in to complain about the failure of the Venezuelan
                    government to bring him to trial. They felt it was the obligation of the United
                    States to pressure the Venezuelans. I realized this was a subject that in which
                    I didn't want to get involved. We always received them, but I always had the DCM
                    see them. They therefore had a feeling that they had access to the embassy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left the post in 1969.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERNBAUM: July of '69, as a matter of fact.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this by plan? I mean were you ready to go at that
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERNBAUM: Well, I'd been there for four years. It had been over four years, so it
                    was really time for me to go.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you go into retirement at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>BERNBAUM: Well, I let it be known that I was going to retire. I didn't expect to
                    have any appointment by Nixon. We had a problem during his Latin American trip
                    in '58.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you describe it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERNBAUM: Well, he felt that I was not supportive of what he had done in Peru. I
                    think that was mentioned in his Six Crises. Well, I was rather critical of what
                    he had done. So I never did expect an appointment by Nixon, I let it be known
                    that I was going to retire after leaving Venezuela.</p>
                <p>I stayed on until the following April or May to act as a consultant on the study
                    being conducted on our petroleum policy. When that was finished, I retired.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Looking back on your career, particularly the time we're
                        focusing on in Ecuador and in Venezuela, what might you point to as sort of
                        the things that you did that gave you the greatest sense of
                        satisfaction?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERNBAUM: Well, I helped prevent a coup against Guyana while I was in
                    Venezuela.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERNBAUM: We had gotten word that there was a coup brewing in Guyana, in the
                    Rupununi area; that some of the Venezuela military were sympathetic to the coup,
                    and planned to move in after the coup started on the grounds of preventing
                    violence.</p>
                <p>I let the president's number one assistant know about it—that it was a discovery
                    I had made in which the President would be interested. I think it was Christmas
                    morning. There was a coup attempt made, but no Venezuelan participation. I felt
                    that I had done that.I felt also in Ecuador that I had at least helped delay a
                    crisis in the tuna fishers' problem by negotiating that agreement.</p>
                <p>I also felt that in Venezuela I had established a feeling on the part of the
                    Venezuelans that the American government was really interested in trying to
                    solve the problem—that we were more or less on the hook both ways, and that if
                    we could find a way out, we would be very happy to do that. And that created a
                    considerable amount of confidence within the Venezuelan government and
                    facilitated operations there.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the reverse side. The sort of major
                        disappointments, things that didn't work out that you can think of, major or
                        minor?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERNBAUM: Well, one major disappointment was that we were not able to resolve the
                    petroleum problem.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERNBAUM: I was interested in Western Hemisphere preference, which I hoped
                    would....</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was for petroleum products?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERNBAUM: That would apply not only to Venezuela, but to Columbia and all the
                    other countries of Latin America. It would stimulate exploration and production
                    in those countries, and give us an assured supply of petroleum in case of
                    emergency. Because you couldn't count on the Persian Gulf or North Africa as
                    much as you could Latin America. I was disappointed that that never went
                    through.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this mainly because of lack of interest, or because of
                        pressures within Washington?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERNBAUM: Well, I think probably the petroleum industry in the US wasn't
                    particularly happy about that. The Independent Oil Producers Association wanted
                    to control production. One of the ways was to maintain a quota on imports into
                    the United States.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you were up against a very powerful lobby?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERNBAUM: Yes. And then, of course, you had a problem because Johnson came from
                    Texas. So there wasn't much he could do about it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, no.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERNBAUM: That was one thing. And the industry, I think, was not happy about the
                    idea of giving Venezuelans a preference. They had other sources of supply, and
                    they were afraid, I think, that if the Venezuelan government got too much
                    participation, they'd lose clout. Well, they lost clout anyway.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One final question. Looking back on it at that time, how
                        did you find the Foreign Service as a career, and through your knowledge of
                        it today, how do you see it today?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERNBAUM: Oh, I found it the most satisfying career I could possibly have entered
                    into. I mean I felt very fortunate, being a person who when he left it said, “If
                    I had it all over to do again, I'd do it.”</p>
                <p>I don't think it's as good today as it used to be. It was an all-career
                    operation. Perhaps I'm influenced by experience in Latin America, where we had a
                    lot more autonomy until the crisis. But I think now there's a lot more politics
                    involved.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There's not the clear sort of career pattern as you had.
                        You moved through a series of DCMships, and then you moved from one
                        ambassadorship to another.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERNBAUM: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where today it seems to be more the pattern you may get
                        one ambassadorial assignment before you're more or less put out to retire,
                        and it's a reward rather than working up, so you do it as a profession.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BERNBAUM: There was also, I think, a feeling amongst the Foreign Service Officers
                    that this was it. This was the thing. It wasn't a job, it was a career. And I'm
                    not so sure that applies as much today. I find a certain amount of
                    discouragement within the Foreign Service people I see.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I've noticed the same. Well, Mr. Ambassador, I want to
                        thank you very much for this. I have enjoyed this talk, and I'll be getting
                        back to you.</hi>
