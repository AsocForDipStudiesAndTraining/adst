                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is April the 29th 1994. This is an interview with
                        William W. Lehfeldt, Bill, a friend of mine. This is being done on behalf of
                        the Association for Diplomatic Studies and I'm Charles Stuart Kennedy. We're
                        doing this at DACOR Bacon House.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Bill, I know that you were born in California in 1925. Could you give me some of
                    your background, a bit about your family, your parents and all, what they were
                    doing; and then about your early upbringing.</p>
                <p>LEHFELDT: I'm a product of the move West. My forebears on my mother's side, are
                    old-line people in Kentucky and Virginia and Pennsylvania. Her parents moved to
                    Galesburg, Illinois, where she was born. Then her father, who was an engineer on
                    the Burlington &amp; Northern, I guess it was in those days, moved to Montana
                    where they homesteaded in the old Huntley Project. They were one of the first
                    homesteaders there. That's where my mother met my father, who is the product of
                    a German background family that settled in Iowa, where he was born in
                    Dennison.</p>
                <p>His father, my grandfather, who was an Iowa State Senator at one point, a man of
                    some substance in Iowa. He established way back then a system of bringing skinny
                    lambs by rail from Montana through Dennison, Iowa where they off-loaded the
                    skinny ones and on-loaded the fat ones for the market in Chicago, which was a
                    saving of a good deal of freight cost.</p>
                <p>My father, who was the single surviving son of my grandfather's second wife, he
                    had 3 sort of mail-order brides I think from Germany. When my grandfather
                    remarried the third time, after the second wife (my grandmother) had died of
                    measles along with my father's three sisters, he sent my father to Montana. He
                    was then 12 years old and knew no English although born in the United States.
                    Dennison was a German town: German opera, German newspaper, German schools—when
                    he went to Montana to live, sort of exiled to get away from the third wife I
                    guess, he went to his first English speaking school. He told me many years ago
                    that his teacher put him into the back of the room because the only English
                    words he knew were swear words. At any rate, he grew up between Montana and
                    Iowa; attended Iowa State then went back to work in Iowa on his father's ranch.
                    He met my mother there who was then 18 or 19, a school teacher.</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The West must have been absolutely populated with school
                        teachers cause you hardly hear of anybody whose father didn't marry a school
                        teacher.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHFELDT: My three brothers and one sister who later died, were born in Montana.
                    They drove from Montana to California. My father traded the ranch in Livingston,
                    Montana for a ranch in Livingston, California. They drove in 1917 from Montana
                    to California in a Grant, a grand old automobile. I've got pictures of it with
                    my mother and father, and the four kids on the way to California.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Driving them must have been something.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHFELDT: It was a real chore. My eldest brother, who is now 83, can remember
                    some of it; the others don't remember very much of it.</p>
                <p>My father had a dairy, a rather large one. He was a member of the board of a
                    bank, the school board and all that sort of thing. Then California put in
                    tuberculosis testing and he lost 95% of his herd. Of course in the early 1920s
                    there was a good deal of depression even then and he went bankrupt. We moved,
                    before I was born, from the dairy to a farm that he both leased and bought, in
                    the middle of a Japanese settlement in San Joaquin Valley called the Yamata
                    Colony. It still exists; all my neighbors when I was born, all my school
                    friends, all my childhood friends through Pearl Harbor were mostly
                    Japanese-Americans.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where was this? Near Bakersfield?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHFELDT: No, it was north near Merced, between Merced and Modesto. It is Gallo
                    wine country along with Foster Farms which is the West coast version of
                    Perdue.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Chicken farms.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHFELDT: It's all headquartered in that area but it's also a rich center for
                    lots of fruits, apricots, almonds, peaches, etc. It is known to some as the
                    sweet potato capitol of the world allegedly, and a few other things.</p>
                <p>Besides the Japanese, who were important but sort of inward looking, there were a
                    lot of Portuguese, some Italians, some Filipinos. A lot of Mexicans, most of
                    them working as day-laborers on the railroad, the watermelon patches and all
                    that sort of stuff.</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>So that my childhood, both through grammar school and high school, was a mixed
                    culture sort of background. Livingston, a farm town really, when I left there
                    were 711 people in it, now it's up to almost 10,000 I think. It was an
                    interesting and great place to grow up.</p>
                <p>The San Joaquin Valley was still pretty much desert. Water hadn't come
                    everywhere. They depended on rain even though it was inadequate. We did have a
                    couple of irrigation systems, the Tuolumne and Stanislaus River systems and the
                    Merced system were in their infancy but we had irrigation water rather
                    broadly.</p>
                <p>Most of us learned to swim in the irrigation ditches in the summertime. We didn't
                    have private swimming pools. There was something called the Rookledge Corners
                    Plunge which was a real treat during the summer. But most of us learned to swim
                    in the irrigation ditches. At any rate, that's where I went to school.</p>
                <p>When World War II began, just as an example of the importance of the Japanese, my
                    high school which had over 400 students was reduced to under 200 when the
                    Japanese were moved out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was such a traumatic and sort of dark episode in
                        recent American history. What was the attitude at the time? How did you feel
                        about it and your family feel about this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHFELDT: Most of them were church friends of ours, they were either
                    Presbyterians or Methodists. Unlike other parts of California, in the Livingston
                    area no Japanese family sold or lost their property. A committee was set up,
                    including my father, to manage their farms while the were gone. So when they
                    came back, although their farms may not have been as well managed, they still
                    had an income while they were gone and they had a place to come to when they
                    came back from their “relocation.”</p>
                <p>So as a result many of my Japanese friends are now millionaires. They were very
                    successful. Some of the side effects of the dispersal of the Japanese around the
                    country you can see, just in microcosm, in Livingston.</p>
                <p>I don't know whether you remember a singer by the name of Pat Suzuki, she's from
                    Livingston. She starred in THE FLOWER DRUM SONG on Broadway. I remember her as a
                    little 5 year old girl belting out “God Bless America” in 1941. Then she went
                    on, of course, to bigger things.</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>The Chairman of the Biology Department of Dartmouth was a Livingston Japanese.
                    The head of surgery at Cleveland Medical School was Ida Nakashima, one of my
                    sister's classmates. Joe Kamiya, who was one of the discoverers of the Alpha
                    wave, and a professor at the University of California at Berkeley. He went to
                    school in the East, of course, but was a product of Livingston. These were high
                    class people. They all had the drive to succeed and they have succeeded both at
                    home and outside. I think without the war experience, many of them would not
                    have done what they have done.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's a horrible thing but sometimes a kick from the behind
                        gets people, including many of the people in the Foreign Service, dragged
                        into the army or something like that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHFELDT: There are a couple of members of my Livingston friends in the Foreign
                    Service, Japanese, they're retired.</p>
                <p>Back to your original question, what did we feel at home.</p>
                <p>We felt a great loss of friendship. There were certain people in the community,
                    including the editor of our weekly newspaper, who were very anti-Japanese.
                    Curiously enough his grandson, Delwin Roy, is the head of the Hitachi Foundation
                    here in Washington. There was this undercurrent, there was this suspicion, that
                    was built up during that time of possible sabotage and espionage.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about your dad? Your name is Lehfeldt, we were at war
                        with Germany and Japan. Was anybody pointing out the off thought behind
                        this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHFELDT: Curiously enough, at least to me, that never was raised. Of course it
                    was in World War I.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: My grandfather was a Civil War veteran, whose name was
                        Laukner, had real problems in Chicago.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHFELDT: But World War I was different. That's what broke up, for instance, my
                    father's hometown in Iowa which was a German town. World War I came around and
                    they deserted the German language, the German newspaper became English language,
                    all that sort of thing.</p>
                <p>But I never felt German particularly. My father didn't speak German, I guess he
                    knew it. I remember when he visited Iowa once to visit his stepmother. She was
                    in her 90s then. She asked him to stop by to pick up some “mehl”, he stopped at
                    the post office. What she wanted was flour so his German was a more than a
                    little rusty.</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>But no, that never became a problem.</p>
                <p>So in 1943 when I was graduated from high school I immediately went into the
                    Army. Again, the question never arose.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you do in the Army?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHFELDT: I first went into what was then known as the ASTP program, the Army
                    Specialized Training Program. I was first sent to Fort Benning for basic
                    training, I along with a number of other kids. It was an astounding experience
                    because I had never—this brings to mind that last night I saw Schindlers' List—I
                    had never met a Jew before in my life. Here I was, in a 20-man hut in the
                    Harmony Church area in Fort Benning, and 18 out of the 20 were Jews.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: ASTP was a program where they gave the equivalent of an IQ
                        test and the high achievers were set off.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHFELDT: We were supposed to become specialists. I was to study electrical
                    engineering, of all things, because I was good in mathematics and chemistry, I
                    was assigned to Pomona College in California. When we were all ready to go to
                    our colleges they canceled the program and shipped our behinds off to, in my
                    case along with 10,000 other ASTP trainees, to the 94th Infantry Division in
                    Camp McCain (near Grenada), Mississippi. There we trained and then went over to
                    Europe in time for a great deal of the festivities there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think it's important to get a feel for who the people
                        are in the Foreign Service, what were you doing in the 94th?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHFELDT: I was a plain old infantry man, 17 and 18 years old at the time. I
                    became a BAR man, a Browning Automatic Rifleman, which was a very heavy thing. I
                    was pretty good at it. When we landed in France after D-Day, I wasn't in on
                    D-Day, our division was sent immediately over towards Brest, Lorient and St.
                    Nazaire, to close those pockets or at least hold them. When the Battle of the
                    Bulge began they shipped the whole division immediately over to the Saar-Moselle
                    (Luxembourg) area where we spent most of the rest of the war.</p>
                <p>I was one of 7 in my company, including the cooks, that were never wounded or
                    evacuated for frostbite or anything of that sort. At the end of the war, we
                    ended up in Czechoslovakia in the Third Army after having helped close the Ruhr
                    pocket. We crossed the Saar River; took part in the clearance of the Rhineland
                    and took the major cities of Trier and Ludwigshafen. I was just an infantry man
                    but rose to be a platoon sergeant at the end of the war.</p>

                <p>I might add I spent 3 days in Paris over VE Day on leave from the front. I went
                    to the Opera on VE night, believe it or not! As I recall it was an opera I
                    didn't know, my recollection was it was a Massanet opera, Semiramis, which I
                    still have never heard again I don't think.</p>
                <p>I applied to go to one of those army schools that they set up I Europe. I was
                    sent to Biarritz in France for 3 months, from September until the end of
                    December 1945. Studied things like Algebra and Spanish, public speaking and
                    voice, played in the band and had a good time. I enjoyed Biarritz very much,
                    that's where I first ran across the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>I was impressed because in 1945 someone drove by in a brand new American car,
                    non-military, flying the American flag. It was the vice consul. I thought, gee,
                    that's interesting.</p>
                <p>I went back home and was discharged in January or February of 1946. I spent a
                    year in California in school in what is now the University of the Pacific before
                    I discovered what I wanted to do. I knew I wanted to go to college. That was
                    never in question. For all my brothers and my sister even in the depths of
                    depression, there was never any question but that they were going to university.
                    They're all university graduates and they are all in the teaching game. I
                    decided I didn't want to have anything to do with teaching.</p>
                <p>One of my friends at Pacific was a fellow by the name of Alex Roessler, a mixed
                    Mexican-Dutch parentage from New Mexico, killed in the Korean War. He had a
                    catalog for the Georgetown School of Foreign Service which I looked at and
                    thought now that sounds like something I want to do. So I wrote back and applied
                    and they accepted me and I came back here in early 1947.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: My headquarters are in Georgetown University. Could you
                        tell me something about the School of Foreign Service at Georgetown in this
                        period. Most of the people, I assume, were veterans. What was your attitude,
                        were they pushing anything, a little about that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHFELDT: The School of Foreign Service at that time was still sort of a
                    stepchild of Georgetown University. Foreign Service School students could not
                    live on campus for instance, only College denizens could. There was a very
                    definite caste system.</p>
                <p>The School was housed, except for some classes in Healy building, in temporary
                    buildings across 37th Street. That's where most of our class activities took
                    place. On the faculty, there was very little religious evident in the faculty of
                    the School of Foreign Service at that time. Father Walsh who was the Dean and
                    the founder of the School, was still teaching. I took a course in either logic
                    or ethics from him.</p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>Most of us were veterans. There were a few non-veterans but most were veterans.
                    Some of them did some surprising things.</p>
                <p>We had an old professor by the name of William Boyd Carpenter who taught
                    Political Science. It was his wont to come into the class (he was a Chinese
                    scholar and knew a number of different languages), and write something on the
                    board. Usually nobody could identify what it was. One day one of the veterans
                    got up, slammed his books together, picked them up and walked out. This was the
                    last time that Boyd Carpenter wrote anything on the Board. It was in some
                    Chinese dialect that said, “If you can read this you are excused. Please get up,
                    take your books and go home.”</p>
                <p>Many of the professors were also government officials of one sort of another. One
                    required course that was the bane of everybody's existence was only given on
                    Friday nights from 8 till 10:00, a course called INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION. The
                    teacher was John Hickerson, Assistant Secretary of State for International
                    Organization Affairs, or UN Affairs I guess it was called in those days.</p>
                <p>This was really a chore. We couldn't fail the course. We had to be there, we had
                    to sign-in. I took courses at 7 in the morning, day and night.</p>
                <p>But the veterans were serious students, anxious to make up for lost time, and
                    were by and large responsible for changing the character of the whole of
                    Georgetown, I believe, in the late 40s. The church authorities, who were then
                    running Georgetown, didn't know quite how to deal with these guys. I remember
                    the Freshman handbook that I first got had a note in it saying: Informal attire,
                    by whatever name it is called, is unbecoming a Georgetown student. Which meant
                    we were required to wear coat and tie according to the handbook. The veterans
                    wouldn't do it, they weren't about to put up with that nonsense.</p>
                <p>But they were serious students; they achieved a lot. One of my classmates worked
                    with Douglas South Freeman and after Freeman's death completed</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: “Lee's Lieutenants” and “George Washington”.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHFELDT: And won a Pulitzer Prize for his work. He was one of the real snazzy
                    dressers in our class.</p>
                <p>I was surprised frankly how few got into the Foreign Service. Most of them went
                    into business, many of them are around here. In those days we had several
                    fraternities who had houses off campus, they have since been forbidden by the
                    University.</p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>I belonged to something called Delta Sigma Pi which was technically, and it still
                    exists at Georgetown, a Business Administration and Accounting fraternity. It
                    was social just as far as we were concerned, just as much as Delta Phi Epsilon
                    which is the Alpha chapter of the Foreign Service fraternity around the country.
                    Foreign Affairs fraternity I guess it's called, they're still on the corner of
                    Prospect and 35th Street.</p>
                <p>There was Kappa Kappa Alpha, another Business Administration fraternity, there
                    were 3 or 4 of them.</p>
                <p>At any rate what I was getting to, the membership was close-knit and mostly
                    veterans. At the end some non-veterans of course came in but most of them went
                    into business. We still see each other quite a lot. We're rather close friends
                    although we don't work together many of us.</p>
                <p>One of my classmates, for instance, was Bob Anders who frankly didn't have a
                    distinguished Foreign Service career but he was stuck in Tehran and came out
                    through the Canadian caper. Another was Bob Bee who was Treasury Rep in Turkey
                    and Sweden and in Germany. He became an AID official in Pakistan and then later
                    senior vice president of Wells Fargo. In later years he's been running his own
                    bank in London.</p>
                <p>Dick Bloomfield is a classmate, Frank Ortiz is a classmate (both Ambassadors).
                    Joe Cunningham was a classmate. He was the one with the highest score, at that
                    time, ever in the Foreign Service exam. But he ran afoul of someone in
                    Luxembourg, as I recall, and didn't fulfill his promise. He was a very brainy
                    guy.</p>
                <p>A number of others have distinguished themselves in one way or another but most
                    of them went into business and still are great supporters of the School of
                    Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You graduated when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHFELDT: 1950.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHFELDT: I immediately, because one of my friends at school ran the Diplomatic
                    Courier Service, Ed Brennan, went into the State Department as a diplomatic
                    courier in September 1950 and spent the next, almost a year, doing courier work
                    until I passed the exams. I discovered quickly that while being a diplomatic
                    courier was great fun. You didn't get any place except around.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did a diplomatic courier do in 1950?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHFELDT: I was technically a trainee for most of my time in the courier service.
                    We would leave Washington with the classified mail. One night I left Washington
                    with 26 pouches weighing almost 2 tons to accompany down around the Latin
                    American circuit. I dropped many of them in Puerto Rico, a lot of them in
                    Cuba.</p>
                <p>These were crossover points for other couriers to pick them up and take them to
                    other posts. It was a very complicated and intricate system that couriers worked
                    in those days. Of course the coding system, the cryptography system was nowhere
                    nearly as adequate and quick and easy as it is now. We depended on written
                    material being moved back and forth. The 28 bags, whatever it was, was mostly
                    cryptography equipment.</p>
                <p>On one of my early trips in November 1950, I left Washington the day that the
                    Puerto Rican nationalists shot up the Blair House and the House in Congress. My
                    first stop was in Puerto Rico where I was greeted by armed guards with jeep to
                    escort me with all my bags. I was taken to, I forgot the name of the military
                    base, and spent a day or night there. Then on to Havana and on to Guayaquil,
                    Ecuador, where there was an election going on. The vice consul who met me at 2
                    in the morning was Pete Vaky (later a Vice Dean of the Foreign Service School),
                    another Georgetown graduate. He was vice consul at that point.</p>
                <p>It was fun. We'd get to stay overnight or as much as 2 or 3 days sometimes in
                    very nice places. I remember spending 2 and a half days in Barbados waiting for
                    the plane system to work so that we could get out again. I spent several
                    pleasant days over Carnival in Trinidad, a couple of days in Buenos Aires. I got
                    rained in, in a sense, because that was before the main highway from La Guaira
                    to Caracas was completed. There was an hour and a half winding road, up and
                    down, that was all washed out. I was stuck in Caracas for over a week.</p>
                <p>Another time in Caracas was when they shot Delgado Chalbaud who was the head of
                    the military junta at the time. That was when Perez Jimenez took over. Again I
                    was stuck for another week in Caracas, curfew and all that stuff.</p>
                <p>But the nuts and bolts of the courier service was really to move things as
                    quickly as possible. It was an intricate question of scheduling using available
                    airlines.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You completed this after about a year you had took the
                        Foreign Service exam.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHFELDT: I took it 3 times.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're among many.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>LEHFELDT: That was the old 3 and a half day ordeal which was interesting. I took
                    it when I was a junior, when I was a senior and the year I graduated. I finally
                    passed it.</p>
                <p>In between the time that I was sworn in as a Foreign Service office and I left
                    the courier service, I joined the Bureau of United Nations Affairs as an
                    administrative assistant in what was called UNI, Office of International
                    Administration. We were responsible for the administrative participation in
                    international organizations worldwide. I used to supervise our participation in
                    something called, a whole bunch of little organizations, called the
                    International Commission for the Cape Spartel and Tangier Lighthouse. It was an
                    8 nation organization. There was another one, International Commission for the
                    Standardization of the Screw, so on down the line.</p>
                <p>It was sometimes interesting, sometimes just plain boring but I worked with a lot
                    of interesting people. George Ingram and Bill Hall, Joe Sisco, a junior officer
                    at the time; Bob Sayre, Bill Bowdler, Carol Laise were all colleagues of mine
                    and friends.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you came into the Foreign Service was there
                        training?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHFELDT: When I came in I came in as a Foreign Service office class 6 in
                    September 1952. We had junior officer training. There were 22 of us in the class
                    including 2 women. No other minorities of any sort. Most of my colleagues, there
                    were a few who didn't make it, were very successful. One or two died but you
                    know Jack Linehan, Mike Newlin, Bill Edmondson, Dick Barnebey, Jim Goodby all
                    became ambassadors. They were very good.</p>
                <p>We spent the requisite, I think it was 3 months, as junior officer trainees then
                    we all went off to our new posts roughly the end of December 1952.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHFELDT: I went first to Kabul, Afghanistan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHFELDT: From the end of December 52 till the early part of 55. I was on loan to
                    the aid program.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it call AID at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>LEHFELDT: It was called TCA, Technical Cooperation Administration. The ambassador
                    was Angus Ward of Mukden fame. He didn't quite know how to deal with me because
                    I was technically a Third Secretary, Vice Consul. I had the diplomatic titles
                    but I was out of his control in the AID program, he didn't like it but I was the
                    only administrative help the mission director had. At that point a fellow by the
                    name of Bill Hayes who was an old TVA, Tennessee Valley Authority official,
                    quite able.</p>
                <p>The major project we had was something called the Helmand Valley Development
                    Project. There were 2 dams built by the Morrison-Knudsen Company in the
                    southwest part of Afghanistan on the Helmand and Arghandab Rivers. The Helmand
                    Dam and the Kajakai Dam. They were funded to begin with by their Karakul and
                    beryllium and other export earnings amassed during World War II. They also got
                    some loans from the Export-Import Bank and the World Bank. We were charged with
                    providing a technical assistance team to help them administer the whole project.
                    My title was administrative assistant for the Helmand Valley although I was
                    headquartered in Kabul. I did everything for the mission director. I worked on
                    some mining projects, we had health and education projects and so on in all
                    parts of the country. But I did get to Helmand Valley quite often.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you see at that time, we're talking about 52 to
                        55, what were American interests in Afghanistan?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHFELDT: Well, rather slim. We didn't have any investments to speak of. They had
                    a couple of strategic materials, beryllium being the principal one. That was
                    about it. They had no oil at that time.</p>
                <p>The Soviets hadn't really begun to do anything in Afghanistan at that time. The
                    Afghans had applied to be taken in under the Truman Doctrine which was designed
                    to help Greece and Turkey. Of course the Afghans at that time enjoyed bad
                    relations with everybody—with the Iranians, with the Russians, with the
                    Pakistanis and, of course, the Brits who were largely suspected of being the
                    b�tes noires behind everything that went wrong for the Afghans.</p>
                <p>There were the 3 Afghan-British wars, the Afghans asserted they won all 3 of
                    them. They did win two. The 3rd, one which was at the end of World War I, was a
                    little dubious. At any rate, on Independence Day they would parade all their
                    captured British guns and so forth. It was kind of a rag tag army.</p>
                <p>They applied to join a lot of things. They wanted military aid because they were
                    afraid of the Russians. Mr. Truman turned them down flat as did President
                    Eisenhower.</p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>It was a country that was largely tribal and kept together by tribal loyalties.
                    that was the role of the Royal family in those days, to serve as the glue. The
                    King was the son of one of three the brothers who had taken power after a guy
                    that was known as Bacha Saqao (literally Water Boy), who had replaced Amanullah
                    as King. Bacha Saqao was an illiterate but charismatic commoner. Saqaos still
                    brought water around in their goat goatskins in my day, it was alleged to be
                    pure drinking water, but you had to boil it. Bacha Saqao led an uprising that
                    tossed out Amanullah who was trying to emulate Ataturk and modernize
                    Afghanistan, if that can be imagined. According to popular understanding,
                    Amanullah's downfall came because he tried to remove the turbans from the men.
                    He built a number of palatial offices outside of town, in his new capital Darul
                    Mo-alamein. He built the first railroad between the new headquarters for the
                    government and downtown Kabul. You can still see some of the remains of that. It
                    was destroyed when Bacha Saqao took over.</p>
                <p>But then the elite leaders of many of the tribes, the Mohammedzai being the
                    principal group and the group from which the royal family came, took power.
                    There were 3 or 4 brothers—Shah Mahmoud, Wazir Ali, —neither of which became
                    king, and Nadir Shah who did indeed become king. I guess maybe just the 3.</p>
                <p>At any rate, when I got there King Zahir, the son of Nadir who as assassinated in
                    1932, who is still alive near Rome, was the King, he was considered a sort of
                    figurehead, but an important one. His uncles, assisted by some first cousins,
                    were running the country; Shah Mahmoud was the Foreign Minister. They were all
                    running it—one was the Prime Minister, the Foreign Minister and the Defense
                    Minister.</p>
                <p>Later on as the older generation passed on, the cousins of the King became more
                    prominent. Prince Naim became the Foreign Minister succeeding Shah Mahmoud; his
                    half-brother, Prince Daud, became Defense Minister, etc. He later became Prime
                    Minister and finally, president, after deposing his cousin.</p>
                <p>It was Prince Daud who decided that since the US wasn't going to help then he
                    would seek to take some limited help from the Russians in terms of military
                    assistance.</p>
                <p>I have 2 periods of association with Afghanistan, I was later the Afghan Desk
                    Officer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why don't we concentrate on the 52 to 55 period.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHFELDT: At that time it was still pretty much the old men who were running the
                    show.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have much contact with the Afghan government?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>LEHFELDT: Yes I did, partly because I was the only guy in TCA beside the mission
                    director who knew what to do. I wrote up the budgets for those years, I
                    negotiated agreements with the then Minister of Health (later Prime Minister),
                    the Minister of Education. We funded a number of things. I signed for the US
                    government believe it or not. Yes I did have a good deal to do with the senior
                    people.</p>
                <p>This was one of the things that upset Ambassador Ward because here I was, a Third
                    Secretary, doing all of these things.</p>
                <p>I also represented the mission twice at Mission Directors conferences because
                    Bill Hayes was off on leave. I went to Istanbul for a meeting with Governor
                    Harold Stassen who had then been named by Eisenhower to take over what became
                    the International Cooperation Administration. I represented the Afghan Mission
                    in Athens the following year, 1954.</p>
                <p>It was in the Stassen meeting that I first raised, first raised by any mission I
                    believe, the question of what U.S. might to do to counter what was the opening
                    of the Soviet aid efforts around the world. Afghanistan was their first real try
                    at putting on something besides subversion and military threats. They built
                    bakeries, silos and whatnots that everybody could see in Kabul.</p>
                <p>I raised the question first in Istanbul in December of 1953. It was considered
                    rather seriously whether or not we should try to compete with similar highly
                    visible projects. The answer was eventually-no. We would not in any way compete.
                    We would keep the level of our aid about where it was and do the things that we
                    thought were most necessary. And that was mostly the AID stance all during those
                    two plus years that I was in Kabul.</p>
                <p>It was a very interesting time. Kabul was a remote city. We had power for 6 hours
                    a day. Unpaved streets, one mile or so of paved streets, done by Morrison
                    Knudsen as a demonstration project. It took us 14 or 16 hours to drive up to
                    Kabul Peshawar, Pakistan, which was our only way in and out, including through
                    the Khyber Pass into Pakistan. And much more important to the defense of
                    Afghanistan, there was another pass the name inside Afghanistan, the Lataband.
                    You'd drive up through creek beds and lots of other things to get there.</p>
                <p>Later, this is jumping ahead in time, the U.S. built the highway between Pakistan
                    border and Kabul. It then took 4 hours, 3 and a half hours.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find dealing with the Afghan government? It
                        was tribal and all that.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>LEHFELDT: Actually the ministers at the time had been young men who'd been picked
                    prior to World War II for foreign training. Most of them were American educated.
                    The Minister of Education was American educated (Berkeley), the Minister of
                    Health was a doctor whose brother, Dr. Abdul Khayum (PhD, Chicago) lives here in
                    Maryland. He was vice president of Helmand Valley Authority, married an
                    American. Dr. Hakimi, deputy minister of Finance, another American wife. There
                    were a number of senior people of this sort who were either American educated or
                    British educated. So they were reasonably easy to deal with. They had to be
                    because I was not given any language training to speak of before I went there.
                    What I was given was a couple of hours of Tehrani Farsi not Dari Farsi. It was
                    mutually unintelligible in a way because Kabuli Farsi, Afghan Farsi of the day,
                    was I suppose akin to the relation of Quebecoise to modern French. There were a
                    lot of archaics and so on, a lot of mixture of Pushtu and Urdu in the Afghan
                    language.</p>
                <p>One of the things that I had to do when I was there was to set-up a staff house
                    for the AID mission, the TCA mission. So I rented a big house with 8 bedrooms, I
                    guess, and staffed it. Of course it had a mud roof. When it rained it leaked.
                    The roofs were held up with long wooden trees, poplar trees, lined and covered
                    mud and straw, and what-not on top. The wood extended right through the
                    chimneys, would catch fire and smoulder for days. Let's say it was an
                    experience.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your ambassador was one of the characters of the Foreign
                        Service, Angus Ward, who'd been a prisoner in Mukden, in isolated Mukden. By
                        the time he was Chinese before he came out, his language especially. What
                        was your impression. How did he operate? Any stories?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHFELDT: He was an unusual man, as you pointed out. When he arrived in Kabul he
                    drove up from Karachi with his International power wagon and his Cadillac.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And his cats?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHFELDT: And his cats, ashes of cats, and his wife, Irmgard. She was another one
                    of the genuine characters of the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Talk a little about her too.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHFELDT: I will a little bit.</p>
                <p>Ambassador Ward was a very correct gentleman. I learned a good deal from him as a
                    matter of fact. If you put aside his idiosyncrasies he had a lot to teach. He
                    taught me a lot about the niceties of the Foreign Service. How to really be a
                    diplomat, in a way.</p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>He had a lot of funny habits. I remember the first New Year's I was there. His
                    habit was to call on his junior officers early in the morning of New Year's day.
                    Nobody warned me about this. Our house-boy, Ghulam, came in to me at 8:00 on New
                    Year's day and said, “The Ambassador is here.”</p>
                <p>I said, “You've got to be kidding Ghulam. Go away, leave me alone.” So I didn't
                    actually get up and greet him. There was no way I could.</p>
                <p>He did this around the whole staff, to everybody's chagrin. The next year
                    however, everybody was prepared for it.</p>
                <p>If he had let us know—but that was not his style.</p>
                <p>He would get to the office early in the morning and work on his 6 or 7 language
                    dictionary because he spoke Persian and Russian and French and German and I
                    don't know what else. This was his life's love.</p>
                <p>His other love—because he had a red hot temper he would work it out by building
                    boxes, packing boxes. He would get the best cedar from the northern part of
                    Afghanistan and have it cleaned down to beautiful planks and build packing
                    boxes. So when he went home, actually when he retired they moved to Spain, he
                    had some absolutely gorgeous wood to use for whatever he wanted to use.</p>
                <p>One story about his temper—I wasn't along on this but Leon Poullada certainly
                    was, and Ozzie Day was, and a few others whom you may or may not know—but they
                    went off in his power wagon. They had 2 cars, both four-wheel drive, his
                    personal one and the embassy carryall. The Poulladas, and I've forgotten who
                    else were with them up in the Hazarajat which is in the middle of the country,
                    largely Mongolian in populace, mostly untouched by foreigners. Highways or roads
                    were nonexistent.</p>
                <p>They were driving along when they had a flat tire. They stopped to get out the
                    spare and change the tire. As Abdullah, his driver at the time, started
                    unpacking things, he unpacked slower and slower and slower because he had
                    realized he had not packed the spare tire. When it became clear to the
                    Ambassador what had happened, instead of saying anything he got a piece of wood
                    out along with a handful of nails and a hammer. He started hammering nails into
                    the wood, pulling them our, hammering them in, etc., just to control his
                    temper.</p>
                <p>The cats of course were another matter. They had several cats from China and from
                    Kenya where he'd been Consul General in Nairobi. He also had ashes of previous
                    cats on the mantle. There were stories, again I was not there, but the following
                    one is are true, I know because I know the people.</p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>They were sitting at lunch at the residence. The newly arrived Air Attach� was
                    guest of honor, and was sitting at Mrs. Ward's right. On of the Ward's cats came
                    up and started scratching him, really clawing at him and drawing blood. He was
                    flinching not wanting to say anything.</p>
                <p>Finally Mrs. Ward noticed his discomfort and said “Is the cat bothering you,
                    Colonel?”</p>
                <p>He said, “Well, yes frankly it is.”</p>
                <p>“Well, no wonder!” she responded, “You're in his seat!”</p>
                <p>They tried their best in many ways but they just didn't have the style to be nice
                    to the staff. They would invite whole embassy over for Thanksgiving. Of course
                    the Marines were young and hungry and unschooled. They piled to the front of the
                    line, causing Mrs. Ward to erupt. Mrs. Ward, early in the year, would buy
                    turkeys to fatten up but then when the time came, she couldn't bear to have them
                    killed. So we had turkeys from the bazaar which were strong and tough. You
                    couldn't make those turkeys tender any way, it was simply not possible.</p>
                <p>She insisted on some punctiliousness—gloves and hats, but she had some blind
                    spots. One such story involved the late Julie Byrd, Pratt Byrd's wife. When the
                    Wards arrived she, Julie, sent over a plate of cookies with a welcoming note.
                    They lived across the street from the residence. Mrs. Ward immediately sent them
                    back with a note saying, “We don't accept charity from our staff.” At which
                    Julie piled into her hat and gloves and went across the street and gave her a
                    lecture on American neighborliness. To her credit, Mrs. Ward took it to
                    heart.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: She was like many of the Foreign Service wives—Mrs.
                        Henderson and others—who really didn't understand, they came from a
                        different</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHFELDT: They did indeed. They'd never served it turned out, I didn't realize
                    it, but they never served in Washington. She had never lived in the United
                    States except in passing so she really didn't have an understanding of what
                    Americans were all about.</p>
                <p>When then-Vice President Nixon came through Kabul in 1953, of course there was a
                    large press contingent with him. The Wards gave a party for the American
                    community, such as it was—some teachers, AID technicians, the embassy and maybe
                    one or two businessmen, the Caterpillar representative perhaps if in town and so
                    on. So they held a dinner. Vice President and Mrs. Nixon were very gracious,
                    nice speech by Mr. Nixon, after which they retired. At this point Mrs. Ward
                    expected everybody else to leave.</p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>But not the newsmen, they were anxious to have a drink. They hadn't had very much
                    to go on, they were at the bar as often as they could be. Mrs. Ward was storming
                    up and down the hallways, muttering rather loudly “What are these people doing
                    here? Why don't they get out?”</p>
                <p>She really detested Mrs. Henderson too, she used to call her “that Hungarian
                    whore” or something to that effect.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Mrs. Henderson, was he at that time in Tehran?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHFELDT: He was in Tehran at that time. Mrs. Ward always felt that her husband
                    was not treated as well as he should have been.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think Mrs. Henderson was Estonian.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHFELDT: Something like that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: She had a tremendous temper too.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHFELDT: Old Ward for all his other idiosyncrasies, I think he did an adequate
                    job, more than an adequate job in Kabul. He was impressive physically. He could
                    speak Persian very well, he'd served in Tehran. He took credit for cleaning up
                    one of the remains of one of the ill-fated American financial missions to Iran
                    at the end of World War II. I think he really knew how to deal with them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So he had entree to the Afghan government.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHFELDT: He rarely ever was able to take anything to them that they wanted to
                    hear.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was just not on our list.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHFELDT: That's right. At any rate, it was a very enjoyable couple of years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just one last question on that, Bill. How did we view the
                        Soviets? I mean, at this time from the Kabul point of view, what were you
                        getting? Any emanations from your fellow officers or yourself?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>LEHFELDT: We used to go to the Soviet embassy for parties. They invited everybody
                    as did the Foreign Ministry and other embassies. The British embassy doctor was
                    our doctor and so on down the line. The Soviets were very suspicious and
                    couldn't get to know them very well because they were all locked in their
                    compounds. We only saw a few of them at official functions except for the
                    Ambassador who was a charming fellow.</p>
                <p>On the more mundane side, on the CIA side, every once in a while a defector would
                    come through that was handled through Kabul. That always gave Mr. Ward a little
                    bit of a heartburn.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That wasn't part of the old diplomacy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHFELDT: I was there when Stalin died. We didn't really know what we were going
                    to do in terms of Soviet-Afghan or Soviet-US relations but that was when the
                    Soviets started, really started doing their aid program.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any feeling about India and Pakistan at that
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHFELDT: Oh yes. The Pakistanis were always beastly to the Afghans. They would
                    close the border every once in a while to trade. Everything came through
                    Pakistan, came up through Karachi, Peshawar or through Quetta. There was no real
                    good connection between Iran and Afghanistan at the time; and certainly nothing
                    very easy from the Soviet Union into Afghanistan, except in the northern area.
                    We could buy Russian kerosene and gasoline in 5, 10, or 20, I forget in how many
                    liter tins.</p>
                <p>The Pakistanis could control Afghanistan through their border controls.
                    Occasionally the Afghans tried pushing for Pushtunistan which was their claim to
                    northwest frontier provinces. The British and the Pakistanis were widely
                    believed by the Afghans to be conspiring to keep Afghanistan in a state of
                    subjugation.</p>
                <p>The Indians were respected as were the Turks. The Turkish Ambassador, whose name
                    was Cemal Yesil, we used to call Kelly Green, was a real party boy, the Iraqis
                    were as well. The diplomatic community was close and small. Everybody was
                    included - especially secretaries because there weren't very many young ladies
                    around. So from a purely social point of view it was great fun.</p>
                <p>There was a lot of fun going through the bazaars trying to find leftovers from
                    Amanullah's days. One of my friends, who was the Assistant Air Attach�, bought a
                    couple of baccarat crystal chandeliers from old palaces. He still has one, his
                    ex-wife has another, they're gorgeous. You could buy Russian porcelain. It was
                    an interesting place to be.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left there in 1955, where'd you go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHFELDT: I was assigned to Bilbao, Spain.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where you served from 55 to 57.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHFELDT: Bilbao, of course, is the capital, a major city in the Basque country.
                    I was first sent there as vice consul to do consular work. I then took over the
                    economic reporting position that was there and eventually became principal
                    officer for the last year that I was there.</p>
                <p>I was still a bachelor so I had a different sort of life. As an official, I went
                    to all the official things but I also had a bachelor's life. I have still a lot
                    of friends in Bilbao.</p>
                <p>One of my major interests, and what the embassy really wanted me to look to, was
                    what was going on in the Basque community.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you talk a bit about your corner of Spain during
                        this 55 to 57 period because it's still a problem.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHFELDT: It was less of a problem in those days. This was well before the advent
                    of the ETA organization.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That Basque terrorist organization.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHFELDT: But Basque nationalism was rampant all over in the, what they
                    considered the four provinces that made up the Spanish Basque country. Vizcaya,
                    Guipuzcoa, Alava and Navarra. The Navarrese are a special kind of Basque. They
                    were Carlistas, believing in the royal line that descended through the
                    Bourbon-Parma line rather than the line that Don Juan and his son Juan Carlos I
                    reflect, although they were about equal in legitimacy of claim to throne.</p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>The Navarrese Basques were not necessarily Basque nationalists in one sense
                    because the Carlistas (major movers in the succession wars of the 19th century
                    in Spain) were a partner in the Falange with Franco from the beginning. The
                    Basque nationalist movement, was really started in its fullest form at the end
                    of the 19th century by Jose Antonio Aguirre, was what a number of the Spanish
                    Basques were pushing for. People like Marquis de McMahon, whose family name is
                    De la Sota, a very wealthy industrialist in the area exiled from the Franco
                    days. He had bought from Vanderbilt the Vanderbilt yacht and it was used and
                    evacuated in Dunkirk. I didn't realize until later that the house they were
                    living in Biarritz on the promontory was where the Commanding General of
                    Biarritz American University was living. It was a gorgeous place, I later
                    visited it many times.</p>
                <p>The Villallonga family, the Aguirres, the whole set of Basque families had lost a
                    great deal to the Franquistas at the end of the civil war. They were, during
                    World War II, very helpful to the allies in spiriting out, through France and
                    through Spain to Portugal, shot-down fliers or other escapees. Many Basques were
                    given medals by the allies during World War II.</p>
                <p>When the US and Spain signed our bases agreement, I think it was in 1952 or 1953,
                    many of the Basques became disenchanted with Americans. They turned their medals
                    back in. As time went on and we developed closer relations with Franco, they
                    became more and more anti-American, in a way because they felt that they had
                    been led down some kind of garden path. It all in a sense began with Wilson and
                    self-determination and all that sort of thing. It's true of a lot of minorities
                    around the world.</p>
                <p>So it was difficult for me to get to know a lot of Basques, partly because it was
                    difficult to learn Basque to begin with. I don't know it, I didn't know it. I
                    know some words, some of it at any rate, but not enough. But getting out into
                    the real Basque areas, the countryside, was a function of being friends with
                    somebody who could take you along with them and that's what I did.</p>
                <p>For instance, you may recall that during the civil war, a thousand or so Basque
                    children were taken to the Soviet Union by the Spanish Republican government.
                    The Basques for safety sake stayed there all during World War II. They were
                    treated very generously. They were university graduates and doctorates and all
                    sorts of things.</p>
                <p>In the time I was in Bilbao an arrangement was made between the Spanish
                    government and the Soviet government that would allow then mature people, twenty
                    years later, to return to the Basque country. I got to know some of them.</p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>There was a former Soviet General who was with the Voice of America, I can't
                    remember his name. He came to Bilbao and I took him around to talk to a number
                    of these people. It was a very interesting experience because he was interested
                    in knowing what was going on. But some of these, for instance one fellow, they
                    weren't allowed to bring in any money from the Soviet Union, or very little, but
                    they could bring in things. The Spanish government didn't want to admit that the
                    Soviet government had any kind of thing that was worth bringing, but one of them
                    brought a Zil limousine, he wanted to become a taxi driver. That really upset
                    the Spanish apple cart.</p>
                <p>There were 2 lady Ph.D. botanists. Of course they couldn't get a job, they were
                    sour apples. I know some of them ended up going back to the Soviet Union. For
                    some months after they arrived you could buy in the market big tins of caviar
                    and other things they had brought. But that was a sidebar.</p>
                <p>The Basque nationalists were always a little bit of a chore. One had to
                    sympathize with them for their aspirations but one really couldn't encourage
                    them in their aspirations. So it was always a little bit of a problem.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get involved in sheep herders and Senator Pat
                        McCarran?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHFELDT: I sent many alleged sheep herders to the United States. The PanAm and
                    the TWA representatives would stream into my consular district. They would
                    organize the lists and coach the guys as to what they were supposed to say.
                    There were damned few sheep herders left in Bilbao. Franco had planted all the
                    grazing areas with pine trees and eucalyptus for paper mills. So finding a real
                    sheep herder was not easy but we sent an awful lot of them over every year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They're in Nevada and California.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHFELDT: Nevada, California, Utah and Idaho.</p>
                <p>The head of the California range association, from Fresno, his name is John
                    Bidagaray, would come over with someone who was known on the Hill, a lobbyist,
                    as the Sheep Herder. I would go with them around every once in a while to
                    Pamplona and to Vittoria and so on. We really didn't have too much control over
                    it. It was controlled by the airlines and by the McCarran supporters.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Pat McCarran was the senator from Nevada, that was his

                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>LEHFELDT: Claim to fame for a while.</p>
                <p>We also had the Basque-Spanish orphans program. We sent a couple of orphans to
                    the United States, alleged orphans. They were no orphans, no question about
                    that. It wasn't that they didn't have family to take care of them. That was an
                    interesting time.</p>
                <p>I was also there during the Suez.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is October '56.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHFELDT: At that time I was on assignment detailed as vice consul, consul, in
                    Vigo. This was in the summertime, it wasn't as late as October, it was earlier
                    than that, July I think it was.</p>
                <p>The Spanish government customarily moved to La Coru�a, moved to Galicia, because
                    Franco would go on his summer cruise. He was a Galician after all. He would go
                    around to his hometown on his yacht. The Foreign Minister and the Prime Minister
                    would trail along on land.</p>
                <p>So when I was in Vigo was when Franco was traveling along and the Foreign
                    Minister was there. John Davis Lodge and Homer Byington were also trailing the
                    Foreign Minister because they had to present demarches of one sort or
                    another.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Lodge was the ambassador and Byington the DCM.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHFELDT: They had to present demarches to the Foreign Minister on the US
                    position on Suez and try to get Spanish support. So I spent a lot of time on the
                    road between the consulate and wherever it was they happened to be. One time
                    padding messages back and forth.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One time pad being a handwritten cryptography system which
                        was very time consuming.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHFELDT: Very time consuming and tedious. I was day and night for a week on
                    this. It was interesting and I remember once they were meeting in a little place
                    called La Ina. It was a resort on the coast, an island built by a soap
                    manufacturer, very nice.</p>
                <p>I had a message that I was instructed had to be delivered immediately to the
                    ambassador. So I walked into a meeting he was having with the Foreign Minister,
                    Fernando de Castiello, and handed it to him just at the time he needed it. It
                    was fortuitous, that was one of the interesting incidents.</p>

                        the embassy out of a consulate of Franco at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHFELDT: When I first went there, to Spain in '55, you had the feeling of
                    depression when you got into Spain, repression. It was true. Everybody was
                    careful what they said, what they did, how they disported themselves. Dress was
                    very conservative, ladies were mostly in black because if they weren't in
                    mourning for somebody immediate, they were in mourning for somebody close by.
                    Things were not freely available in the stores. The economy was not really
                    burgeoning at the time. The left over bitterness from the civil war and World
                    War II was still felt by many people.</p>
                <p>The repressions on the Basqueness, the Catalaness and the Andalucianess of people
                    were real. The Basque language was not permitted, you could not teach in it, you
                    couldn't have newspapers in it and so forth and so on. For instance, the bombing
                    of Guernica was still very real.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is during the civil war, a famous painting of

                <p>LEHFELDT: It's somewhere between Bilbao and San Sebastian (the summer capital,
                    eventually, when Franco stopped his yachting).</p>
                <p>I used to go to Guernica. One of the longest names of a man I've ever heard
                    anywhere in the world is a fellow by the name of Pedro Garaguerica Echevariettay
                    Sauregebeitia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You'll get a draft of this and you can spell it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHFELDT: There were people who had been there and were bombed, it was feria day,
                    a market day. Certainly it was true that Guernica had a special place in the
                    hearts of the Basques because that's where the kings of Spain would come to
                    swear to uphold what was known as the Fueros de Los Basques—the rights of the
                    Basques. And indeed King Juan Carlos has done that, he did it early in his
                    reign.</p>
                <p>So that Franco was viewed as a dictator, a repressor, an evil man. There were
                    always rumors that he was deathly ill, that he was going to die. Of course I
                    went back to Spain 20 years later and they were still rampant. They did not view
                    Franco as a savior.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the embassy? What was their viewpoint?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHFELDT: By that time US-Spanish relations were reasonably close. We had several
                    bases—Torrejon, Rota, the one in Zaragoza. So the official line was very much,
                    Franco was maybe not someone you'd want to have home for dinner, but at least we
                    were having relations with him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One last question on this. You mentioned Pamplona, did you
                        have problems with Americans getting caught running with the bulls?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHFELDT: I ran the bulls. No, never had any problems. I did it 2 years as a
                    matter of fact, it was great fun. Of course I wasn't one of those “bravos” who
                    would follow those bulls all the way from the beginning down to the end. I would
                    run in front of them and then jump on the doorstep or the windowsill of a friend
                    of mine on the correo. It was interesting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have consular problems? People trying to be Ernest
                        Hemingway?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHFELDT: No, I never really had any. In those days nobody got hurt. Somehow, I
                    don't know why, we didn't have the kind of problems in the early '50s that we
                    had later on in the '70s. People got used to the embassy and the consulates
                    being their savior.</p>
                <p>I remember though, one couple came to see me in Bilbao. It was shortly after I
                    got there. They wanted me to put a car and a driver at their disposal and take
                    them around the Basque country. Well, I declined the pleasure. They said, “But I
                    thought that was what you were here for, to help us make friends and see the
                    places.” A lot of people just didn't understand. As time went on they understood
                    better what we were there for.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They finally got you back to Washington.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHFELDT: No, I went first to Harvard.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You went to Harvard for what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHFELDT: Economic studies. I spent a very pleasant year there, with the likes of
                    John Kenneth Galbraith, Dusenberry. I took courses also at MIT, Boston
                    College.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this when Eugene Rostow...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHFELDT: Millikan and Rostow—that was very much in vogue, at least at MIT. Now
                    Galbraith and company didn't think much of it. My principal course there was the
                    Galbraith seminar he set up for Third country nationals. There were a lot of
                    eminent Pakistanis, Indians, Burmese and Indonesians. That was principally the
                    crew, one or two Israelis. But this led Galbraith to think later on, when he was
                    named ambassador to India, that because he knew all these senior guys in
                    Pakistan and in India, that he could sort of be ambassador to both places. He
                    learned quickly he couldn't.</p>
                <p>It was a fruitful seminar to be in. I learned a great deal about economic
                    development.</p>
                <p>After the year I did come to Washington. I was in South Asian Affairs first as
                    the Assistant India Desk Officer and the Ceylon India Nepal Desk Officer. I was
                    principally the Ceylon Desk Officer. One of my first duties was to debrief, if
                    you'll pardon that awful term, the Honorable Maxwell Gluck.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Explain what the Gluck problem was.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHFELDT: Mr. Gluck was a clothing purveyor, owned the Lucky stores among other
                    things, who was a great contributor to the Eisenhower campaign. He had been
                    named Ambassador to Ceylor. During his hearings when they asked what the name of
                    the Prime Minister was he said, “Well, I don't know. It's pretty long and I
                    can't quite remember it.” From then on it was downhill.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was a very famous case. All the papers had a wonderful
                        time playing with it. It was Basilnitro wasn't it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHFELDT: It was Solomon West Ridgeway Dias Bandaranaike.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Everybody learned that very quickly, those of us in the
                        trade.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHFELDT: At any rate, he was finally approved and went on out to Ceylon. When he
                    arrived he made friends with the Ceylonese. First when he got off the plane he
                    said to the newsmen, “My name is Gluck, it rhymes with pluck.” He was quite
                    popular all things considered. He was still a dress salesman, in a way.</p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>When he left or when he went, his wife apparently had a weight problem, it would
                    go up and down, took with her a number of different sizes of the same dress so
                    that she would be able to wear whatever it was. When he left they put on a sale
                    of all his stuff at the Mount Lavinia Hotel which was the best hotel in Colombo
                    at the time. He sold off all his stuff, the whole cupboard.</p>
                <p>Just as a postscript. His secretary, who was Georgia Tabularis, who'd been in
                    Kabul with us as a matter of fact, told us later that when Ambassador Gluck was
                    leaving Colombo he was carrying a package under his arm. He turned to her and
                    said, “Here Georgia.” Well, she thought, oh well a gift finally. He'd never
                    given her anything. “These are some dresses that my wife couldn't sell at the
                    sale, could you sell them for me and send me the money?”</p>
                <p>At any rate, he came back to Washington during my early days there. We had him
                    around and saw different people to talk about what was going on in Ceylon. He
                    was a pretty astute observer in many ways. Not everybody's idea of an ambassador
                    but for the times he was adequate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were our American interests? Ceylon was really your
                        bag.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHFELDT: For the first year or so our American interests were really not many.
                    The British still had a base in Trincomalee which they eventually gave up. That
                    was of interest to us but not crucial. We were interested in trying to make
                    sure—we were interested in everybody developing into a democracy.</p>
                <p>Mr. Dulles had special interest there because his grandparents are buried in
                    Jaffna. They were the authors of the first English-Tamil dictionary ever
                    written. It still exists. I'm not sure if we have a copy here but I know where
                    there is one. So when Mr. Dulles came to Colombo at one point, but I must say in
                    all of this, I've never been to Ceylon... I know Kandy, I know Nureylia, I know
                    all kinds of places but I've never been there.</p>
                <p>The Tamil Ceylonese strife was just beginning. Mr. Bandaranaike was the first
                    real Ceylonese nationalist. Our other concern in Sri Lanka was the communists.
                    We were concerned about communists worldwide. Because NM Perera was a
                    Trotskyite, we had a lot of funny things going on in Ceylon. Peter Kunan, who's
                    of Dutch descent, was the head of the communist party but they were very popular
                    in Ceylon.</p>
                <p>Everybody was afraid that one day we would wake up and find the communist enclave
                    right off the Indian coast. The Russians and everybody would be all around. It
                    never happened, and there never really was any danger, but we considered it a
                    real threat at the time.</p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>In some of the elections I know we spent quite a lot of money supporting one or
                    another of the United National Party candidates, the sort of Tories, hoping
                    against hope that Bandaranaike would lose. I've forgotten the name of the head
                    of the UNP, the United National Party. He was an old Brit. RSS Uwardna, who was
                    the ambassador here, was a very social animal.</p>
                <p>The Ceylonese are attractive people. They're lots of fun, well-educated,
                    well-meaning. If left I think without a lot of tension, the Tamils and the
                    Ceylonese would have gotten along very well, as indeed they did at least at the
                    upper levels.</p>
                <p>Understanding what made a country tick was difficult. We had a lady in INR by the
                    name of Rhea Blue. I don't know if you ever ran into her. She was an expert on
                    Buddhism. I had a lot to do with her because to understand what made Ceylon tick
                    at the local level, you had to understand the Indian caste system which was
                    overlaid and understand the Buddhist differences. Piled into all that was the
                    Brits and communism and the Trotskyites. It was sort of a microcosm of a lot of
                    funny relationships. None of them was a great moment to the United States.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you move at all into the Indian side?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHFELDT: I worked a good deal on the Indian side because there was a lot going
                    on in India in the mid-'50s. Nehru was still alive. He was a very important man
                    in many ways. We had important people as ambassadors there. The interest of the
                    administration was very high in what was going on in India.</p>
                <p>When Eisenhower left office and Kennedy came in, it became even more important.
                    Chester Bowles became Under Secretary and Galbraith went to India as ambassador.
                    The whole picture became more complicated in a way because the Kennedy
                    administration, at least at the outset, was expecting to make India it's first
                    showcase.</p>
                <p>The Indians are Indians, they wanted to do things their way, not our way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find sort of the subcontinent, particularly with
                        India, was having problems explaining to the principals, the State
                        Department and the White House, the realities of life. I mean the realities
                        of how India politics went, that you couldn't sweet talk them into things,
                        they had their own course.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHFELDT: They had their own course and they also had their own views of their
                    relationship with Pakistan especially. That was always at the crux of US
                    relations with both countries. Pakistan chose to be an ally and India chose to
                    be neutral. There are seeds for all kinds of conflict to begin with.</p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>While I think we were ambivalent about the Pakistanis in many ways, there was
                    never any question but they were members of CENTO and later the successor to
                    CENTO. Of course the Indians were having troubles assimilating their own
                    democracy, assimilating all the things they had inherited from the British
                    Raj.</p>
                <p>They had problems trying to get economic development going. We had thousands and
                    thousands of Americans active in India in “do-gooding” of one sort or
                    another—some of it effective, some of it not at all. The Ford Foundation
                    certainly made India its focal point for a number of years and spent millions
                    and millions of dollars.</p>
                <p>Somewhere along the line the Chinese got beastly up in Ladakh. That made us look
                    to India as a possible recipient of military assistance because they needed
                    helicopters for those very high areas.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this in your time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHFELDT: It was in my time, yes.</p>
                <p>By that time I had moved to the Afghan-Pakistan desk but we were all part of the
                    same office. So that became a further complicated problem. It seemed to me there
                    were some Indian elections going on. There was so much verbiage coming out of
                    India.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Kerala, or however you pronounce it, the communist strong
                        arm.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHFELDT: Kerala was out of Madras, the Consulate General.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Those were the hard core.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHFELDT: And of course things happening in Calcutta, Bombay. The efforts of
                    Morarji Desai to become Prime Minister. The Indian Defense Minister, Krishna
                    Menon, who was always a pain in everybody's behind.</p>
                <p>There was always something that was riling US-Indian relations. Somewhere in the
                    middle of all of this I was moved from Ceylon desk over to the Afghan desk,
                    which is where they wanted me in the first place, and the assistant Pakistan
                    desk officer. So I had moved from knowing the Indians well to knowing the
                    Pakistanis well. That was easier, the Pakistanis are a lot easier to know in
                    many ways than the Hindus, the Moslems maybe it's because of my Afghan.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think it's true. There's more affinity there because the
                        Indians tend to be very argumentative. They almost take the other side, they
                        talk too much. Also, they're very moralistic and there's nothing a
                        moralistic country such as ours hates more than someone who is more
                        moralistic.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHFELDT: I was for instance on the Pakistan desk when the Kennedys had their
                    first State Visit here. President Ayub was their first State Visitor. Our
                    relationship at that time with Pakistan was at a low. I wrote an awful lot of
                    ceremonial speeches, looked up an awful lot of things that the President and the
                    Secretary and what-not might use in their speeches.</p>
                <p>The Kennedys of course took the visit and made it a social triumph. They held the
                    State Dinner out in Mount Vernon outside. Mrs. Kennedy put on quite a show. All
                    of these speeches that I wrote, which were sort of questioning our relationship,
                    were turned around into very glowing full of promised things for the
                    Pakistanis.</p>
                <p>The only thing that I could identify, of the things I researched, was a quote
                    from a letter of George Washington talking about Mount Vernon. He said, “I would
                    rather be here in Mount Vernon amongst my friends than amidst all the crowned
                    heads of Europe.” He used that in his speech at the Mount Vernon State
                    Dinner.</p>
                <p>Well of course after Ayub left the hangover came. Relations were even more
                    difficult than they were because of the promises—that Kennedy treatment of Ayub
                    could never be sustained. This is what amateurs get you into sometimes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were at one of the focal points between
                        administrations when the Kennedy administration succeeded the Eisenhower.
                        Could you talk a little about the transition? Was it a difficult one?
                        Sometimes these are difficult, sometimes they're not but at your particular
                        area I would have thought it would have been interesting.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHFELDT: It was interesting, it was not difficult. You remember that
                    Inauguration Day, snow up to your elbows. Mr. Herter, who was Secretary at the
                    time for Eisenhower, was in his office saying goodbye to everybody.</p>
                <p>I was waiting around for someone from the Pakistani embassy to deliver a personal
                    note from Ayub to Eisenhower that I was to get and hand carry. Well, he never
                    got there, never showed. I was living in Foggy Bottom at the time, we had a
                    little house down there so it was easy for me to walk. So I walked out of the
                    Department to go home and there was Secretary Herter in his limousine stuck in
                    the traffic along with everybody else, still greeting people and having a drink.
                    He was a real gentleman.</p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>In terms of the transition, no, it wasn't difficult.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You weren't having some of the hard charging Kennedy
                        types...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHFELDT: We had those.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Running around like young Steven Smith and others, “Get
                        your old fogies out, we're going to change the world.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHFELDT: Yes we had some of those.</p>
                <p>One who later was named ambassador to Turkey but he was never confirmed. He was
                    meddling all the time during the Ayub visit. Everybody knew better how to treat
                    the Pakistanis than the Pakistan desk, naturally. And of course Mr. Bowles came
                    in, and Mr. Rusk.</p>
                <p>They assured us that we should go ahead making our recommendations based on what
                    we believed and on what we saw. They would make the political judgments. That's
                    essentially the way it came out. But of course world events don't allow things
                    to go on the way they planned them to begin with, that is what essentially
                    happened. The Chinese took a different stance. The Pakistanis were always doing
                    something different. The relations between East and West Pakistan were anything
                    but smooth.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While you were dealing with Pakistan did you wonder about
                        this division which is now Bangladesh? How long this thing could last?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHFELDT: One of the things that brought it home to me was the Deputy Chief of
                    Mission here, Kuaja Kaiser, was Bengali. He later, after he left Washington, was
                    named Ambassador, High Commissioner at that point, to Australia then to China.
                    He was Pakistani Ambassador to China when the two broke up. Kuaja with the help
                    of the Chinese maintained his ambassadorship until he could find a way to escape
                    without having to go back to Karachi. He then went back to Dacca where he became
                    Foreign Minister.</p>
                <p>You can always sense the difference in relationship between the Bengalis and the
                    West Pakistanis. Kuaja, whose wife died not too long ago, he's dead too, his
                    children are in the States. They're more American than anybody. He was more
                    comfortable with the Bengali embassy people than he was with the West
                    Pakistanis. That's not totally true but it seemed true to me.</p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>If you look into the relationship between the two it's clear that the East
                    Pakistanis were second class. It's militarily occupied and so on down the line.
                    The only reason they stayed together was because the military made them stay
                    together. Once the military was weakened sufficiently, then they split.</p>
                <p>We had people reporting on it. There weren't any doubts on anyone's mind that
                    this was an artificial arrangement and couldn't last. At least as I've been
                    told.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any feeling, because we don't like to see things
                        change, you say people were reporting on it, was there any feeling that our
                        principals didn't want to hear. I mean, “Don't talk about this place not
                        holding together.” I mean, could we say, “This is the way it looks.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHFELDT: You know I can't quite recall what the senior reaction to these things
                    was. I don't believe there was any real concern about the splitting up at the
                    time. It was later because I was in Tehran when it did split, so I have mixed
                    memories. We received a lot of the Bangladesh evacuees on their way home and
                    from Pakistan as well. So I have a mixture of impressions and I can't quite sort
                    them out right now.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is the 3rd of August 1994. Bill, you're now off to
                        Argentina where you served in Buenos Aires from '61 to '62, and Cordoba from
                        '62 to '64. What were you doing when you first arrived in Buenos Aires?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHFELDT: I was Petroleum Officer and Economic Officer and that was the time when
                    Arturo Frondizi had freed the oil exploration business. American and other
                    companies were permitted to do exploration. I got there just as Frondizi was
                    tossed out. So the next couple of years the oil business was caught up in
                    political turmoil because the nationalist parties, the Radicales del Pueblo, and
                    the conservatives particularly wanted to renationalize the oil business.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Frondizi stood where?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHFELDT: Frondizi was trying to open up Argentina to the world and to stabilize
                    the economy and to keep the Peronistas and the military at bay. He was tossed
                    out by the military and exiled to the island of San Martin, which is the way the
                    Argentines used to do things with their unwanted presidents. A military regime
                    was put into his place. I forgot who the General was who was running things
                    during those days but it was a general.</p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>So that first year in Buenos Aires was one of sort of trying to keep an eye on
                    things. I did manage to get around and visit the oil fields and Neuquen and the
                    southern area. It was very interesting because the Argentine oil fields are
                    small, spotty and require a good deal of attention and redrilling. They also
                    have high paraffin content so it's a high cost operation.</p>
                <p>About that time for a variety of reasons but partly to provide cover for CIA up
                    in the hinterlands, we decided, the United States, to open up a consulate in
                    C�rdoba which was a very important military and industrial center. Peron, when
                    he was industrializing the country, had put a great many industries there.
                    Automobile industry, Industrias Kaiser-Argentina, that was Kaiser car which
                    later joined with American Motors and Renault, the Italians, Fiat, did have
                    their own plant. Eventually, Ford came up there.</p>
                <p>It was also the home of the oldest university in Argentina and was,
                    traditionally, where most revolutions began.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is why the CIA wanted to get there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHFELDT: I'm not quite sure why the CIA wanted an office there but they did. I
                    wasn't their first choice to go and open it but the guy who they wanted to send
                    up, a political officer, he didn't want to go. So Rob McClintock, who was the
                    ambassador, asked if I would go. And willy-nilly, I went and opened the post. It
                    was a fascinating experience. I never thought I'd ever open a post in the
                    Service, even a small 3 or 4 man consulate, but I did.</p>
                <p>Cordoba turned out to be a very exciting place to be. We had several revolutions
                    while I was there. I got to know Arturo Umberto, Illia, he pronounced it Eelya
                    in those days, a little country doctor from Cruz del Eje, which was a railroad
                    town outside of Cordoba, who was elected President.</p>
                <p>I was the only one of the American mission in Argentina who knew him before he
                    became a viable national candidate for the Radicales del Pueblo. So I got Rob
                    McClintock up to meet him. He was about the only ambassador in Buenos Aires who
                    had known him before he became president. He was a nice old man, a good country
                    doctor. Not much of a president, he didn't last very long in any event.</p>
                <p>He brought in, as part of the baggage, this whole fervor to renationalize the oil
                    companies. So the Yacimientos Petroliferos Fiscales, which was the oil company,
                    don't ask me why that name was given total charge again. And a man whom I knew
                    quite well, Facundo Suarez, became the head of it. I left shortly after all of
                    them took office so I wasn't in on the denouement.</p>
                <p>The influence of the non-Porte�o people really became important in the...</p>

                </p>
                <p>LEHFELDT: La non portena, the non Buenos Aires. The party members became rather
                    important in the government but they couldn't keep the military under control.
                    That's where I left Argentina.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you talk a bit about Robert McClintock as
                        Ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHFELDT: He was someone whom I both liked and admired and found somewhat
                    difficult. If you'll pardon the term, he was one of my “rabbis” in the Foreign
                    Service. He took good care of me over the years as an inspector in other lives.
                    He was grateful for my wife's and my willingness to move up to Cordoba.</p>
                <p>He was a brilliant man in many, many ways. I've since learned that from someone
                    who took the trouble to go through a lot of files on people like McClintock to
                    see how they did on the entrance exams. McClintock had historically one of the
                    highest records on the entrance exams of anybody in the Service.</p>
                <p>He prided himself on his abilities to draft without substantial change, thereby
                    were some problems. He was a stylish man, he affected some things that upset
                    people, his dogs for instance.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: His poodles are well known.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHFELDT: But his intelligence was so overwhelmingly evident that no one really
                    could fault him too much for his personal idiosyncrasies.</p>
                <p>His wife, Elenita, was a lovely lady, Chilean-Dutch extraction, again with a lot
                    of style. The two of them made quite a splash in Argentina. He was good with the
                    Argentine government officials. He entertained them well.</p>
                <p>He had a good staff. Harry Conover, who was his Economic Counselor for a long
                    time. Ed Clark was his Political Counselor. Hank Hoyt was his first DCM followed
                    by Chuck Adair, again who was first rate. So he had a good embassy. He used it
                    well as far as I could tell.</p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did we feel about the...just trying to go back to this
                        period, this is the Kennedy period. Do we have any attitude, as an embassy
                        or among the officer staff, towards the military government in
                        Argentina?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHFELDT: The Alliance for Progress was of course one of the great hallmarks,
                    allegedly, of the Kennedy era. The Argentina government, in Frondizi days, gave
                    it a good deal of lip service and even afterwards they did. There was a lot of
                    hope among the Argentine populace that the Alliance for Progress would have a
                    positive effect, both on the economic life of the country as well as the
                    political.</p>
                <p>The Kennedy assassination, which happened when I was in Cordoba, dealt a severe
                    blow to the psyche of the average Argentine. Nearly as I can tell, just from
                    what I know about what happened afterwards, the Alliance for Progress just sort
                    of died on the vine, at least in Argentina. It got lip service under the Johnson
                    administration but it didn't lead to too much.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where were you when the generals pushed Frondizi on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHFELDT: I was in Buenos Aires at the time.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Not looking at it today but looking at it then, were you
                        or your colleagues sort of sitting around contemplating: Why is it that the
                        Argentineans, who seem to have probably the greatest blessing of any nation
                        on earth, in a way as far as riches and having an articulate population
                        without having to worry about indigenous Indians and all that, why can't
                        they get it together?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHFELDT: Several reasons, and we did talk about it a great deal, and I've talked
                    a lot about it since. They never really developed despite all the nationalistic
                    fervor that they could muster on a given moment. They never really developed a
                    true nationalism. A Brit grandson or a great-grandson of an original settler was
                    still a Brit, he would go “home” all the time.</p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>The Germans, a large number of whom came over both during the war and after World
                    War II, pretty much settled in obscure places for some probably good reasons.
                    The Italians were pretty much the worker class. The Italians have always been
                    flighty, a general proposition. The Spaniards who came again after Franco and
                    after the civil war, made up the first or second largest national group after
                    whatever passes for a native Argentine. There was a fourth group.</p>
                <p>The Brits had economic power. The Spaniards, to some degree, did as well because
                    they traced their bloodlines way back, many of them, and were proud of their
                    conquistadore past and so on. Surprisingly, the third largest group. If you went
                    into any town you would find a circulo Espanol, circulo Italiano and the Club
                    Liban�s.</p>
                <p>Los Turcos, they called them. The Syrians and the Lebanese made up a very
                    substantial part of the population. Many of them came over to the Cordoba
                    consulate district as wood cutters up in Santiago del Estero. The present
                    President, Menem, is a descendent of some of those folks. They were successful
                    entrepreneurial types. I got to know a lot of them very well.</p>
                <p>When we left Cordoba, they organized a group of cars and families up in Santiago
                    del Estero, which was a good 5 hours drive over not very good roads, to come
                    down and give me a real send-off. Good Argentines were also good Lebanese and
                    Syrians. Their Muslim past, some of them had, some of them were Christians.</p>
                <p>Anyway, the effect was, as far as I could tell, they kept their communal
                    differences without developing a real consensus of how Argentina should move
                    ahead. Of course the history of the last 65 years, beginning from about 1930
                    until recently, was the contention between the conservatives, that is the old
                    landowners, and old industrialists, they were in power until Peron took over in
                    1943 against those who wanted to displace them. That took its form in the
                    Peronista movement, the Descamisados and, of course, it took the most extreme
                    form.</p>
                <p>After World War II the contention between the successors of Peron, Peron himself,
                    his second wife was a source of a great deal of instability. The military was
                    really the only arbiter between the two.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where was Peron at that time? Was he in Spain?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHFELDT: 1960 he was in Spain.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we keeping a wary eye on Peron? Did we sort of feel
                        that he was bad news?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>LEHFELDT: He had intentions to come back which indeed he did. But at that time
                    nobody considered him a real threat. The Peronistas would win a lot of seats and
                    a lot of governorships in any open elections. Indeed the Peronistas did win in
                    Cordoba, the governorship, while I was there. Just about the time I left, that
                    was when Illia was elected president as well, they were a real political force
                    at the polling places.</p>
                <p>But still it was sort of the haves and the have-nots at each others' throats with
                    a military referee.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we basically, at that point, observers?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHFELDT: Well yes, but we were also trying to affect the economy with the
                    theory, I think partly the premised theory, that if you stabilize the economy
                    you can stabilize the politics. Also the Alliance for Progress approach to
                    things. We were also pushing for regionalism. We were hoping for a Latin
                    American free trade association. There was another little organization at the
                    bottom end of the continent between Uruguay, Paraguay, Argentina and Chile,
                    maybe Brazil, I've forgotten what it's called now. I haven't had too much to do
                    with Argentina recently.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm just trying to capture the attitude towards military
                        dictatorships back then.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHFELDT: We did business with them. The military, at that time, were careful to
                    keep a civilian in the seat. President Guido, who was president of the Senate,
                    was installed as president after Frondizi was displaced. It wasn't a general who
                    was actually president of Argentina, it was a civilian. So we had a fig leaf but
                    it was always clear that he was a creature of the military.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But also things hadn't turned really sour had they, at
                        that time? Did you have the disappearances and that sort of thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHFELDT: No that happened just after I left but the Tupamaros, which were part
                    of that movement, were beginning to become evident. It wasn't until after I left
                    that the desaparecidos and the Tupamaros and the death squads of the military
                    police and so forth occurred, so I can't really comment on that.</p>
                <p>The military themselves, of course, were split. They had the Rojos and the
                    Azules, the Blues and the Reds, that didn't mean any kind of communism. They
                    would have arguments amongst themselves.</p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>I remember at Cordoba, at one point, one day I went on down to the office and
                    Mariella (my wife), the Industrias Kaiser Women's Club, the American Women's
                    Club or something, were to go out to some estancia for a picnic. Mariella and
                    the two ladies from the consulate arrived there and nobody else was there.
                    Showed how informed I was because the Kaiser people had been told to stay home,
                    that something was going to happen that day. Nobody told me.</p>
                <p>Mariella and her friends drove between the gendarme school, the infantry school,
                    the artillery school, the air force school and that's where the fire was running
                    out. That night, of course, there was no electricity, but there were tracer
                    bullets and ack-ack and everything else going through the air and all over the
                    place. Nobody got hurt, eventually they settled it all.</p>
                <p>The Argentines weren't bloodthirsty. They became bloodthirsty later on, but at
                    that time there were certain rules that one followed in raising the flag of
                    revolt.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As an economic officer this is a question I try to put
                        from time to time, was there any great push for using American influence to
                        get American firms into the place?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHFELDT: There were a number of American firms already there: Westinghouse,
                    General Electric, Ford, Industria Kaiser. Those were jeeps. They were all there
                    in sizable presence. The drug companies were there. The American Chamber of
                    Commerce was a very important organization then in Buenos Aires. Not so much in
                    other areas but BA was, of course, the center of gravity. Half the population
                    was in the Buenos Aires area. That was, of course, another source of some
                    instability.</p>
                <p>Representing American firms was not a difficult thing because they were there in
                    presence and in large measure. American banks were there—Citibank, Bank of
                    Boston and so forth, Bank of America—were very important folk. The oil
                    companies, of course, were very important depending on what current policy the
                    government was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned, I try to document these, you were in
                        Cordoba when Kennedy was assassinated. How did this hit there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHFELDT: It was a real traumatic experience. In Cordoba they had the practice of
                    when something absolutely dire occurred, and it occurred once or twice in the
                    memory of man there, they sounded all the sirens and rang all the bells. When
                    the news of Kennedy's assassination finally arrived that happened. Everybody
                    stopped and wondered what the hell had happened because that really signaled a
                    serious occurrence.</p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>When the word got out, I was visited by the whole city council at the office that
                    afternoon. The Governor and all the military officers called on me and signed
                    the books and so forth. There were memorial service after memorial service after
                    memorial service all over. It was genuine as far as I could tell.</p>
                <p>It was a sort of trying time because the Argentines didn't know Johnson. They
                    didn't know what had caused the assassination. They were afraid it might trigger
                    something more drastic. But I think the genuine appeal of Kennedy as a person
                    was what triggered this outpouring of affection.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the issue of the Falklands or the
                        Maldives?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHFELDT: It was there and we knew about it and we knew it was a burr, but it was
                    not the most important thing in there. Every once in a while they would have
                    their turn knocking the Brits but nobody took it very seriously.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any sort of serious problems, at the time you
                        were there, that would affect us? Any political problems outside of the
                        internal ones?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHFELDT: No. The Argentines were not making waves in those days. They weren't
                    necessarily supporting us the way they do today for instance. I was amazed to
                    discover that the Argentines are going to authorize a force to join us in Haiti.
                    That would never have happened in our day.</p>
                <p>

                <p>LEHFELDT: They were not a factor.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LEHFELDT: This was early Castro days. Che Guevara was, at that point, was he in
                    Bolivia at that point? I don't think he had got down there yet. This was a
                    little before that became a heavy problem. But everybody was concerned about
                    Castro but it wasn't an immediate concern in Argentina in those early days.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>LEHFELDT: I came back to Personnel and was head of the Latin American personnel
                    assignments.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you talk a bit about Latin American personnel? I've
                        never served in Latin America. You know when I put the question to people
                        who've served in Washington, in the Department of State, I sometimes ask
                        them to rank the bureaus. ARA, the Latin American bureau, always ranks kind
                        of at the bottom, not because it's so awful but it's sort of off by itself,
                        and it seems almost incestuous. Maybe it's because they have these major
                        crises one after another or something to sharpen the thing. I don't know. Do
                        you have any feel about that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHFELDT: Latin America, you're quite right, was not the apple of every promising
                    young Foreign Service officer's eye. It was only with the advent of the Alliance
                    for Progress that it began to get some of the attention from first-rate
                    personnel, that it should have merited as our front step here in the United
                    States. But they added to their own problems.</p>
                <p>For instance, when Tom Mann was Assistant Secretary, he was Kennedy's Assistant
                    Secretary for ARA. Tom wanted to be sure that at any given time an American
                    businessman could walk into an American post and be greeted by someone, whether
                    he'd been there one day or 5 years, who (a) spoke the language fluently; (b)
                    knew the local milieu; (c) could be helpful to the guys. That was his real
                    desire. With the result that we became pretty much a closed corporation, people
                    couldn't get out, people couldn't get in.</p>
                <p>I remember Dean Hinton, when he was one of the stars of the European firmament,
                    wanted to get a Latin American assignment. One of my DASs Don Palmer, wanted me
                    to assign him somewhere. He was, at that point, an FSO-2, I think. I couldn't
                    get anybody to accept him. He didn't speak Spanish, not a great linguist in any
                    case. However good he was, they just weren't going to take a chance on him.</p>
                <p>Similarly, I was able to, with the help of the Soviet bureau, the Eastern
                    European crowd, able to get assigned from Latin America a few officers into
                    Russian language and area training. So that they could get to Moscow or to
                    satellite posts, get to know something about that then come back to Latin
                    America. Kempton Jenkins, for instance, there were one or two others.</p>
                <p>Those were unusual placements. By and large, when you are in Latin America you
                    stayed in Latin America. It was only when we got to the diversification of
                    assignments, at the junior officer level, that it became possible to really
                    interlard our various assignments.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have a problem getting junior officers to go to
                        Latin America?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>LEHFELDT: No, we didn't have a problem because at that point discipline was still
                    in place. They went where they were sent. If you know the panel system, we did
                    create a junior officer panel in those days, so that on their first assignments
                    they were able to sort of split the pie amongst the various bureaus. When we got
                    to them, their second assignments, it became more important what they themselves
                    wanted, and what their language abilities were, and how well they'd done
                    someplace else and so on.</p>
                <p>We contended rather freely. It was a complicated sort of thing but it was a
                    workable system.</p>
                <p>We had one of the major, during my two years in personnel, one of the major world
                    problems, at least for the United States. And that was the Dominican Republic
                    episode. At that point I had sort of carte blanche. We had two places to send
                    people—Vietnam and the Dominican Republic. For a while the Dominican Republic
                    took precedence over Vietnam, not long.</p>
                <p>We built up that post fairly well, very quickly, with good officers. Many of them
                    stayed in Latin America.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the women and minorities at that time, was it a
                        concern?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHFELDT: No, minorities weren't a concern. There weren't any, frankly. Women—we
                    had some successful women officers, some junior women officers. I assigned the
                    first lady DCM in the Service, Jean Wilkowski, whom I talked John Jova into
                    accepting as his DCM in Tegucigalpa. The first lady DCM in the history of the
                    Service. Even Jean didn't realize that until I told her a couple of years ago.
                    Maybe she didn't realize my role in that. I guess she knew she was the first
                    lady DCM.</p>
                <p>When ARA inherited the Caribbean countries, Eileen Donovan was the first
                    Ambassador to Barbados, eventually, she had been Consul General. But it took a
                    lot of doing on the State Department side to get the White House to back down. I
                    think they wanted to send a friend of the Democrats but I'm not sure.</p>
                <p>But no, it wasn't anything that concerned us and probably wrongly so, but it
                    didn't.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you left Personnel in '66 and went off to...</hi>
                </p>

                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>Now some of this was driven by the fact that I had a deaf boy to educate. I had
                    wanted to be assigned to London because the best school in the world, for the
                    oral system of deaf education, was at that time in London. That's the
                    lip-reading oral system. It was the Woodford School for Deaf Children, later
                    known as the Winston Churchill School.</p>
                <p>So I had, for instance, I had a couple of places. I could have gone to Africa as
                    a DCM, one of the ambassadors wanted me. But we couldn't manage to get a 4 and a
                    half year old boy from dark Africa to London to school all by himself. I
                    certainly couldn't afford to pay for it all, to pay for someone to go with
                    him.</p>
                <p>Indeed the whole question of handicapped children's education allowance was
                    totally inadequate at the time. I had to pay for a good deal of the early years
                    education, until we made a case to the Department—that away from post education
                    for handicapped children was somehow an obligation to be assumed by the
                    Department.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did this happen?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHFELDT: In the mid-'60s, '66 thereabouts.</p>
                <p>At any rate, Homer Byington, who was the consul general in Naples, needed a new
                    deputy principal officer. I had known Homer, he was DCM in Spain when I was
                    consul in Bilbao; he was on my board when I entered the Foreign Service; and he
                    knew something about me. While his wife, Jane, didn't know Mariella
                    particularly, he figured that I would be all right. The Department thought I
                    would be all right too because I could let him go on about his yachting and so
                    forth, and run the consulate. Keep the staff from him and him from the staff,
                    which is what my role was.</p>
                <p>Homer was a very conservative, hard-working bright guy in many ways. His wife was
                    certainly conservative, hard-nosed, very bright, a trained lawyer. They knew
                    Naples as no one could.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was born there, his father was born there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHFELDT: His grandfather was born there, his father was not. His grandfather
                    said that anybody who goes into the Foreign Service is nuts. His
                    great-grandfather had been assigned to Naples. He was a reporter at the Battle
                    of Gettysburg. He took charge of the telegraph office and locked everybody else
                    out, and sent the first word of the Norths' victory, I guess, or at least the
                    standoff. That they had the South to clean up at any rate, to the New York, I
                    forget which one it was, New York Post or one of them. He was later awarded,
                    assigned or given a post to Naples as sort of a lagniappe.</p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>Homer had run afoul of the Kennedys at the beginning of World War II. It's a
                    funny tale.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHFELDT: He was in the embassy at Belgrade. He was duty officer one weekend and
                    was down at the office. These two scruffy young men came wandering through and
                    the guard called Homer and said, “These two kids are here and they want to read
                    the classified reading file.”</p>
                <p>Homer went down and talked to them and said, “Hell, no.”</p>
                <p>They said, “Well, our father lets us do it all the time. I don't know why you
                    won't.”</p>
                <p>It turned out they were Joe and Jack Kennedy from London. At any rate, they never
                    forgot him. Joe died but Jack never forgot him. When Kennedy was elected, Homer
                    had been first ambassador to what was then Malaysia. He wasn't about to get
                    another ambassadorial post. So the old school network took care of him, assigned
                    him as consul general to Naples which didn't require Senate or White House
                    action. He stayed there happily from 1961 to about 1974.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you talk, I have to put in the record here, from '79
                        to '81 I was Consul General in Naples and everybody talked about Homer
                        Byington, not in particularly glowing terms. Could you talk about how they
                        are? He's now dead but one of the icon figures, almost a mythical figure in
                        the Foreign Service, particularly his connection with Naples. Could you
                        describe how he lived, some of the stories about him?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHFELDT: He was well connected. It was in the old aristocratic circles that he
                    was best connected. He could speak Neapolitan dialect better than almost many of
                    our employees in the consulate. So he entertained. They had the Villa Pavoncelli
                    to begin with, which was an old palazzo. Of course Mrs. Byington had lots of
                    money, they entertained well. I hesitate to use the word “royally” but they did
                    and they got along well with the Admirals and Generals of AFSOUTH.</p>
                <p>But the problems of keeping up an old villa, and getting the Department to
                    support it in the manner in which it was necessary, led them to eye the top two
                    floors of the consulate building. I presume that you lived there too. I was
                    there during that transformation. It was an experience. I think they created a
                    very nice representative set of digs for a good Consul General. It may not have
                    been good for somebody with a family, I don't know. It was not to everyone's
                    taste because his successor first covered up all the beautiful tiles. They were
                    treacherous out on the deck.</p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>He and Jane, like I say, knew all the old aristocracy well. Fred Reinhardt was
                    ambassador at the time in Rome, was an old friend of theirs. Doug MacArthur, in
                    Vienna, was an old friend. A lot of these folks would come back and forth. They
                    would go off on yacht trips together. He had his boat just across the way there.
                    He could keep up his own with the high-style admirals with their barges. In
                    terms of society, it was fine. He knew the Prefetto and the other people very
                    well, he entertained them well, they appeared to like him. I mean, you know,
                    what's there to report on particularly? And he didn't.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There really isn't anything. It's really one keeping up
                        appearances and also the passport, the visa business.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHFELDT: You didn't see what I did to that place, maybe someone told you about
                    it. They probably all retired by the time you got there.</p>
                <p>When I got there we had all the passport and citizenship records going back to
                    about 1875. An enormous file that took 5 people to manage. Of course by that
                    time all of those records should have been destroyed. I destroyed them and
                    cleared it all out. We went through them, of course, and rescued what needed to
                    be rescued. But the local employees were heartbroken when I did that because
                    that was their baby.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Also it requires intensive work, intensive. Jobs, of
                        course, the major function in Naples of anything was to create jobs. That's
                        what everything revolved about—jobs.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHFELDT: I don't know.</p>
                <p>Back to the Byingtons again. They were pillars of the Anglican church there, the
                    little chapel. I don't know if Father Willy was still there when you were there
                    or not.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I don't remember.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHFELDT: I became a, what do they call them, I forgot, it was a funny name,
                    largely at Homer's behest. They insisted before we even got there that we commit
                    to take a villa that had been in the hands of the consulate for several years. I
                    think it was finally given up to the French consul general, or the French
                    consulate.</p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>I had no real problem with the way Homer operated. He didn't bother me very much.
                    I had a good political officer usually. Peter de Vos was one such, Dave Engel
                    was another such. We had a decent commercial operation. The names escape me now.
                    The consular operation was well run by Margaret Fagan. Of course one of the guys
                    later ended up in jail, Steve Vitale. I had to fire our senior local employee at
                    one point, Corrado D'ambrosio.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Famous figure.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHFELDT: We caught him. We had a big health operation there, you know, the
                    examinations. We had a big maritime administration, coast guard operation there.
                    It was a big post for a consulate general. It's now down to practically
                    nothing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did Byington relate? I heard stories about how he
                        cleared everybody out who were living up in the consulate building and all
                        that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHFELDT: Nobody wanted to live there anyway. They were nice enough apartments.
                    Yes, he did clear them all out, no question about it. But in order to provide a
                    good representational set of quarters for the consul general, the Department was
                    persuaded.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think it made sense because, also, later in my era,
                        protection became a problem.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHFELDT: Security was a problem.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was secure.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>You know I gained the impression—I went to Naples as sort of an outsider. I'd
                    been consul general in Seoul, Korea. I came there, I was not a European hand,
                    particularly I was a Balkan hand, so I was kind of an outsider. I had the
                    feeling in Italy, particularly the political reporting, in those days anyway
                    there was no real change in anything. The same party was in power. Our embassy
                    in Rome would get very much involved in the minutiae of the political life which
                    didn't mean a thing as far as American policy was concerned.</p>
                <p>LEHFELDT: There was a periodic “crisi.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had a crisis, certainly more than one a year.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>LEHFELDT: I would go off around the consular district once in a while. Peter de
                    Vos went around with me once. We would stop in Catanzaro and in Consenza and in
                    all those great places and talk to the various political types. Put together
                    some local color and what was happening with the local parties. But it didn't
                    amount to a hill of beans.</p>
                <p>The major role of the consulate general, at that point, was maintaining relations
                    with the Sixth Fleet and AFSOUTH. To make sure that they were well treated and
                    so on. That's precisely what we did. We had a political adviser, as you know, I
                    don't know who was there in your day. Bob Gordon was the POLMIL guy in Rome, he
                    used to come down every once in a while. Phil Axelrod and Arnold Freshman and
                    Dan Brewster were the POLADs about the time that I was there.</p>
                <p>Everybody was busy with the exception of Homer and me. We were there to respond,
                    it was a pleasant place.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You went to Tehran. There you have an extensive oral
                        history, is that correct?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHFELDT: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can I get a copy of that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHFELDT: Yes, it's the Iran Project of the Columbia University Oral History
                    Project.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you have a copy by any chance? I can make a copy of
                        it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHFELDT: I think I have a transcript of that, I know I do. Let me dig it out and
                    make a copy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Actually, I'll refer to that, I think.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHFELDT: That pretty much covers my days in Tehran. Especially in the oil
                    negotiation days in the early part of the 1970s and up to the revolution,
                    including the revolution. As a matter of fact, I'd like to read that over and
                    see what I said.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'll put this in record then. We will stop at this point
                        because you retired after that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHFELDT: I retired and went back to Iran as a businessman, as vice president for
                    the region for General Electric Company. That's why I was there until the
                    revolution.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LEHFELDT: That covers that.</p>
