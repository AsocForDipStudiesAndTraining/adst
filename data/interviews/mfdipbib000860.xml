                <p>Interviewed by: Charles Stuart Kennedy</p>

                <p>[This interview was not completed due to the death of Mr. Newberry.]</p>
                <p>Q: This is an interview with Daniel O. Newberry. It is being done on behalf of
                    the Association for Diplomatic Studies and Training. I am Charles Stuart
                    Kennedy. Dan and I are old friends. This is the second interview that is being
                    done with Dan. The first interview was one of our early efforts and was rather
                    short, so we're going to do a more thorough interview this time.</p>
                <p>Dan, could we start off by giving me when and where you were born ansomething
                    about your parents and your family.</p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: That's very kind of you. Everybody likes to talk about himself and his
                    family. I was born in Atlanta, Georgia, in 1922. I was one of four sons
                    eventually born to my mother and father who, shall we say, had been Southerners
                    for from four to six generations on both sides of my family, going back to
                    colonial times.</p>
                <p>I grew up in Atlanta, Georgia, went through college at Emory University, and
                    never left my birth place until I went into the U.S. Army in 1943.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's go back a bit. What did your father do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: My father was a CPA, a certified public accountant. Q: What was your
                    mother's occupation?</p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: She had her hands full, raising four little boys.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you talk about your school experience? Where did you
                        go tgrammar school?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>NEWBERRY: Without going into my family's history, I might say that I went to
                    several grammar schools. We moved around in the Atlanta area several times, so I
                    went to two or three elementary schools. I went all the way through the same
                    junior and senior high school in Atlanta. So it was just the first part, the
                    elementary part, of my schooling which involved some change, all in the Atlanta
                    area.</p>
                <p>Q: What about Atlanta and the South as they were in the period prior to World War
                    II? What do you recall from this experience? In those days the South was really
                    a distinctive section of the country. The South no longer is so distinctive
                    today.</p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: No, Atlanta has been transformed, in some ways in a splendid way and in
                    some ways it has involved all of the “blight” of big, urban sprawl. Atlanta was
                    quite a different place when I was growing up there in the 1930s. Those were my
                    chief memories of my early childhood. I don't remember much about the 1920s,
                    because I was too young then.</p>
                <p>You were asking about the South and the “Southernness” of it. During my early
                    years Atlanta was indeed very Southern. One of my chief recollections and, in
                    some ways, one of my regrets, is that I was so saturated with the history of the
                    Civil War and the “glorious Confederate dead” that, when I left home, I said to
                    myself that I was never going to read another book about the Civil War!</p>
                <p>Since you've asked me and given me time before the microphone, I would like to
                    mention my junior high school. It was called Hoake Smith Junior High School. Mr.
                    Hoake Smith was prominent as a Senator or Member of Congress, I don't remember
                    which. Our Junior High School happened to be the closest school to the
                    Confederate Memorial Cemetery. Every year, for three years running, we were all
                    transported out on school buses to the Confederate Cemetery. We listened to
                    oratory like that on the Fourth of July elsewhere in the United States. Except
                    that July 4 is or was considered a “Yankee” holiday down there.</p>
                <p>Confederate Memorial Day [on April 25 each year] was the time when all of us
                    would go to the Confederate Cemetery. My chief memory of that time was an
                    awareness, after going to one of these events, that there were a lot of veterans
                    still living who had fought in the Civil War. A lot of them were brought to the
                    cemetery in wheelchairs, while others walked with canes. Many of them had long,
                    white hair. I remember saying to my little brother: “No wonder we lost the war!
                    There was just a bunch of old men on our side!”</p>
                <p>I tell that story because it brought home to me how much we were absorbed in the
                    Confederate cause, which we considered “our” cause when we were children.</p>
                <p>Q: What was the impression that you received as a young boy about Franklin Delano
                    Roosevelt, because this was the time when he was President?</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>NEWBERRY: I remember very vividly that my father was not an admirer of Franklin
                    D. Roosevelt. He was very conservative, politically. He was an adept or follower
                    of the great Georgia agrarian politician, Tom Watson. Watson's statue was on the
                    grounds of the State Capitol in Atlanta. So that was where my father's politics
                    came from. However, other members of my family and some of our neighbors
                    attended political rallies in honor of “Governor Roosevelt,” as they called him
                    during the 1932 campaign, when he came to Atlanta. All of us kids, and many of
                    the grownups, went out to see him, because everybody said that he was going to
                    be the next President. Everyone expected that to happen, even those who didn't
                    want him to be President. In Atlanta, GA, in 1932, we knew that we were looking
                    at the next President of the United States.</p>
                <p>Q: Was there any particular regard for Roosevelt because of his identification
                    with Warm Springs, GA? [Warm Springs had a naturally heated pool for the
                    treatment of people who suffered from what was then called “infantile paralysis”
                    or poliomyelitis.]</p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: We were all pretty much aware of the fact that he often came to Warm
                    Springs and to Georgia when he was President. However, this Presidential
                    election campaign all happened when I was 10 years old, so I don't have much of
                    a memory of it. My recollection of it came from listening to the radio when he
                    was nominated as Democratic candidate for President. I was that much interested
                    in it, even at age 10.</p>
                <p>Our reaction, that in my family circle, and among the people that we talked to
                    was not so much that Roosevelt was an “honorary Georgian.” At the time the
                    country was desperately in need of something. We were going through the depths
                    of the Depression, and people felt that we could not go on indefinitely with
                    Herbert Hoover as President. Even children understood that the Depression had to
                    be dealt with.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about race relations from your perspective as a young
                        boy athat time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: I have to respond to that with a heavy heart because, like all
                    “proper,” well-mannered Southern children, we were taught to address all grown
                    black men as “Uncle” and black women as “Auntie.” I thought, until I was already
                    out of high school, that I was paying respect to them in this way. More
                    generally, we called Blacks “Negroes” in those days, unless we were one of those
                    Neanderthals who had worse names for them. Then, one day, to get the attention
                    of a young Negro man, I addressed him as “Uncle.” He said: “I'm not your uncle.
                    I'm no relation to you.” That was a revelation to me that Black people, Negroes,
                    African Americans, or whatever you want to call them, did not like to have
                    little white children call them “Uncle” and “Auntie.” I tell you this as a
                    vignette of how little we understood what the Black people were thinking
                    about.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While you were in high school, did you develop any
                        interest in thworld beyond the United States?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: To the extent that any reasonably stimulated, alert student had such an
                    interest, we had an established curriculum. I studied history, geography, and
                    all of those things. I was very much interested in journalism. I thought that I
                    would pursue a career in journalism. So maybe, when I was a high school kid, I
                    read more about the world than my classmates did, simply because I was very much
                    aware of what was being carried in the newspapers. I imagined myself, some day,
                    writing articles for the newspapers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about diplomacy and the Foreign Service? Did you have
                        anknowledge of that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: No. However, I have to tell you, since you mentioned diplomacy, that
                    one of my forebears, and I think that it was my great grandfather's first
                    cousin, was a “political appointee” of a South Carolina politician. My forebear
                    was named Francis Pickens. He was sent to St. Petersburg as United States
                    Minister to Russia. Apparently, through Picken's third wife, who was much
                    younger than her husband, he was on very good terms with the Czar of Russia.
                    When their next baby was born, the Czar was godfather to this South Carolina
                    baby, who was born in St. Petersburg. I remember hearing of this very dimly. I
                    never made any particular point of it. It is interesting to note the family
                    connection, although it had no influence on my view of the world. I don't think
                    that any member of my family ever met Minister Pickens. This was the only link
                    that my family had with diplomacy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you graduated from high school in 1940?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: I'm sorry to say that I graduated from high school far earlier than I
                    should have. I graduated in 1938 at age 16. I'm sorry about this. I think that
                    everybody concerned with my early graduation used very bad judgment in letting
                    me move ahead in school that fast. I think that children should stick to their
                    own age group. At least, that is my own, personal view.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So where did you go then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: I went to Emory University.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which is in Atlanta.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>NEWBERRY: Yes. I used to take the streetcar to go to class. That was during the
                    Depression, and I really didn't have the alternative of going away to college,
                    although I did win a scholarship when I graduated from high school. However, in
                    view of the conditions of the scholarship, my father said: “That's hardly enough
                    money to pay the train fare back and forth!” So I never really considered going
                    away to college.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What courses did you take? Were you still thinking of
                        being journalist, or what were you studying in college?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: First of all, I had to work my way through college. I had to earn
                    enough money to pay my tuition. So a lot of my college curriculum depended on
                    when the courses were being offered and how to fit them into getting downtown
                    and doing my “moonlighting” job. Fortunately, Emory University, even in the
                    1930s, was very insistent on a broad, liberal education. Every undergraduate
                    freshman and sophomore had to take social studies, “hard” sciences, and
                    philosophy.</p>
                <p>So it was a great and wonderful way to study, especially for a young kid like me
                    who didn't know what he was going to concentrate on. I was really interested in
                    almost everything, and they offered a lot of everything. It was only in my third
                    year at Emory University, and for very practical reasons, that I opted to study
                    chemistry. So I studied organic chemistry.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You said that you were “moonlighting.” What were
                        yo“moonlighting” at?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: During my freshman year there were jobs available under what was called
                    the National Youth Administration. People in my circumstances were offered jobs,
                    usually on campus, so that they could make enough money to pay their tuition.
                    However, you had to put in about 20 hours or more per week. That's what I did
                    during my first year. Then I stumbled onto a job with the Rekordak Corporation,
                    a microfilm subsidiary of the Eastman Kodak Corporation. So during the next
                    three years, usually on my bicycle, I rode into downtown Atlanta and put in my
                    seven-hour day, processing tanks of Rekordak film. I'm not telling this because
                    I'm trying to “brag” about myself. I don't recommend doing this to anybody. It
                    was a very strenuous job. The biggest cost to me is that I didn't have many
                    friends at college. It's a tough way to go to college.</p>
                <p>Q: It's a very lonely way to go through college. However, the Depression was
                    probably the biggest influence on young people, certainly for several
                    generations, much more than wars and everything else.</p>
                <p>Regarding organic chemistry, what did you think that you were gointo do after you
                    graduated from Emory College?</p>

                <p>NEWBERRY: I didn't really know. At a certain point at Emory University, usually
                    at some point during your sophomore year, you had to choose a major course of
                    study. I didn't know what I wanted to do, so I began asking older people for
                    their views. This is beginning to sound like President Jimmy Carter and his
                    question: “Why not the best?” I asked people what department at Emory University
                    had the best reputation. Everybody said: “Chemistry.” I said to myself: “Since
                    you don't know, you might as well sign up for the department that has the best
                    reputation.” So that's what I did. However, I never worked in the field of
                    chemistry.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were at Emory University in 1941, when the United
                        Stateentered the war.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: Yes. I tried to get into things like the Navy's V-7 [officers'
                    training] program. In fact, at one point I had won an appointment to the U.S.
                    Naval Academy in Annapolis. However, they wouldn't let me into any of those
                    things because my eyesight was not strong enough, as was then required. Even to
                    this date, when I see a naval officer or someone in the Navy, wearing glasses, I
                    say to myself: “It's not fair! They wouldn't let me into the Navy!”</p>
                <p>Q: I remember that, during the early 1940s, I lived in Annapolis, Maryland, and
                    my father was a naval officer. I also had “weak” eyes. Eyesight was the
                    determining factor as to who was and who was not eligible to be a naval
                    officer.</p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: Well, in response to your earlier question, Stu, this was 1941 and we
                    were all “gripped by the war.” However, because of my defective eyesight, I
                    couldn't get into any of these military services. So I continued my program at
                    Emory University. Finally, at the beginning of 1943, I received one of these
                    notices from my Draft Board. I decided that I wasn't going to try to avoid
                    military service. I felt that if they wanted me now, I was going to serve. So I
                    entered the service just before the beginning of my last semester at Emory.</p>
                <p>Well, there were a lot of guys in my position. It was an all men's school, and
                    that's why I used the word, “guys.” A lot of us were in the same situation, so
                    the powers that be at Emory decided that anybody at Emory University who was
                    drafted during his last semester would receive his degree anyway. So I got my
                    bachelor's degree from Emory University “shy” one semester's credit. However,
                    they gave me a degree, anyway.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your military experience?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: I'm ready for that question because those of us who had anything to do
                    with the military services know how “haphazard” these things can be.</p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>Let me hark back for a moment. When I reported to the proper place at Ft.
                    McPherson, outside of Atlanta, GA, I took a streetcar. The Sergeant who
                    interviewed me looked at my CV [Curriculum Vitae] which I had filled out,
                    although they didn't call it that in those days. He said: “'Rekordak.' What is
                    that?” I said: “It's the microfilm subsidiary of the Eastman Kodak Corporation.”
                    He said: “Fine, you're a skilled photographer,” and he put me down as that. Just
                    like that! A skilled photographer. So, as of that moment, as far as the United
                    States Army was concerned, I was a skilled photographer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But essentially you had been processing film.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: Yes. This was a process of continuously stripping film, running it
                    through tanks, and mixing chemicals. I had nothing to do with taking pictures. I
                    was just developing the film. Anyway, that is an example of the “haphazard” part
                    of Army service.</p>
                <p>However, as I was listed with this “Military Occupation Specialty”...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: MOS.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: I put this altogether afterwards. But with a bunch of other guys who
                    were brought into the Army at the Atlanta Induction Center, we were picked and
                    “packed together” and put on a train going up to Fort Custer, Michigan. We only
                    found out on the train that we were going to something called a “Prisoner of War
                    Processing Company.” As events slowly unfolded, and I really have a point in
                    going through all of this, our “mission,” once we got through basic training,
                    was to go overseas and do all of this bureaucratic work of getting information
                    out of German and Italian Prisoners of War, in addition to providing the proper
                    information to the International Committee of the Red Cross [ICRC]. You would
                    think that, for a skilled photographer, this would provide him with something to
                    do.</p>
                <p>However, what the Army assigned me to do, under the Table of Organization, was to
                    run all of these ID [Identification Card] cameras and always with the same
                    focus. All we had to do was to put up names on these “mug shots” of the POWs.
                    That was the exacting demand put by the U.S. Army on this “skilled
                    photographer.”</p>
                <p>This really is leading to a point, because indirectly it led me to thinking about
                    the Foreign Service. As it happened, in the same year [1943] we were supposed to
                    be prepared to deal with Italian or German prisoners of war. We had
                    Italian-Americans in our unit who spoke fluent Italian.</p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>We also had Germans, mostly Jewish young men who somehow had been spirited out or
                    had escaped from Germany. They came over to the United States, just when they
                    were of draft age. They were inducted into the American Army. These guys were in
                    the barracks with me. I heard them all speaking German, and I decided that this
                    was my opportunity. I had studied German for one year at Emory University,
                    because in those days an organic chemistry student had to know enough German to
                    look up the references in a book.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, he would have to be able to do that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: So that was the beginning of my developing some fluency in German.
                    Again, in the United States Army they had a little “squeeze” [a
                    reclassification] just before we went to the Port of Embarkation [POE]. They
                    were filling out the TOE [Table of Organization and Equipment]. They needed to
                    have another interpreter. So they just arbitrarily informed me: “Newberry,
                    you're now an interpreter.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: That's the way, or used to be the way, that things were done in the
                    Army. I hope that it's better organized now, although I really don't know how it
                    is done. I had a particular story to tell you...</p>
                <p>Q: No, I'd like to “capture” your military experience, because I think that it's
                    very important for anyone to understand who these people are who have played a
                    role in the formulation and implementation of American foreign policy. How did
                    this work out? Where did you go overseas, and what were you doing?</p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: We had several “false starts.” This is interesting in terms of the way
                    the war unfolded. We went through basic training and then were waiting for the
                    call to go to our Port of Embarkation. Suddenly, the bulk of the German Afrika
                    Korps collapsed in North Africa [in May, 1943], and shiploads of German POWs
                    were being sent to the United States from Tunisia and other places where they
                    had surrendered or been captured. So we had to deal with them, get them
                    distributed, and quickly organize POW camps in the United States. We did that
                    for several months before we could even think about going overseas.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did it work for you as an interpreter? Were you
                        interpretinat that point?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>NEWBERRY: Actually, I was “translating,” because that's what I was doing with the
                    POWs who came in my “queue” [waiting line], as in a visa office. I had several
                    questions that I could ask these German POWs. By then I knew enough German to
                    understand their answers to questions such as: “Where were you captured? Who
                    captured you?” Then there were the standard questions such as: “Who is your next
                    of kin?” and so on. It was a pretty standard series of questions.</p>
                <p>We had been briefed enough to know that there were certain kinds of prisoners
                    whom we should turn over to S-2 or G-2 [basic unit or higher unit intelligence
                    entity]. Presumably, these prisoners had been “screened” on the battlefield.
                    However, some of them were still of intelligence interest, and we would alert
                    other people to deal with them. We were not ourselves intelligence personnel.
                    Actually, we served under the Corps of Military Police.</p>
                <p>Unfortunately, most of us were ashamed that we had to wear the “crossed pistols”
                    [insignia of the Military Police] on our uniforms. Everybody thought that we
                    were MPs. We weren't, in fact.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did you go overseas?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: We went overseas in April, 1944. The Army was still setting up various
                    POW enclosures in places in England, in anticipation of the invasion of
                    Normandy. So we spent a lot of time moving around England in April-June, 1944.
                    Eventually, we went across to France on something like D+15, early in July,
                    1944, I guess.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing there? The same thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: We spent an awful lot of time in a kind of “holding pattern” because we
                    didn't have any prisoners of war to process, of course, until after we arrived
                    in France after D-Day [June 6, 1944]. We were limited to working with the local
                    British Military Police, who had control of prisoners of war. The British
                    Military Police tended to assign us to preparations to set up enclosures for
                    POWs who would be captured by the American Army. It was going to be our
                    responsibility to put these German POWs into these enclosures, then get them
                    out, and, presumably, moved to the United States. However, this latter duty was
                    not part of our mission. We were simply organizing to receive German POWs and
                    “disposing of them,” that is, moving them on.</p>
                <p>In fact, the American Army started sending German POWs over to England before we
                    crossed the English Channel on our way to France. So we were slightly delayed in
                    setting up POW enclosures in France.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the war progress for you, after you crossed over
                        to France?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: It was really not as dramatic as it may sound. It may sound rather
                    “thrilling” in retrospect, but my unit was on the first plane to land at the
                    airstrip in Cherbourg which had been reconditioned following the invasion and
                    the subsequent capture of Cherbourg. By that time the “front” had already moved
                    perhaps 30 or 40 miles South of Cherbourg, so we were not in any particular
                    danger. However, we were required to dig “foxholes” [individual trenches]. This
                    gave me my first experience of sleeping in a foxhole. I missed out on the only
                    air raid that I ever went through, because I was asleep in the foxhole and
                    couldn't hear what was going on. So that was the only kind of real war
                    experience that I ever had.</p>
                <p>We were never actually in the combat zone. We were in what they called an
                    “advance sector” or “adsec,” as the Army called it. We were never in the front
                    line, except that during the “Battle of the Bulge” [December, 1944, to January,
                    1945] the front line came fairly close to where we were bivouacked. We didn't
                    know quite how close we were to the front line. We weren't supposed to be in the
                    actual combat zone.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What happened when German resistance collapsed at the end
                        oApril, 1945?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: In terms of our own experience, the most immediate consequence was
                    that, when the Wehrmacht [German Army] collapsed, there were still pockets of
                    resistance in Western France, such as St. Nazaire, Lorient, and Brest, where
                    German submarine pens were located. We had to go and process all of those people
                    after the surrender. They had been “holed up” in those positions for some
                    months. We had to “dispose of them,” too.</p>
                <p>Then, at that point, the Army began breaking up our unit. I was assigned to
                    another unit in Brussels, working on “redeployment.” Then, at a sort of “magical
                    moment,” after V-E Day [May 7, 1945] I was assigned to a much more interesting
                    job in a Military Government unit in Bavaria. At this point we're getting away
                    from the story of my Prisoner of War unit, which I want to return to, because
                    there is one particular incident that I wish to discuss. My last six months in
                    the Army, up to late 1945 or early 1946, was in a specialized unit.</p>
                <p>We were supposed to find “non-Nazi” German newspapermen to get “democratic”
                    newspapers started up. They were not very easy to find, because of the nature of
                    the Nazi regime. Anybody who wanted to get a job on a newspaper had to belong to
                    the “Deutsche Presse Kammer,” a subsidiary organization of the Nazi Party. So
                    anybody who had a “Presse Kammer” card was automatically ineligible to be the
                    editor of a newspaper, because he was considered a former Nazi. This was sort of
                    a “Catch 22” situation, but eventually we found some newspapermen. Some of the
                    newspapers that we worked with, such as the “Neue Deutsche Zeitung,” the
                    “Regensberger Neue Presse,” and so forth.</p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>Anyway, there were three or four papers for which I helped to find working
                    journalists and which were still being published at the end of the war. They are
                    still being published some 40 years later. I am proud of my “tiny” role in
                    getting a democratic press started in Germany, back in 1945 and 1946. A very
                    minor role, I must say. Remember, at that time I was a Sergeant, so I didn't
                    have much authority.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned that there was something which you wanted
                        tmention, when you were with the Prisoner of War Processing Group.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: In a certain sense, it's a little repetitious, because a little
                    vignette from this experience appeared in a magazine article on the occasion of
                    the 50th anniversary of the end of World War II, which appeared in the fall of
                    1995. There were lots of little “memoirs,” including comments by Foreign Service
                    officers, in that article. Unfortunately, my contribution to this article was
                    considerably reduced in length when it was published. The proper citation for
                    this article, I think, is the September, 1995, issue of the “Foreign Service
                    Journal.” Everything in this issue looked back on the events of World War
                    II.</p>
                <p>However, what I am about to mention was even more limited than that. As I
                    mentioned, we started to get German POWs in England in 1944 before we crossed
                    the English Channel into France. The very first batch of German POWs assigned to
                    us just appeared in the middle of the night and without any warning.</p>
                <p>We were billeted in a disused cotton mill somewhere in Lancashire. It was a
                    “wretched” place if there ever was one, in terms of the physical facilities. I
                    say “disused.” It had not been abandoned. During World War II the British used
                    every available space, so this facility was not “abandoned.” It was simply a
                    “disused” cotton mill.</p>
                <p>For some reason or another some of our officers, including my own platoon
                    commander, was away, maybe on leave, or something like that. All of a sudden we
                    received a trainload of what we were told were “prisoners of war.” However, they
                    were not really “prisoners of war.” They were “slave laborers” who had been
                    liberated from Nazi control. These were people who had been sent out to Western
                    France to build the so- called “Atlantic Wall” fortifications on the Atlantic
                    coast of France. As it turned out, they included Russians and people from
                    Central Asia from all sorts and conditions of wretched humanity who had been
                    piled into railroad boxcars and sent to build the Atlantic Wall in France.</p>
                <p>It turned out that they were the first people to come to us for processing. We
                    didn't have a commissioned officer around. So as the senior non-commissioned
                    officer, I looked out at this “sea” of people in front of me. They had been
                    trained by the Germans to march in formations 24 people abreast. They came into
                    this huge, empty space in the disused cotton mill to which we had been
                    assigned.</p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>Nobody was in charge of them. I mention this to give you a sense of the trauma
                    involved. I was wondering what in the world we were going to do with them.
                    Something told me to get out there in the middle of the room and shout:
                    “Abteilung, Halt!” [Detachment, halt!]. They understood this much German and
                    they all stopped. Then I gave the command “At ease” in German. When we finished
                    counting them, we wondered what we were going to do with these people.</p>
                <p>However, we found among these people a Russian, a Captain in the Red Army, who
                    could speak German. We organized a “relay” of interpreters. I spoke German to
                    this Russian officer. This Captain would speak in Russian to various people in
                    this group, which included Tatars, Uzbeks, and people from Soviet Georgia. We
                    had to go through a questionnaire prepared by the ICRC, the International
                    Committee of the Red Cross [in Switzerland]. I reached the point where I could
                    hear the questions moving along this “relay” from one language to another, even
                    though I didn't understand the languages involved. Then, I had to wait for this
                    “relay” until I could hear the answer in German. After this I would then type
                    the answer in English on the ICRC form.</p>
                <p>Of course, I had never seen people that even remotely looked like these people
                    out of Central Asia. I'll mention two of them in particular. This was when my
                    mind “opened up” to the possibility of making a career out of dealing with
                    people whose background was different from mine. This was a cloud no bigger than
                    my finger, but I think that, after this experience, I became aware of an
                    interest in making a career outside of the United States.</p>
                <p>I would like to mention two particular episodes in this chain of “relays.” One
                    episode, and I described it in this little article in the “Foreign Service
                    Journal,” involved a very young-looking prisoner or, perhaps more properly, a
                    liberated slave laborer. In this “relay” of questions I found that this boy was
                    17 years old. He was a shepherd from the northwestern part of Uzbekistan. More
                    precisely, he was from the “Soviet Socialist Republic of Uzbekistan.” He had
                    been taking care of a herd of his uncle's Karakul sheep up in the northwestern
                    part of Uzbekistan.</p>
                <p>One day he had the bad luck to walk down to the local village on a trip he made
                    semi-annually into the village to buy supplies. After buying the supplies he
                    intended to return to his herd. It turned out that a Red Army conscription team
                    was in the town on the day when he had the misfortune to go into it to buy
                    supplies. Of course, they conscripted him into the Red Army. They put him on a
                    train and sent him to the front, with no training. He was almost immediately
                    captured by the Germans and sent out to work on the construction of the Atlantic
                    Wall in France. I figured that from the time he turned his sheep over to his
                    uncle to go into town, until I was sitting there, asking him these questions, a
                    total of six weeks had elapsed!</p>
                <p>Even today I try to imagine what was in that poor boy's mind. In six weeks he
                    went through this experience, ending up talking to Americans in this funny
                    ex-cotton mill in Lancashire! You can imagine what this did to my
                    imagination.</p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>A word about the physical setting for this contact with the slave laborers. There
                    were several “aisles,” because those of my colleagues who spoke German were
                    doing the same sort of thing. Our company clerk, who really didn't know much
                    German, was curious about this process. He came up to me and said: “Sergeant
                    Newberry, do you see that man over there in the corner?” The man had a bandanna
                    tied up around his head. He looked swarthy and appeared to be something like a
                    gypsy fortune-teller. The company clerk, who was an American Jew from the Bronx
                    [borough of New York], said: “Newberry, I think that that man is a Jew.” I said:
                    “No way! How could a Jew survive all of this?”</p>
                <p>We arranged to have this man taken aside and decided to pursue this matter. When
                    we had caught up with our other work, a couple of us took him to the side of the
                    office. My friend, the company clerk, came out with a question in Yiddish: “Are
                    you a Jew?” The man looked startled. You could tell, from his manner, that he
                    had some sense of what was being asked, because this was something that Oriental
                    Jews had probably heard. After patient questioning we found out that he was
                    indeed a Jewish silversmith from Tbilisi [also known as Tiflis]. He had been
                    caught up in all of this, and his fellow Georgians never let on to the Germans
                    that they had a Jew in that group. This was one of the most marvelous stories I
                    can recall!</p>
                <p>Anyway, those are two incidents that stand out in my mind from that middle of the
                    night experience in the cotton mill in Lancashire. This experience opened my
                    mind, and I realize now, in retrospect, that that's what got me to thinking
                    about the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>Q: I think that, for so many of us, the military experience of our generation was
                    often the catalyst that led us into deciding to enter the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: Stu, I have another comment, though it is not directly related to what
                    I have just mentioned. This was another one of those “incidental” benefits of
                    being in a military unit that did not have to spend all of its time trying to
                    stay alive and keeping body and soul together. A lot of the time I spent in my
                    unit was the classical, military practice of “hurry up and wait.” However, this
                    is one of the things that I wish that somebody would look into. This is sort of
                    an intellectual “GI Bill” [U.S. government benefits for veterans of World War II
                    military service] in advance. During World War II there was the USO [United
                    Services Organization]. The USO people, in collaboration with experts, set up a
                    shelf list of titles of good books for soldiers, sailors, and airmen to read.
                    Every military unit was supposed to have a complete collection of these
                    paperback books.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They were small and long.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>NEWBERRY: Yes. They were all the same, standard size. I remember that in my unit
                    we had a guy who could make anything. He made a special case for these books so
                    that we could bring them along with us. We brought the books with us. In our
                    collection I think that there were about 200 books. I think that I read every
                    one of them. I've often thought of the many guys in my circumstances who had
                    considerable, intellectual curiosity. However, if we hadn't had those books, we
                    would have been bored to death. I will pay tribute to the opportunity that those
                    books gave me. When I took the Foreign Service exam, in the section on general
                    information, I even startled myself at the high grade that I received. I
                    attribute this to the fact that I had the opportunity, as a soldier, to read
                    about everything in this collection of books. That was one of the curious,
                    unintended benefits of being in an essentially “non-combat” unit, with time on
                    my hands but with books to read.</p>
                <p>Q: This is one of the things about military service. I discovered, when I was in
                    the Army, that I read a lot of things which I never would have read if I'd had a
                    more complete selection of books. However, we had only a limited selection of
                    reading material, so we were reading much better than we would have done if we
                    had been allowed to read books that are the equivalent of “chewing gum for the
                    mind.”</p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: Or the equivalent of airport, “newsstand” books.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. Well, then, you mentioned that in 1946 you were
                        dischargefrom the Army.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: Yes. I was “re-deployed,” which was the word used, back to the U.S. on
                    a troopship. As soon as I got back to the U.S., in this case to Fort Dix, New
                    Jersey, I was discharged from the service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So this was in 1946. What happened then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: I had a perhaps naive notion that I knew that I had a somewhat
                    “discounted” degree from Emory University. I had a bachelor's degree but I
                    hadn't had a full, four years of academic credits. So I used my time under the
                    GI Bill to go back to college and take some courses at the undergraduate level,
                    just so that I could face the world and say: “Yes, I have an undergraduate
                    degree from Emory University and I have all of the credits that go with it.”
                    This was really a period when I was deciding what to do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you “kicking around” in your mind while you
                        werdeciding this?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>NEWBERRY: I knew that I wanted to see more of the world. I didn't quite know how
                    to go about doing this. There were all sorts of circumstances that applied to
                    this process. I didn't have many adult “mentors” [persons from whom to seek
                    advice]. I won't go into that in detail but I was sort of groping.</p>
                <p>One day I happened to meet a man who had been about two or three years ahead of
                    me at Emory University. He had just passed the Foreign Service exam. He
                    explained how difficult he thought it had been. On an impulse I said: “I'll bet
                    I can pass it!” He told me how to write off and get a copy of a sample Foreign
                    Service examination and so forth. When I received a copy of the sample
                    examination and saw what the exam was about, I realized that passing this exam
                    was not going to be a “breeze.”</p>
                <p>Either somebody had told me or I realized this from the literature I had on hand
                    that to pass the exam, there was no escaping having a good background in
                    American history. Simply speaking, the exam was designed in such a way that you
                    could not “sneak past” American history. So during the next several months I
                    must have read at least 20 or so books on American history. First of all, it was
                    a matter of pride. I wanted to pass the Foreign Service exam. Also, I became
                    interested in what I was reading. In the end, the answer obviously is that I
                    succeeded in passing this exam.</p>
                <p>I took the Foreign Service exam in 1947 and passed it. The examination may be
                    even worse now, but in 1947-1949 the Department of State was only appointing a
                    couple of dozen new FSOs [Foreign Service officers] every year. So there was a
                    big backlog of people who had passed the written and oral exam and were awaiting
                    appointment. The personnel people in the State Department told me in 1948, when
                    I passed the oral exam, that it was going to be a long wait before I could
                    expect appointment as an FSO. They told me: “Mr. Newberry, congratulations on
                    your having passed the written and oral exams. However, you'd better think about
                    doing something else for a year or two because there are a lot of people in the
                    queue ahead of you.”</p>
                <p>This was the one time when I had parlayed my education in chemistry into getting
                    a job. I got a job as a “detail salesman” for E. R. Squibb, the pharmaceutical
                    company. That's what I was doing when my invitation to join the Foreign Service
                    finally came through.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could we talk a bit about what you can remember of the
                        oraexamination? Do you remember any questions or how it was conducted?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>NEWBERRY: When you asked that question, it reminded me of... I don't know who it
                    was who said that there is nothing like being sentenced to execution to
                    concentrate your mind. Naturally, I was very much concentrated on the prospect
                    of appearing before an oral, examination panel. I have a fairly good memory of
                    it, although it took place about 50 years ago, in 1948.</p>
                <p>The oral panel consisted of a rather disparate group of people. I think that
                    there were five members. Anybody who has done research on the history of the
                    Foreign Service during this period will have run across the name of Joseph
                    Green, a career Foreign Service officer. At the time of which I speak, he
                    presided over all of the oral examination panels. Another member of my oral
                    examination panel was a retired Westinghouse Corporation executive. There were
                    also a couple of “public” members. Former Ambassador Jack Jernegan, whom I later
                    worked for, was also on the panel. He was an old NEA [Bureau of Near Eastern
                    Affairs] type. He was eventually ambassador to a North African country, perhaps
                    Algeria, [and later to Israel].</p>
                <p>I was much struck by how different their approaches to me were. I thought that
                    the Chairman, Joseph Green, was very “difficult.” For example, he said: “How is
                    it that with all of the experience you had you only barely passed the German
                    language examination?” I said: “I only had a year of formal, German language
                    instruction in college. Most of my experience with German was sort of 'picked
                    up.' I was satisfied with my grade.” Then one of the other examiners picked up
                    on this point and said: “Mr. Newberry, why is it that you don't have more of a
                    'Southern' accent?” That surprised me, but I dealt with that. They were very
                    much interested in my Georgia accent, and very rightly so. I sense that what
                    they were after was to make sure that this candidate, in this case me, really
                    had his roots in the United States. That was the approach that they took, and it
                    was not a bad one.</p>
                <p>They asked me a number of questions. Since you give me the opportunity, I'll
                    mention one of them. The examiners were all people who “kept up” with the news.
                    There was one unusual episode in Georgia history. If you will think back, you
                    may remember it. At one time we had three Governors of Georgia at the same

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this Eugene Talmadge and...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: Talmadge and Carmichael, and I don't remember the name of the other
                    Governor. However, it was a very complicated situation, and I explained it. They
                    said: “Imagine that you're explaining this to a foreigner how this could
                    happen.” So I said that my family was on the Gene Talmadge side of the
                    controversy and that I had followed all of this, although from some
                    distance.</p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>This situation involved three claimants to the office of Governor of Georgia.
                    Gene Talmadge was a veteran politician in Georgia who had previously been
                    elected Governor of the state. He was making a “comeback” at this time.
                    Unbeknownst to the general public, even when he was running for reelection, he
                    was suffering from cancer. His family knew that he was not going to live much
                    longer. They hoped that he would last long enough to win the election and be
                    inaugurated for another term as Governor. However, and for the first time in the
                    history of Georgia, a candidate for Lieutenant Governor was also on the ballot
                    and was running for reelection. This man, who had been the first, elected
                    Lieutenant Governor, was not from Talmadge's political party. The Talmadge
                    supporters in the Georgia State Legislature had quietly arranged to have Herman
                    Talmadge, Eugene Talmadge's son, nominated to run for the office of Lieutenant
                    Governor. Therefore, if the election was close enough to be referred to the
                    State House of Representatives, the Gene Talmadge supporters could pick Herman
                    Talmadge and not Carmichael, the serving and other candidate for Lieutenant
                    Governor. Normally, someone looking at this situation from the outside might
                    assume that the elected Lieutenant Governor would succeed Governor Talmadge
                    after he died.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, the third man in this controversy was the sitting Governor of Georgia,
                    who refused to give up his office because no qualified successor had been
                    elected to succeed him. The outcome of the election “hung fire” for two or three
                    weeks. The outgoing Governor continued to sit in the Governor's office. I was
                    able to explain this complicated situation to the Oral Board.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you took the oral exam in late 1948.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you do between the time you took the oral exam
                        and yoentered the Foreign Service?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: I was working as a “detail” salesman for E. R. Squibb,
                    thpharmaceuticals firm.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What is a “detail” salesman?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: It has a very specific meaning in the pharmaceuticals business. What a
                    “detail” salesman does, or did in those days, and presumably still does, is to
                    receive a briefing on new products. He becomes familiar with what they are for
                    and how they can be used. Then he goes around and calls on physicians and
                    medical people, hospital pharmacists, and what not. He tries to draw their
                    attention to the new product. In my case, this was what I tried to do for new
                    products being marketed by E. R. Squibb and Sons.</p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>Then one day I got a message from the State Department. They offered me, not a
                    commission as a Foreign Service officer, but as a Foreign Service Staff officer,
                    with the understanding that I would later and more or less “automatically”
                    convert to being a Foreign Service officer. The Department needed people but,
                    for some reason, couldn't appoint them.</p>
                <p>So I took a deep breath and said to myself that I had taken the Foreign Service
                    exam, more or less on a “dare.” If I didn't accept this offer, I would wonder
                    all of my life whether I did the right thing or not. Even though the salary I
                    was being offered as a Foreign Service Staff officer, or an FSS officer,
                    compared to what I was receiving as a “detail salesman” for E. R. Squibb,
                    involved a huge reduction in income, I decided that this was the time to do it.
                    I decided that if I turned down this offer from the Department and continued to
                    work for E. R. Squibb, where I was doing very well, from the salary point of
                    view, it would be a great mistake. I realized that this was the time to try out
                    a diplomatic career in the Department of State, and I never looked back.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So when did you actually enter the Foreign Service?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: May 1, 1949.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You entered the Foreign Service as a Foreign Service
                        Stafofficer. What were you going to do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: It actually turned out that I was appointed to be a Foreign Service
                    “clerk,” as an FSS-13 [specific grade under the Foreign Service Act of 1946]. I
                    thought that I would be sent out to my post in this status. However, the
                    Department caught up with me in about three months. They gave me a “double
                    promotion” from FSS-13 to FSS-11. This only slightly discommoded me in terms of
                    my salary. However, even with this “double promotion” my salary was still less
                    than $3,000 a year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you entered the Foreign Service, did you have any
                        choice ato where you would be sent or what you were going to do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: Stuart, to tell you the truth, I reported on the first working day in
                    May, 1949. I've forgotten whether it was May 1 or 2. My time was initially spent
                    in filling in forms and whatnot. I had been in the Department for two or three
                    days, when I got a call to go and see such and such a person in Personnel.</p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>This person turned out to be a lady, who said: “How would you like to go to
                    Jerusalem?” I said: “Well, I understood that when you join the Foreign Service,
                    you are supposed to go anywhere. If you want me to go to Jerusalem, that's fine.
                    I'll go to Jerusalem.” She said: “Fine. We want you to go to Jerusalem right
                    away to replace a man who has just been shot!” So that's how I was assigned to
                    my first post in the Foreign Service. Mercifully for my predecessor, he was
                    medically evacuated and survived the gunshot wound.</p>
                <p>So I didn't have any initial training course or any other preparation. When this
                    woman from Personnel said: “We want you to go right away,” I replied: “I don't
                    even have a passport!” She said: “Oh, we'll take care of that.” So I was just
                    whisked out to Jerusalem without really knowing very much about the Foreign
                    Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's take this process step by step. How did you get
                        tJerusalem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: That was a drama in itself. Back in 1949, even as it is today, the
                    State Department was very short of money. So the lady in the State Department
                    Travel Office bought me an airline ticket to get me as far as Athens, Greece.
                    That was as close as I was going to get by commercial airline. She said: “Now,
                    Mr. Newberry, when you get to Athens, you go into the Joint Mission,” or
                    whatever it was called, which handled travel arrangements for all American
                    government civilian and military personnel. She said: “They will arrange for you
                    to go on a United Nations plane from Athens to Jerusalem.”</p>
                <p>Well, the people who were doing this administrative work in the embassy in Athens
                    didn't know as much as they should have. They took my passport, which had
                    finally been issued, and wrote a very formal, “Third Person” note, and sent it
                    to what they thought was the legation of Palestine. Of course, there was no such
                    thing. The helpful messenger from the American embassy in Athens took my
                    passport to the Israeli embassy in Athens. The Israelis, smugly I think, were
                    delighted to put an Israeli visa in my diplomatic passport. I didn't know that
                    all of this was going on!</p>
                <p>Then I went to pick up my passport and went out to board the United Nations
                    plane. I found out that it was a C-47, “bucket seat” aircraft which was
                    transporting UN people from the UN Mission in Greece to Jerusalem. What was the
                    UN office called? I think that it was UNSCOP, the UN Special Commission on
                    Palestine. You see, the Greek Civil War was still going on. Anyway, that's why
                    they had this sort of “shuttle aircraft” going around the Middle East. I boarded
                    this UN plane and then became aware that I had an Israeli visa in my passport! I
                    felt vaguely uncomfortable about it, because I had read something in what was
                    then called the “Paris Edition” of the “New York Herald-Tribune” about the
                    problems for American citizens traveling in Arab countries with Israeli visas in
                    their passports.</p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>Well, there I was. Still, I thought that I was going to land in Israel, since the
                    embassy in Athens had gotten an Israeli visa for me. As we were preparing to
                    land at this airstrip called “Columbia,” outside of Jerusalem, I looked out the
                    window and saw all of these people with what looked like “tablecloths” on their
                    heads. I thought: “My God, we're landing at an Arab airport.” So that's how I
                    got to my first Foreign Service post.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you get into Jerusalem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: With difficulty! [Laughter] It was really rather a gripping experience
                    for somebody like me who really didn't know very much about how to conduct
                    himself as a Foreign Service officer. The airstrip at “Columbia” was literally
                    just a landing strip. The paved, asphalt road from Ramallah to Jerusalem ran
                    across the landing strip. There was vehicular traffic going across the landing
                    strip! It was that kind of situation.</p>
                <p>It was getting rather late in the afternoon, and the pilot had to fly on to
                    Beirut that same day. He had to get to Beirut before dark because in 1949 they
                    didn't have any landing lights at Beirut airport. So the pilot and the crew of
                    the airplane were eager to get out of “Columbia” airstrip. While they were
                    getting all of the cargo unloaded, which was destined for delivery to the UN
                    Mission up there at Government House in Jerusalem, I was talking to an obviously
                    European soldier in the uniform of the Arab Legion. He turned out to be an ex
                    “Afrika Korps” German who had somehow escaped becoming a prisoner of war. He had
                    enlisted with the Arab Legion. So there I was, chatting away with him in German,
                    never realizing that I was closing the “trap” around myself by being seen and
                    heard speaking German.</p>
                <p>The point I'm leading up to is that a woman Major in the Arab Legion, and
                    remember that this was in 1949, was in charge of the arrivals and departures of
                    all persons at this airstrip. She was the only officer in the Arab Legion who
                    could speak four foreign languages. Her name was Major Asia Halaby. She held a
                    commission in the Arab Legion. We eventually got on fairly cordial terms, but
                    not that day! She took one look at my passport and said: “Mr. Newberry, you
                    cannot land here!” I said: “Where can I land? I don't have an assignment to
                    Beirut. At least, I'm assigned as a vice consul in Jerusalem. It says so in my
                    passport.” She repeated: “You can't land here!”</p>
                <p>I realized that I was in trouble. So I talked to one of the American Sergeants
                    who had been a passenger on my plane from Athens. I said: “When you get up to
                    the UN Mission at Government House, pass the word back to the American consul
                    over on the Israeli side that the new American vice consul is out at the
                    'Columbia' airstrip and is in trouble.” This Major Halaby had said: “Okay, you
                    can stay, but you're a prisoner of war!” That's when I said to this American
                    sergeant: “For Heaven's sake, get the word to the American consul and tell him
                    what my situation is.”</p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>Well, as it turned out, this Sergeant went to a cocktail party and forgot all
                    about me. However, another one of the UN military people was staying at the same
                    “Bed and Breakfast” place where I was under “house arrest.” Three days later, he
                    saw the American consul, Bill Burdett, on the street in Jerusalem and said:
                    “What are you doing about Newberry?” Bill is now dead, God rest his soul. He
                    said: “Newberry? He's still in Washington.” I found out about this conversation
                    later on. Anyway, once the consulate knew that I was out at “Columbia” airstrip,
                    another vice consul came out and “bailed me out.” That was my arrival at my
                    first post. I had literally been declared to be a “prisoner of war.”</p>
                <p>Q: Dan, could you explain, both for me and for the historical record, what the
                    situation was in Jerusalem in 1949 when you arrived there? How did it appear to
                    you?</p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: I'll be glad to do so. First, let me say what the “technical” situation
                    was. What was referred to as the “Old City,” that is, the entire walled city of
                    Jerusalem, plus the eastern side of the city, including Mt. Scopus and all of
                    the area adjoining it to the East, was controlled by Jordan. This was the
                    situation left over from the first Arab-Israeli War of 1948. The Jordanian Army,
                    made up principally of the Arab Legion, held what is now the West Bank of the
                    Jordan River. That is, the “Old City” of Jerusalem, plus the West Bank of the
                    Jordan River. Israel controlled what was called the “New City” of Jerusalem and
                    everything West to the Mediterranean. So, in effect, we had to deal with two
                    governments in Jerusalem.</p>
                <p>We dealt with the Jordanian “Mutusyarif,” as they called him, the Governor of the
                    “Old City.” On the Israeli side, the Israelis still had a “Military Governor” of
                    Jerusalem. So that was technically the political division of authority.</p>
                <p>As it turned out, we had a little difficulty in getting me started on my assigned
                    duties. Bill Burdett, the American consul in Jerusalem, had already decided that
                    I would have one of the most irksome jobs in the American consulate, because
                    that's what they always do to the most junior officer. [Laughter] That was
                    arranging “clearances” for American travelers to get through what was called the
                    “Mandlebaum Gate.” That is, from the Israeli to the Jordanian occupied sections
                    of Jerusalem. Mandlebaum Gate was actually a square, or a “Platz,” as they say
                    in German.</p>
                <p>Since the “cease-fire lines” happened to be laid in place, Mandlebaum Square was
                    “no man's land” between the Jordanian held sector and the Israeli held sector.
                    There weren't very many American travelers whom either side would allow to cross
                    to the other side. In particular, the Jordanians didn't like people to come
                    first to Israel and then to Jordan. It was my job to arrange for all of these
                    “clearances,” to go and meet these people, and to walk them through “no man's
                    land” and help them with their baggage, since no vehicles could go through this
                    area. That is, unless I happened to have a consulate jeep, which couldn't carry
                    much luggage in any case.</p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>The only kind of vehicle allowed to go through the Mandlebaum Gate was a foreign,
                    consular vehicle. Everything else was stopped. It was like being on the bank of
                    a river where there was no ferry boat. People literally walked across the
                    demarcation line.</p>
                <p>So this was one of my first, assigned duties. However, our old friend, Major Asia
                    Halaby, of the Arab Legion, was also the person who handled the clearances for
                    the Jordanians. During the first two or three weeks that I was doing this job, I
                    had some other duties to handle on the Jordanian side, but my name was not on
                    the Jordanian “clearance list.” Finally, the American consul took the matter up
                    with the Jordanians. Major Asia Halaby said: “We suggest that you assign
                    somebody other than Mr. Newberg” [sic] to that duty.</p>
                <p>Of course, Bill Burdett stood on principle. He got his friend, Wells Stabler, who
                    was the American Charge d'Affaires in Amman, Jordan, to go to the Jordanian
                    Foreign Ministry. Major Halaby was then ordered to let me perform my duties in
                    clearing people to go from the Israeli to the Jordanian side of the line.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think that she must have thought that you were Jewish,
                        becausshe heard you speaking German.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: That's why I mentioned the fact that I was heard speaking German.
                    Eventually, she told me this. She said: “Your name is Daniel, and I heard you
                    speaking German. What else was I to think but that the State Department had
                    committed the great effrontery of assigning a Jewish vice consul here?” As I
                    found out later, that was what was bothering her, although I didn't know it at
                    the time. Actually, I think that the State Department would have had every right
                    to assign a Jewish vice consul to this position. It might have been a little
                    hard on the incumbent, but there was nothing wrong with the principle of
                    assigning a Jewish consular officer to the American consulate in Jerusalem. We
                    had Jewish FSOs and have had them assigned to Jerusalem, but not in 1949. When I
                    thought about what might have happened if the Jordanians had had an American
                    “prisoner of war” in those circumstances, it did not leave me with a very cozy
                    feeling.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the military situation there? Was there a
                        cease-fire athat time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: There was a cease-fire. As I recall it, the truce talks at Rhodes were
                    still going on, although I will have to check the dates. They already had in
                    place the United Nations Truce Supervision Organization (UNTSO), or had it on
                    hand very soon after that. There were multinational contingents monitoring the
                    borders between Syria and Israel, Jordan and Israel, and Egypt and Israel. They
                    had these UN “Truce Supervision Units” based around there. It was a pretty
                    “hairy” [dangerous] business. Some of the personnel assigned to these units came
                    close to great, personal peril in handling this job. It was a very tense time,
                    indeed.</p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>It was also particularly dangerous. I remember, from the time when I was still
                    under “house arrest” at this “Bed and Breakfast” place which was called the
                    “American Colony Hotel” [North of the walled city of Jerusalem]. Actually, it's
                    more than a bed and breakfast place, but I was a newcomer and didn't know the
                    difference.</p>
                <p>I wanted to go to the Anglican Cathedral to attend religious services. They told
                    me at the American Colony Hotel to stick to the main road because there were
                    still land mines that had not been “defused.” It was still a combat situation in
                    May, 1949, even though there was a truce in effect.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the American consulate general in Jerusalem doing
                        ithose days in its relationship with the Arabs and the Israelis?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: It was more a case of what the consulate general was trying to do. It
                    was really an anomalous situation in terms of our relations with our own
                    colleagues. The American ambassador in Tel Aviv insisted that the consulate
                    general in Jerusalem was a “constituent post” of the American mission in Israel.
                    He tried to give orders to the consul general in Jerusalem, but the consul
                    general would have none of it. In consular terms, the consulate general in
                    Jerusalem reported directly to the State Department and not to the embassy in
                    Tel Aviv and not to the Legation in Amman, Jordan. This was about the time when
                    they stopped referring to the country as “Transjordan,” calling it simply,
                    “Jordan.” That was sort of the bureaucratic situation that we had.</p>
                <p>In traditional, Foreign Service practice we all got to know and to cultivate the
                    Military Commander of the Jerusalem Garrison on the Israeli side. He was a
                    colonel named Moshe Dayan [later Israeli Defense Minister and a major Israeli
                    political figure]. He was very approachable. He and his wife were obviously very
                    ambitious. They had what the Europeans used to term a “calling day,” a certain
                    day when new arrivals could go to Dayan's house and meet all sorts of
                    interesting people.</p>
                <p>That's what I did, even though I had no reason to meet higher ranking officials.
                    So I got to know Moshe Dayan and his sister, who was being “courted” by one of
                    our officers. I won't say which one. Moshe Dayan's sister-in-law married a young
                    Israeli Air Force Lieutenant. I was lucky enough to be invited to the wedding.
                    That young Lieutenant was named Ezer Weizman, who is now President of Israel.
                    [Laughter]</p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>It was an unusual situation where a young, low-ranking Foreign Service officer,
                    in fact, the most junior FSO, had regular access to these Israeli “movers and
                    shakers.” Just as during a later part of my experience in Jerusalem, toward the
                    end of my tour there, I just “happened” to be on the Arab side of Jerusalem one
                    day in August, 1952, when something terribly dramatic happened inside the Old
                    City. I found out that King Abdullah of Jordan had been assassinated in a
                    mosque! I was the only officer in our consulate general who knew this. I was
                    trying to alert the other side of the line, while still doing my job as a
                    reporting officer.</p>
                <p>So for the next several days all of us in the consulate general were trying to
                    piece together what had happened. Obviously, the Jordanian Police moved in and
                    arrested people right and left. However, it was just my luck that I happened to
                    be in a place where nobody in the American consulate general would have known
                    about what had happened for hours until the BBC [British Broadcasting
                    Commission] reported what had happened. I was able to contribute to the
                    reporting on this event.</p>
                <p>Q: You mentioned that you had contacts, even as a young officer, among the
                    “movers and shakers” on the Israeli side. What about on the Jordanian side?</p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: I was just going to say that, in the context of this quick “round up”
                    of people who were arrested by the Jordanians, was what I thought was one of my
                    best contacts. He was explaining a lot of things to me. I guess that he was a
                    nephew of the famous Mufti Hajamin al-Husseini, who was very prominent among
                    Palestinians. My friend was arrested and eventually hanged for alleged
                    involvement in the conspiracy to kill King Abdullah! I began to think that
                    acquaintanceship with my friends, the people whom I was cultivating, was
                    potentially dangerous.</p>
                <p>This reminds me of the fable of La Fontaine about the two donkeys in the caravan
                    train. One of them was carrying a load of hay and one of them was carrying a
                    load of gold coins. I'm sure you know the story. During the night thieves ripped
                    open the bags of the donkey carrying the gold coins. Of course, the donkey was
                    stabbed to death. However, the donkey carrying the hay was undisturbed. The
                    moral of this story was: “It's not always a good thing to have an important
                    job!” That's what I was beginning to think, as this has happened to many Foreign
                    Service people, including people you knew and drank coffee with, who wound up on
                    the “wrong side” of the political spectrum and came to grief. You know, this
                    came as quite a revelation to me and to my outlook on life when I was a “young
                    boy,” as I thought of myself, only 27 years old.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of Jordan when you first arrived
                        in thacountry, including how it was run, where it was going, and all of
                        that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>NEWBERRY: Well, Stu, I can only give a very circumscribed response to that very
                    good question. As a “new kid on the block,” I was so concentrated on getting my
                    work done, and it was a very busy job, that I didn't really have the leisure to
                    go out and sort of “explore” things.</p>
                <p>We didn't have “professional” diplomatic couriers. We took it in turn to drive
                    our diplomatic pouches over to Amman, Jordan. I would chat with the people in
                    our Legation there, which consisted of two rooms in the Philadelphia Hotel. So I
                    picked up impressions regarding the situation. However, my recollection of those
                    years is very limited. The British were still very much “running the show.” That
                    impression has lingered with me, especially after King Abdullah was
                    assassinated. Abdullah's successor, King Khalal, was mentally so limited. Then,
                    it was some further time before the “Brave, Young King,” Hussein, really began
                    to take control of the situation. But during all of this time, from 1950 to
                    about 1960, it seemed to me that the British were still very much “calling the
                    shots.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about Israel? What was your impression and the
                        reaction oour people in Jerusalem toward the Israelis?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: I have to say, quite candidly, that I was personally shocked, when I
                    arrived at the consulate general in Jerusalem, to find that, to a man, our
                    people were all very “anti-Israeli.” I was shocked at this because, first of
                    all, as I told you, some of my best friends and closest “buddies” in the U.S.
                    Army during World War II had been Jewish refugees from Nazism. I was prepared to
                    be “open minded” about Israel. However, as I learned more about some of the more
                    terrible things that the “Hagganah,” the most prominent of the Jewish
                    organizations, did during the first Arab-Jewish War [in 1948], I began to
                    appreciate that there really were two sides to the Arab-Jewish conflict.</p>
                <p>Then, at a certain point, the line from “Romeo and Juliet,” about “a plague on
                    both your houses” appeared more reasonable to me. “A plague on both your houses”
                    was pretty much my attitude during the rest of my time in Jerusalem, because
                    such outrageous things were done on both sides. I think that I was honestly
                    “neutral” by the time I finished my tour of duty in Jerusalem.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Either then, or not too long afterwards, our consul
                        general wakilled, and nobody, even to this day, knows who killed him.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>NEWBERRY: I heard many, almost eyewitness stories. I think that it is beyond
                    debate that our consul general, Tom Watson, was killed by a sniper. They still
                    had his “bulletproof vest” hanging up in the consulate general which was
                    supposed to protect him. However, the bullet entered right under his armpit and
                    went right past the “bulletproof vest.” So, despite taking precautions, he was
                    killed in that way. I haven't made a detailed study of this matter, but on the
                    basis of circumstantial evidence I believe that the sniper could only have been
                    on the Israeli side. Well, I don't really know. However, the point is that, when
                    he was killed, Consul General Watson was either going to or coming back from a
                    meeting of the Special Consular Commission which was trying to implement the
                    truce. He was on an errand of peace, either coming or going, when he was shot by
                    this sniper.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you think that that contributed to the bitterness of
                        the peoplin the consulate general toward the Israelis?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: It may have, because the man that I replaced was also shot, presumably
                    from the same direction. However, he survived. So that's part of it. I think
                    that the natural, sort of “social” contacts of the Americans in the consulate
                    general, especially those who couldn't speak any other language but English, was
                    with the military and civilian people in Government House. I would have to say
                    that they were pretty much anti-Israeli.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the relations between the consulate general and
                        I guesthat by now it was our embassy in Tel Aviv?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: We had an embassy in Tel Aviv. The ambassador was “political”
                    appointee.</p>
                <p>Q: Who was the ambassador?</p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: His name was James McDonald. He was a prominent and perhaps the
                    leading, Gentile “Zionist” in the United States. He was “rushed out” to Tel Aviv
                    shortly after the United States recognized Israel in 1948. He didn't know much
                    about the State Department, but he thought that he had access to the White
                    House, [then under President Truman]. He attempted, without success, to persuade
                    the consulate general in Jerusalem to consider itself a “constituent post” of
                    the embassy.</p>
                <p>Ambassador McDonald's performance in Tel Aviv is interesting, in retrospect. I
                    liked him personally but I thought that he was not a good choice to be
                    ambassador in Israel at that time. He didn't serve in Tel Aviv until toward the
                    end of the Truman administration. We had a career FSO as the second American
                    ambassador to Israel, Lynette Davis.</p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>I was assigned to temporary duty in the embassy in Tel Aviv for the last few
                    months of my tour in Israel. This was during the interim period when we were
                    waiting to know who the new ambassador to Israel would be. I remember hearing a
                    youngish Israeli Foreign Ministry official telling me: “Well, we hope that the
                    new American ambassador will be a career officer, because we know that in the
                    State Department they discounted everything that Ambassador McDonald said. We
                    want an American ambassador who will report accurately what we say to him.” Of
                    course, since Ambassador McDonald was such a partisan of Israel, he was
                    interpreting what the Israelis said to him, and the Israelis didn't want that.
                    The Israelis just wanted an accurate report of what they told him.</p>
                <p>I had not been in Israel since that first tour, but the Israelis had obviously
                    learned how to “operate” in Washington. However, at that time, which was just a
                    year after Israel became independent, they were still “feeling their way” as to
                    how best to influence the development of U.S.-Israeli relations. Having an
                    all-out, pro-Zionist American ambassador in Tel Aviv was not their idea of the
                    ideal situation.</p>
                <p>Q: It still isn't. Just recently our ambassador to Israel was actually an
                    Australian citizen who had also been a lobbyist for the Israeli government. Then
                    he was naturalized as an American citizen and is now the Assistant Secretary in
                    the Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs.</p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: Well, you said it, Stu. I didn't, but I'm not disputinany of the irony
                    in your remark.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is a very “dubious” situation, to say the least.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: I think that, as an aside, that applies to sending, how should I say
                    it, “hyphenated” Americans as ambassador to any country where they are closely
                    associated with either the culture or the politics of the country in which they
                    are supposed to represent the United States.</p>
                <p>Q: I know that recently we had a Greek-American ambassador to Greece. I heard
                    that his views on Greek-American relations were completely discounted in
                    Washington, because his reporting was so “biased.”</p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: There's another side to such a situation, too. I am talking now, not so
                    much of the ambassador, but of American Jews who may be assigned to the embassy
                    in Tel Aviv. When I was in Jerusalem and then, briefly and for several months at
                    the embassy in Tel Aviv, the labor attache at the American embassy was a very
                    sharp guy. His name was Milton Fried. He was the only identifiable,
                    Jewish-American officer in the American embassy.</p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>The reason he was chosen for the position of Labor Attache, and he told me this
                    himself, was that he was the son-in-law of Sidney Hillsman, a very prominent
                    American labor leader. However, he said privately to me: “This is not a place
                    for an American Jew to be assigned. All of the Israelis think that, because I'm
                    a Jew, they can 'use me.' In fact, I'm an American, and I resent this attitude.”
                    Those were pretty much his words. It's awkward to be in such a situation.</p>
                <p>Q: We've run across this in a number of countries. Well, during the time that you
                    were in Jerusalem, were there any incidents or events which particularly come to
                    your mind which you or the consulate general had to deal with?</p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: I can tell you of some “colorful things” that I had to deawith.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's hear them.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: In the Table of Organization of the consulate general in Jerusalem, I
                    was called the “citizenship officer.” We did not issue visas, thank God. I think
                    that most Foreign Service officers who haven't done visa work consider
                    themselves very lucky not to have had that kind of assignment. I have great
                    respect for visa officers, and some of my best friends are visa officers, and
                    all of that. However, I consider that my assignment to the consulate general in
                    Jerusalem was very interesting, and I learned a lot about consular work, but
                    very little about visas.</p>
                <p>Let me get on to citizenship matters. This had a particular angle because I was
                    assigned to Jerusalem. In 1949 one of the things that the citizenship officer in
                    Jerusalem had to do was to keep track of all of the American veterans in our
                    consular district who were entitled to receive benefits under the “GI Bill”
                    [legislation enacted in 1945 to help veterans attend college or other training
                    courses]. There were lots of veterans in Jerusalem at the time, and they all
                    wanted their checks delivered on time. I had to make sure, if they were
                    attending Hebrew University, for example, that they received their money on
                    time. This involved a big, administrative problem.</p>
                <p>There were other aspects of this citizenship job. There were many naturalized
                    American citizens in the Jerusalem consular district who were probably very
                    close to the “point” of automatically expatriating themselves. Under the
                    Nationality Act of 1949, a naturalized, American citizen could not remain
                    overseas indefinitely. So I found myself having to prepare certificates of
                    expatriation for American citizens. When I learned the job, I anticipated this
                    situation and I would call them in and tell them that if they didn't go back to
                    the U.S., they would lose their American nationality.</p>
                <p>Most of these people didn't speak any English. They spoke Yiddish. So there I was
                    with my college German. I spoke German to them, and they would answer in
                    Yiddish. So that's the way we communicated.</p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>I think that most people who are acquainted with that part of the world are aware
                    of those extreme, Orthodox Jews who have been sort of caricatures. These Jews,
                    many of them from Poland, wore big, black hats, had side curls in their hair,
                    and big, black gabardine coats. There was a community of these Orthodox Jews in
                    a certain quarter of Jerusalem who were American citizens. I had them as
                    “customers,” too.</p>
                <p>Of course, I didn't have any political objection to them, but I had to keep on
                    good terms with them. First of all, because they were American citizens and,
                    secondly, because we had to pass through their community, even on the Sabbath,
                    to get to the Mandlebaum Gate. Several times I had stones thrown at me in this
                    area, the Mea Sharim quarter of Jerusalem, because they considered that I was
                    “desecrating” the Sabbath. In fact, I was like a postman, doing my appointed
                    rounds, but they didn't like it when I passed through their quarter on the
                    Sabbath.</p>
                <p>What I'm leading up to is that these people were a very important, colorful, and
                    even “pungent” part of my recollection of Jerusalem. These people took their
                    ritual baths before they came in to meet me, but they never washed their
                    clothes! You can imagine, in a warm climate like that of Jerusalem, what they
                    smelled like when they came into my office! I'm not kidding you. I reached the
                    point where I would have to stand by the window and keep them all the way across
                    the room, just to be able to talk to them. It was that bad! Sorry to go into
                    this aspect in such detail, but if you want to talk about “color,” that's one of
                    the more “colorful” sides of doing citizenship work in Jerusalem!</p>
                <p>Then, over on the Jordan side of the consular district, I had more “colorful”
                    experiences. Of course, when I first got to Jerusalem, we didn't have any sort
                    of office over on the Jordan, or Arab, side of the city, because, as it turned
                    out, the office building of the consulate general was on Ramallah Road in the
                    “New City” of Jerusalem.</p>
                <p>As it turned out, we were eventually able to use a couple of rooms in the
                    building housing the American School of Oriental Research in the Old City of
                    Jerusalem. The citizenship officer (that is, me) held office hours there, one
                    day a week. Anybody who had claims to Social Security checks or who needed to
                    register the birth of one of their children who had claims to being American
                    citizens (for many Arabs were American citizens), could meet with the
                    citizenship officer at the American School of Oriental Research.</p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>On another day in the week I went up to Ramallah, which was perhaps half an
                    hour's drive from Jerusalem. I had office hours at the Quaker School in Ramallah
                    one morning a week for Arab Americans who came in to discuss citizenship
                    problems. I can give you an example. It is curious to note that some of these
                    people were actually shepherds. Their parents, or some of the older members of
                    this community, somehow had gotten jobs in war industries in the U.S. during
                    World War II. They stayed on in the U.S. long enough to acquire rights to a
                    Social Security pension. Then they came back to Palestine and were re-absorbed
                    into their own culture. When their children were born, they may or may not have
                    been eligible to be registered as American citizens. So I really had to know
                    U.S. citizenship law, inside and out. Otherwise, I would have been “zapped”
                    [disavowed] by the Passport Office back in Washington.</p>
                <p>Q: Did you get into any difficulties with Jordanian or Israeli authorities as you
                    went along your appointed rounds? I mean, after you got over the initial
                    problems you had with the Jordanians.</p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: Not really. I can't recall that either side treated me discourteously,
                    once they understood what I was doing. My greatest fear was that, because of the
                    sort of “front line” atmosphere, I might wind up taking the wrong road. I
                    remember once on a beautiful, spring day some friends of mine and I went out
                    with a picnic basket. We took the wrong road and wound up in the middle of “No
                    Man's Land.” We tried to sneak back as quietly as we could, because in that
                    atmosphere any frontier guard might have just shot us, if he'd seen us out
                    there. My main concern was inadvertently making the “wrong move.” As far as
                    courtesy or discourtesy, helpfulness or unhelpfulness, I never encountered any
                    of that. Granted, I was doing things which were politically pretty much
                    “neutral.” If you asked my superiors for their views, such as the consul
                    general, if he were still alive, you might get an entirely different answer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the consul general?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: The first one was Raleigh Gibson. He had not yet arrived, and Bill
                    Burdett was acting consul general. Gibson had been consul general in Salonika,
                    Greece. I remember his telling stories about the famous “Wood and Pulp Case.” I
                    think that he was consul general in Salonika at that time. He finished his tour
                    of duty as consul general in Jerusalem. Younger officers who don't know their
                    way around Washington and don't have a “network” of friends and supporters back
                    in Washington may have trouble finding out what's going on. After Gibson left
                    Jerusalem, we had another long period of time when there was no consul general
                    assigned. Roger Tyler then became acting consul general and served in that
                    capacity for quite a long time. He replaced Bill Burdett. We didn't have Raleigh
                    Gibson's successor as consul general until I had left Jerusalem.I was out in
                    Jerusalem for two and one-half years. We had a fully accredited consul general
                    there for a little less than a year during that period of time.</p>
                <p>Q: You mentioned that the officers in the consulate general in Jerusalem were
                    basically “anti-Israeli.” What would you say was the root cause of this
                    attitude?</p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>NEWBERRY: I mentioned their association with the UN people, and there were still
                    a lot of British officials around. The British in Jerusalem had particularly
                    bitter memories of what the Hagganah [Jewish Agency] and what the Irgun Zvai
                    Leumi [IZL] did to the British troops in Jerusalem. My colleagues in the
                    consulate general, who had been in Jerusalem longer than I, would talk about
                    “horror stories” dating back to this period. Well, that's about the best answer
                    that I can give.</p>
                <p>I had so much on my mind about learning how to do my job that I can't say that I
                    spent a lot of time analyzing the views of my own colleagues. That's just my
                    recollection of the situation, and I can't help you much more than that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have many visitors to the consulate general in
                        Jerusalem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: Yes, in spite of everything. You asked for color. I'll give you some
                    color. I was assigned to make all of the arrangements for official Americans
                    crossing through the Mandlebaum Gate, both from Israel to Jordan and from Jordan
                    to Israel. I think that this particular incident happened during the second
                    Christmas time that I spent in Jerusalem.</p>
                <p>A strange, shall I say, “coincidence,” or whatever the word is, occurred. Former
                    Governor of Minnesota Harold Stassen, a famous name in American politics of that
                    era, came to visit Jerusalem. I've forgotten what his position was at that time,
                    but he was a perennial [and unsuccessful] Republican candidate for President. I
                    can't recall precisely when this happened. Maybe he was still Governor of
                    Minnesota. Anyway, we learned that he was coming to Jerusalem by way of Tel
                    Aviv. I was asked to arrange for him to go across into Jordan through the
                    Mandlebaum Gate at night. He wanted to go to Bethlehem to attend a Christmas Eve
                    ceremony of some kind.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, we got word that old Senator Theodore Green (Democrat, Rhode Island)
                    was coming to Jerusalem for a visit. However, Senator Green was coming to
                    Jerusalem by way of Jordan. Senator Green was just about as durable in his own
                    way as Senator Strom Thurmond (Democrat and later Republican, South Carolina).
                    They both wanted to go to the Christmas Eve celebration, including Midnight
                    Mass, in Bethlehem. So the consul general arranged to get over there, at the
                    Mandlebaum Gate, and meet the car that brought Senator Green from Amman, Jordan.
                    They were waiting in the car on the eastern side of Mandlebaum Gate at about
                    11:00 PM on Christmas Eve. I was coming from Israel and making my way to
                    Mandlebaum Gate with Governor Stassen. We got over in the car, a large car. So I
                    got Governor Stassen, the consul general, and Senator Green into this large car.
                    However, I had the impression that Senator Green wouldn't speak to me!</p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>What I discovered as we moved along was that this was one of the “tricks” of old
                    Senator Green. He could fall asleep with his eyes open! In fact, he used to do
                    that on the floor of the Senate in Washington. So that was why he apparently
                    wouldn't speak to me. He was asleep!</p>
                <p>***</p>
                <p>Q: This is the second interview done with Daniel O. Newberry. This is in 1997. I
                    guess that we are just about the end of your tour in Jerusalem. One thing you
                    might discuss. Did you feel, in Jerusalem, the “heavy hand” of the pro-Israeli
                    press and politics in the United States? Or did this really come later?</p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: Stu, my impression was that the pro-Israeli press had already won,
                    hands down. There was no contest, from our perspective. There wasn't any
                    pro-Arab press in the U.S., from our perspective. All of the American news
                    media, including radio and what there was of television [TV] at the time, were
                    pro-Israel. At least, that is the impression that we had out there.</p>
                <p>Q: Was there any concern on our part about the Arabs who, for one reason or
                    another, had been forced out of their traditional homes in Greater Palestine,
                    which is now part of Israel, as refugees? Were we reporting or thinking about
                    that at all?</p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: We were reporting on it, insofar as the small staff at the American
                    consulate general had the leisure to report these things. The embassy in Tel
                    Aviv was not particularly interested in that aspect of the subject. The legation
                    in Amman did some reporting because they had huge camps of Palestinian refugees
                    on the East bank of the Jordan River.</p>
                <p>Yes, we were concerned about this. We were talking previously about the “well
                    springs” of anti-Israel feeling. I could see this with my own eyes. This is a
                    technique that the Israelis still use. You create refugees when you want to,
                    quite simply by bulldozing their houses. That is still a standard technique.</p>
                <p>When I first went to Jaffa, which is a suburb of Tel Aviv, it looked like one of
                    these old European cities destroyed during World War II. Jaffa, as a city, goes
                    back to the time of the Crusades and before that, even to Biblical times. Jaffa
                    looked like one of these old, European cities which were absolutely devastated
                    during World War II. I asked people: “Where was all of the fighting? Nobody said
                    anything about pitched battles here.” I was told: “Oh, no, the Israelis
                    demolished the town after the fighting was over.” The Israelis had just about
                    flattened the entire, old city of Jaffa, just to make sure that the Arabs didn't
                    have any place to come back to. That is just an example of their attitudes.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you came back to Jaffa, did this type of thing cause
                        feelings of revulsion among your colleagues, and maybe you? At this point
                        the American public was sort of cheering for the “plucky Jews” to beat back
                        the Arabs and all of that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: People tended to speak of “brave, little Israel.” However, Stu, I have
                    to say that in the “culture” of the Foreign Service in those days nobody was
                    particularly interested in “debriefing” junior officers freshly back from their
                    posts.</p>
                <p>Q: They still don't. They don't “debrief” the senior officers, either. The
                    closest thing we have to debriefing is the process that's going on here, 50
                    years after the fact.</p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: Anyway, inexperienced officers like me were wondering what was going to
                    happen to them next. I have no memory or any impression of anybody wanting to
                    “pick my brains.”</p>
                <p>However, when I got to Atlanta for home leave, somehow “the word” got around that
                    a local, home town boy had returned from being a vice consul in Jerusalem. The
                    Hadassah Business Women's Club [Jewish community group] invited me to be a
                    speaker at one of their meetings. I wondered how many businesswomen there were
                    in Atlanta, and Jewish businesswomen at that. Atlanta was still not a very big
                    city in 1949. This program was held at a Jewish country club in Atlanta. I was
                    graciously received and then taken into the room where I was going to make my
                    little speech. There were about 800 women in the room! They all wanted to hear
                    everything that they could possibly hear about Jerusalem.</p>
                <p>I would have to contrast this reception with the attitude of officers in the
                    State Department toward one of their professional colleagues in talking about
                    his experiences in Jerusalem. They might even have learned something from my
                    talk! These Jewish businesswomen in Atlanta wanted to get everything out of me
                    that they could. They were a very good, sharp audience.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there in Jerusalem from 1949 until when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: From the first part of May, 1949, until some time in October, 1951. As
                    I said before, during the last few months of that period I was on temporary duty
                    at the embassy in Tel Aviv, although still technically assigned to
                    Jerusalem.</p>
                <p>Q: Let's talk a little about your reaction to being in Tel Aviv. I am speaking
                    now of the atmosphere in our embassy there, as opposed to the consulate general
                    in Jerusalem. Was there a difference in how things were regarded and dealt with
                    there?</p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>NEWBERRY: There was a definite difference in the atmosphere, because the people
                    in our embassy in Tel Aviv had no contact, to speak of, with Arabs at all. That
                    led to a built-in difference in outlook. It was a “different window on the
                    world.”</p>
                <p>Of course, I had never been in an embassy before. I didn't even know how to work
                    in an embassy. I was assigned to temporary duty in the Economic Section of the
                    embassy. I had a certain set of subjects that I worked on. Talk about “color”?
                    I'll give you another bit of “color.” In those days we had “despatches,” as you
                    may remember. This was the only time that I ever wrote a despatch. The State
                    Department was very proud of spelling the word “despatch” with an “e,” rather
                    than with an “i.”</p>
                <p>One of the things that I got interested in, and this was one of the ironies of
                    the Foreign Service, was the “vanity” of my superiors. They wanted their
                    sections to be fully staffed and to show that they were “overworked.” In fact,
                    the embassy was not “overstaffed.” Nevertheless, they insisted on getting this
                    young officer, me, who had been assigned to Jerusalem, moved up to the
                    embassy.</p>
                <p>There really wasn't enough work for me to do. There wasn't enough office space,
                    either. There were four officers in a room half as big as this room. You know
                    the dimensions of it. It was like the “City Room” of an old newspaper. We almost
                    literally had to “climb over” each other to get in and out of the office.
                    However, there I was in the embassy, even though I wasn't really “needed.”</p>
                <p>I thought of subjects to write reports on. I decided to write a report on the
                    Israeli fishing industry. It was very poorly developed in those days. I realized
                    that one of the keys to the fishing industry was the dietary laws and the
                    “Kosher” rules about what kind of fish could be eaten. That is, whether the fish
                    were scaled or unscaled, skinned or unskinned, and so forth. I had a Biblical
                    quotation at the beginning of my despatch. In my experience this was the only
                    time that I dared start off a despatch to the Department of State, quoting the
                    Bible. This may still be rare.</p>
                <p>However, I had a lot of fun and learned a lot about why the Israelis, at that
                    point, hadn't done anything with their fishing industry. This despatch had to do
                    with that. In Turkey, in the olden times, it had been the Greeks who did all of
                    the fishing. The Turks had to learn how to catch fish, and the Israelis also had
                    to learn how to be fishermen.</p>
                <p>Q: I thought that we might stop at this point and pick up the thread of your
                    story the next time. In 1951 you were transferred from Jerusalem. Where did you
                    go?</p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>NEWBERRY: After home leave and about a 10-week training course at the Department
                    of Commerce, I was assigned to the consulate general in Istanbul. The course at
                    the Department of Commerce dealt with how Foreign Service officers should do
                    economic and commercial work. Perhaps we can go into that next time, because how
                    I got this assignment is also a commentary on how the personnel system worked in
                    the Department of State.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All right, good. We'll pick it up then.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>***</p>
                <p>Today is December 9, 1997. We are continuing with an interview of Dan Newberry.
                    Dan, perhaps you can go into how you were assigned to this commercial course.
                    When did you take this course?</p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: It began at the end of 1951. During the last five months of my
                    assignment to the consulate general in Jerusalem, I had been on temporary duty
                    at the embassy in Tel Aviv, doing economic reporting. I received my “Home Leave”
                    orders in September, 1951, with no “onward assignment” mentioned. However, I
                    learned that I was being assigned to take a training course at the Department of
                    Commerce after taking home leave in Atlanta. This training course was designed
                    to teach younger Foreign Service officers how to do economic and commercial
                    reporting.</p>
                <p>So I reported to the Department of Commerce before I went on home leave. I
                    learned some very instructive things about how the Foreign Service training
                    system really worked, if you'll bear with me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: My supervisor at the embassy in Tel Aviv, Owen Jones, who, praise the
                    Lord, is still living, told me: “I know the man who is in charge of that course
                    at the Department of Commerce. His name is Herb Cummings. I'll write and let him
                    know that you're going to be taking that course. When you get to Washington,
                    look in on him.”</p>
                <p>When I arrived in Washington and reported in at the Department of Commerce, a
                    secretary there said: “Mr. Cummings is on a field trip, but I'll make a note of
                    your name. When he comes back from this trip, we'll arrange for you to come in
                    and call on him.”</p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>Well, a couple of weeks went by, and I was well into the training course. Then I
                    received word that I should come in to see Mr. Cummings. It turned out that Mr.
                    Cummings had just come back from a trip to Turkey. I was very much interested in
                    what was going on there. While Cumming was on this trip to Turkey, the chief of
                    the Economic Section in Istanbul called his attention to the fact that a woman
                    officer who was assigned to the Economic Section was about to leave on transfer
                    to another post. The Department had not assigned her replacement. The chief of
                    the Economic Section told Cummings: “What I really need is a bright-eyed and
                    bushy-tailed, young Foreign Service officer, because there is a lot that can be
                    made out of this job.”</p>
                <p>So, as it turned out, I was the first FSO who walked into Mr. Cummings' office,
                    and he said: “How would you like to go to Istanbul?” If some other guy had
                    walked into Cummings' office, he would probably have asked the same question,
                    but it happened to be me. This was a very important event in my professional
                    career. In fact, as we'll get around to talking about later, I did three tours
                    of duty in Turkey and became something of a Turkish “specialist.” This all got
                    started because I happened to walk into Cumming's office at the right moment,
                    and he asked me if I would like to go to Istanbul. I said: “Yes,” but it was not
                    as easily arranged as well this.</p>
                <p>Q: What about the training course itself? What was the attitude in the Department
                    of State toward the Department of Commerce at that time? Attitudes toward
                    assignments to Commerce have varied over the years. I was wondering what
                    attitudes were at that time.</p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: My impression was that the attitude of State Department officers toward
                    the Department of Commerce was very “cooperative.” There was no particular
                    resentment or disdain on the part of the younger Foreign Service officers
                    attending this course toward an assignment to do economic or commercial work.
                    Granted that my colleagues and I were fairly low down on the totem pole. I think
                    that the guy who served the longest in our group taking the Department of
                    Commerce course had been in the Foreign Service for about eight years. Of
                    course, I had been in the Foreign Service for less than three years. We had not
                    developed the tradition of disdain that you may have seen in other people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the emphasis in the training program?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: A lot of it had to do with statistical analysis and how to gather and
                    make use of statistical data. There was a lot of emphasis on what international
                    trade agreements required the U.S. to do and what trade preferences were. It was
                    sort of an undergraduate course in foreign trade. It was more or less “Foreign
                    Trade 101.”</p>
                <p>Q: What was your impression when you completed the course? Did you feel a little
                    more ready to tackle the problems of being an economic and commercial
                    officer?</p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>NEWBERRY: It might have been an illusion, but I did feel that I was better
                    prepared to do economic and commercial work than I had been before I took the
                    course.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then how did your assignment process work out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: That's what I wanted to add a footnote to, because everybody concerned
                    seemed to be delighted that Dan Newberry was being assigned to Istanbul. I wrote
                    all of the usual letters to the consul general and the ambassador. I began
                    making my travel preparations and made a reservation on a ship, because we had
                    to travel by ship in those days. I went on home leave. When that was over, I
                    still had not yet received my travel orders to proceed up to New York to take
                    the ship to Istanbul. By this time it was early in the New Year [1952]. I still
                    didn't have any travel orders, and the Department didn't answer my letters. So I
                    came back to Washington. While I was waiting in the Office of Personnel, I
                    overheard a conversation between two people. They had these “modular” walls
                    [about five feet high and fairly thin] in those days. I heard a lady saying to
                    her colleague: “We can't let Newberry go to Istanbul and replace a woman. There
                    are very few places in NEA [Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs] where it is
                    established that a woman can work effectively. I want to put a woman in that
                    job.” However, I was not to be deterred. So I got in touch with my “new friend,”
                    Mr. Cummings, over in the Department of Commerce and told him: “There are people
                    over here in the State Department who are trying to 'thwart' you. They don't
                    want me to go to Istanbul.” He said: “I'll take care of that.”</p>
                <p>That was the last I heard of this problem. Within 48 hours I had my travel
                    orders. I went up to New York and put my car on the ship I was traveling on,
                    which was one of the group of ships known as the “Four Aces.” That was the way
                    we traveled in those days if our posts were on a sea lane. So that's how I went
                    to Istanbul in early March, 1952.</p>
                <p>Q: So by your fortuitous overhearing this conversation, you were able to resolve
                    the problem. This is an example of a “low level, bureaucratic block.”</p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: It was, indeed, a “low level, bureaucratic block.” It was simply a
                    matter of the Office of Personnel trying to preserve a “slot” which they had
                    earmarked for a woman. You might call it “reverse discrimination” in these days.
                    Fortunately, I was lucky enough to be able to outmaneuver them. I got to
                    Istanbul, and this was the beginning of a long and happy association with
                    Turkey.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This time you were in Istanbul from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: From March, 1952, to August, 1956. This was rather a lontime for a
                    lower-ranking officer.</p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Istanbul was a consulate general.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your job at the consulate general in Istanbul?
                        What wathe official job title?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: My assignment was to the Economic-Commercial Section in the consulate
                    general. I had certain, specific reporting responsibilities. The most
                    “picturesque” job was to prepare the quarterly report on “Filberts,” or
                    “Hazelnuts.” This was in the days before we had an agricultural attache in the
                    embassy in Ankara. In the division of labor the embassy in Ankara had assigned
                    the preparation of the “Filbert” report to the consulate general in Istanbul
                    because most of the Turkish “Filbert” exporters had their offices in Istanbul
                    [or “Stamboul” in French; the two names for the city were used interchangeably].
                    If you'll pardon my expression, I really “sank my teeth” into those hazelnuts
                    and had a ball with them.</p>
                <p>Also, I did a lot of the reporting on Turkish customs practices. I spent a lot of
                    time studying and getting acquainted with the great, bureaucratic “maze” of
                    Turkish import customs, because we had so many American business firms which
                    were registering complaints of the difficulties and delays they were
                    experiencing. Of course, as a junior officer, I fell heir to the most irksome
                    duties to handle, but I found this quite an education.</p>
                <p>Q: Could you talk about any of the problems created by the Turkish bureaucracy
                    for American firms which were trying to work in Turkey in those days?</p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: As I look back on this period, it seems to me that the Turkish
                    restrictions were not particularly aimed at Americans, Europeans, or anyone else
                    engaged in exporting goods to Turkey. Everyone faced the same, bureaucratic
                    hurdles. Even to this day the Turks have not entirely shaken off the heritage of
                    the Ottoman bureaucracy. Although by the 1980s the system had been relatively
                    simplified, in the 1950s the old, Ottoman bureaucratic procedures and
                    regulations were still very much in play. It was just impossible to get things
                    done expeditiously, even by “passing money under the table,” as some of the
                    foreign businessmen did. The Turkish system was very old-fashioned. It was
                    designed, not to encourage imports, but to protect what the Turkish bureaucracy
                    thought was a budding, Turkish industry. In some cases there was no Turkish
                    industry in a given field at all, but the Turkish bureaucracy was still
                    “protecting” home industry, just in case it emerged.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you do as a junior officer in the consulate
                        general iIstanbul in dealing with these problems?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>NEWBERRY: I set about systematically getting acquainted, mainly with the English-
                    speaking officials in the Turkish Customs Office and in Turkish banking
                    institutions. I was also picking up economic data along the way. In the whole
                    Economic-Commercial Section of the consulate general we had three officers, plus
                    the Section Chief, so there were four of us. We had a certain list of economic
                    “indicators” which we had to collect data on.</p>
                <p>We systematically made the rounds of our contacts in the market. In my case I
                    could speak French. In those days most of the Turkish Jews spoke French, rather
                    than English, so it was very useful for me to talk to Jewish businessmen in
                    French. However, it took me a long while before I learned enough Turkish to
                    conduct business in that language. So during the first two or three years that I
                    was in Turkey I did not use Turkish as a working language.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: From your perspective, what was your impression of the
                        Turkiseconomy during the period 1952-1956?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: My impression was that it was really stagnant. All of the industry in
                    Turkey of any size at all was owned by the Turkish state. This was Kemal
                    Ataturk's principle, which they called “etatism,” or state ownership. Ataturk
                    had decreed that at that stage of Turkey's development all industries should be
                    owned by the state. In effect, state enterprises constituted perhaps 90 percent
                    of the Turkish industrial base, with all that that entailed. There was the usual
                    lack of vision that you get when so much of the economy is dominated by
                    state-owned enterprises.</p>
                <p>So this situation was very frustrating for American businessmen to deal with.
                    Although the Turkish National Assembly passed a law to encourage foreign capital
                    investment, it did not yield any results to speak of. Certainly, as far as
                    traditional American exports like Coca-Cola or Pepsi-Cola were concerned, these
                    were not available in the Turkish market. No foreign soft drinks could come into
                    Turkey in the 1950s, for example. The same thing was true of textiles. The Turks
                    had their own textile industry, and they certainly were not going to allow
                    foreign competition for that industry. The import duties on textiles were very
                    high. For example, if a Turkish lady went abroad and bought three meters of silk
                    cloth in Paris to have a dress made out of it, she would probably have to pay
                    three times the price of what she had paid for it, in Turkish customs duty. This
                    is an example of how prohibitive it was for the average Turk in the 1950s to
                    import anything into Turkey.</p>
                <p>So it was rather a bleak scene, and the city of Istanbul looked that way. I had
                    the impression, when I first arrived in Istanbul, that nothing had been done to
                    “freshen up” the city since 1914!</p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>Q: What was the Turkish government like? Obviously, Ankara was where the American
                    ambassador was stationed. From what you gathered from your own observations and
                    from comments of your colleagues, what kind of government did Turkey have when
                    you arrived there in 1952? Did any changes take place during your first tour in
                    Turkey?</p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: It was something “new” for Turkey. The 1950 general elections in Turkey
                    had been the first, really free and unfettered, democratic elections. The party
                    of Ismet Inonu and his colleagues who had inherited the traditions of Kemal
                    Ataturk was voted out of power. A new party, called the Democrat Party, led by
                    Adnan Menderes, came into power in 1950. When I arrived in Turkey, this new
                    government was still very much in the “bloom” of its success and riding high. Of
                    course, the American government was smiling broadly on this phenomenon of a
                    freely and democratically elected government in the Middle East. The only other
                    such government that the American government could point to was Israel.</p>
                <p>This situation had its pitfalls. Adnan Menderes was very shrewd and quick to
                    exploit this situation. He spread the notion that he was the “chosen instrument”
                    of Washington. We played this game, consciously or unconsciously. The first
                    thing we knew was that Adnan Menderes and his Democratic Party began to abuse
                    their power. The American government was also “tarred with the same brush.” We
                    were regarded as not only condoning but encouraging Menderes to abuse his power.
                    It was that kind of atmosphere.</p>
                <p>Q: You say that Menderes was “abusing his power.” We're talking about the
                    situation during your first tour of duty in Turkey. What did we see as
                    constituting an abuse of power?</p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: There were very strong restrictions on the role of the other
                    parliamentary parties and what they could do. There was a misuse of police
                    power. Tax breaks were accorded to important members of the governing party, the
                    Democrat Party. I can't give you a catalog of these abuses, since I was not
                    assigned to the embassy. Therefore, I was not in the “direct line” of
                    reporting.However, since I was assigned to Istanbul, and Istanbul is really the
                    capital of Turkey in every sense except politically, we would encounter Turkish
                    national, political leaders and other leaders, whose “home base” was Istanbul.
                    They might have been in Parliament or even in the government, and we had a
                    chance to talk to them. Although I was a fairly junior vice consul, I managed to
                    talk to some of these Turkish political figures. Certainly, I heard from our
                    consul general and more senior officers what they were picking up and
                    reporting.</p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>The whole atmosphere was very difficult from the point of view of a “constituent
                    post” under the embassy in Ankara. I'm sure that other people, recalling those
                    years, observed a common phenomenon that the American ambassador and the
                    embassy, in the capital, felt that they had the best vantage point for looking
                    at the government that they were accredited to. They tended to the view that
                    “all of those people out in the provinces” just didn't understand the situation.
                    That was very much a part of the attitude of the American embassy in Ankara
                    toward American officials stationed at the consulate general in Istanbul. For
                    our part we thought that we were living among the “movers and shakers” and that
                    we had a special point of view.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was our ambassador at that time? Were there
                        severaambassadors who served during the time you were in Istanbul?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: There were several. Let's see. When I first came to Turkey, George
                    McGhee was still ambassador. He was a political appointee of the Democratic
                    Party in the U.S. Despite the fact that Dwight Eisenhower won the presidential
                    election of 1952, the Republicans didn't get around to replacing Ambassador
                    McGhee until the late spring of 1953.</p>
                <p>I wouldn't fault Ambassador McGhee for the relatively narrow view taken by the
                    embassy in Ankara, because he used to come to Istanbul often. He kept an
                    apartment in the building of the consulate general, which used to be a combined
                    residence and office when the American embassy was in Constantinople, as
                    Istanbul used to be called. Ambassador McGhee balanced the outlook of the
                    Istanbul metropolis with the views of the relatively “provincial” capital in
                    Ankara. He did this very neatly by often visiting Istanbul himself. He was
                    gracious enough to talk even to the junior officers in the consulate general. He
                    learned their points of view himself. He got to know what our people in the
                    consulate general in Istanbul were hearing and thinking about.</p>
                <p>I would have to say that his successors as ambassador, and the comparison is
                    rather invidious, took a different point of view. His immediate replacement was
                    Averill Warren, God rest his soul, and then Fletcher Warren, and God rest his
                    soul, too. I think that Fletcher Warren was American Ambassador to Turkey for a
                    longer period of time. Fletcher Warren was really a “Latin America” hand. He had
                    been Ambassador to several Latin American countries. He was a very distinguished
                    gentleman. However, I think that he was really “out of his element” in the
                    Middle East. His idea of being an effective ambassador was to give Prime
                    Minister Menderes whatever he wanted, if it was in the power of the United
                    States government. Ambassador Fletcher Warren did not want his “constituent
                    posts” reporting things that reflected against Prime Minister Adnan
                    Menderes.</p>
                <p>Well, we've heard that before. I'm sure that you've interviewed people who served
                    in Iran and who were discouraged from sending in reports which reflected
                    adversely on the Shah.</p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>Q: Oh, yes! Did you feel, even in your position, that you were getting from other
                    reporting officers in Istanbul sort of a feeling that they couldn't report the
                    kinds of things that they wanted to report?</p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: I certainly felt this myself. I'll give you a very specific instance.
                    I'll have to “jump ahead” a little. Q: Could you stick to the 1952-1956 time
                    period?</p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: All right. I'm now jumping ahead to 1955. There had been the so-called
                    “Cyprus riots,” and we can come back to that. However, just to make this point.
                    I had become acquainted with a person whom I considered a rather “elderly”
                    American citizen. He was a naturalized American citizen who lived in Istanbul.
                    He doesn't seem so “elderly” in retrospect. [Laughter] He must have been at
                    least 65 at this time I am speaking of.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: My God, that's old!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: He was married to a granddaughter of Sultan Abdul Hamid. He and the
                    granddaughter lived in sort of “seedy splendor” across the Bosporus Straits in
                    one of those great estates that the Ottoman Princes and Princesses and wives of
                    the Sultans had. He lived right next to one of these estates, which had no
                    heating at all, I must add. It was very uncomfortable to go and visit him and
                    have tea in the wintertime. However, I went, because I was fascinated. Actually,
                    this American citizen's mother-in-law was the last surviving widow of Sultan
                    Abdul Hamid, [the last Turkish Sultan, dead by this time]. He was living in the
                    same building with her son-in-law. However, she never emerged, so I never met
                    this old lady, who really was well on in years. She must have been in her 90s at
                    this time.</p>
                <p>What I'm leading up to is this. One day, in the middle of a snowstorm, at the end
                    of 1955, I guess it was, I had received a telephone call from this
                    Turkish-American. He said that he had something “terribly important” to tell me
                    and that he had to see me right away. He said that he couldn't come to see me at
                    the consulate general because his wife was “indisposed.” He said: “Dan, you've
                    got to come over here. I've got something terribly urgent to tell you.”</p>
                <p>So I went out to see him. From his point of view what he had to tell me WAS
                    terribly urgent, because what he had picked up from the Turkish military
                    garrison right next door to his wife's estate was an open discussion of the
                    beginnings of a plot by the military to overthrow the Adnan Menderes government.
                    I listened to him very carefully. As soon as I got back to the consulate
                    general, I made my notes and drafted a report about what I'd been told and what
                    questions I'd asked my friend. I didn't talk to any of the military attaches
                    assigned to the consulate general. I felt that my Turkish-American friend was
                    pretty astute, and he took this report very seriously, as I did.</p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>I showed this report to the consul general. The consul general looked absolutely
                    terrified. He said: “Well, I think that we'd better send this to the embassy in
                    Ankara. Don't send it to Washington.” So that's what I did. I sent it in the
                    CONFIDENTIAL diplomatic pouch to Ankara, and that's as far as it went. It was
                    never reported to the Department. Then, lo and behold, the Turkish military
                    overthrew the Menderes government. Washington might have had a good two years of
                    lead time to collect additional intelligence on this event, because the report
                    was in such detail. According to my friend, the military officers involved in
                    this coup d'etat talked about their contacts throughout the Turkish military
                    structure. At least this report could have assisted our intelligence people, if
                    no one else, in tracking down what was going on. However, our embassy in Ankara
                    decided to “bury” Dan Newberry's report.</p>
                <p>I was in a position to check out what, if anything, had happened to this report.
                    A few years later I was assigned to the Turkish desk in Washington in NEA
                    [Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs]. I went through the files, and there was no
                    sign that my report had ever reached Washington. That's how I knew that the
                    embassy in Ankara had simply “buried” this report.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was our consul general at this time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: At the time I wrote that report the consul general waRobert McAtee.</p>
                <p>Q: Were reports normally sent directly to Washington from the Consulate General
                    in Istanbul, rather than through the embassy in Ankara?</p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: Yes. Our consuls general, for the most part, exercised their
                    discretion. If I may say so, Mr. McAtee was “retired in place.” He knew that
                    Istanbul was his last post in the Foreign Service and, by his body language and
                    other behavior, he let everybody know that he really didn't want to “trouble the
                    waters.” However, the other consuls general in Istanbul, and I guess that I
                    served under four of them during my four and one-half years in Istanbul,
                    included Burt Matthews, Arthur Richardson, and Bob Miner, who was the last of
                    them.</p>
                <p>These consuls general were all quite insistent on their “right” to report
                    directly to Washington. They “got away” with it, although they had to be
                    somewhat circumspect about this. There was really a “running battle” between the
                    consuls general and the embassy in Ankara. Naturally, the ambassador didn't like
                    such “independent minded” consuls general. Most of the consuls general were very
                    distinguished, senior Foreign Service officers who weren't about to be mere
                    “flunkies.” If they learned something that Washington might not know about, they
                    reported it.</p>
                <p>I'm coming up to a specific case. I mentioned the “Cyprus riots.”This is another
                    case which I will tell you about.</p>

                <p>Q: Before we come to the “Cyprus riots,” how did you handle daily business there
                    in Istanbul, just to give us a “feel” for the atmosphere? You were sent out
                    there to be a “bright-eyed, bushy-tailed” young officer. How did you behave
                    under the circumstances?</p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: All right, if I can “brag” about myself. Q: Sure! It's your
                    microphone.</p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: One of the first things I did, while I was still “getting my bearings”
                    in Istanbul, was that I talked to the chief of the Economic/Commercial Section
                    about this quarterly “Filbert” or “Hazelnut” report. I said: “I can't very well
                    write reports on 'Hazelnuts.' I've never seen a hazelnut bush or tree. I've
                    studied the map, and all of the hazelnuts grow out on the Black Sea [northern]
                    coast of Turkey. I would like to go out there and look at them.” Apparently,
                    nobody had ever bothered to do that before.</p>
                <p>It turned out that there was what they called the “Friday Mail.” This was a
                    coastal boat which left from Istanbul and touched at all of the ports along the
                    Black Sea coast of Turkey. I took along an interpreter from the consulate
                    general, and he and I went on this ship. It was a very picturesque experience.
                    It was my very first time out of Istanbul. I was really getting to see some of
                    the heart of Anatolia.</p>
                <p>For me this trip was just a “ball,” even before I started to report on hazelnuts!
                    So we got off at the port farthest from Istanbul, Trabzon. We went to a local
                    hotel. I think that we paid the equivalent of about $0.50 for our beds. Then we
                    took cross country “jitney taxis” from one place to another. I visited a number
                    of little, hazelnut exporting places along the Black Sea. Of course, hazelnut
                    plants are not just shrubs. They sometimes grow into full size trees. I saw tens
                    of thousands of them and learned a lot about hazelnut cultivation. I talked to
                    the local owners and growers of hazelnuts. In addition to having a wonderful
                    time getting to see part of Turkey, I had a basis for understanding what
                    hazelnut production was all about.</p>
                <p>The reason that all of this was of such interest to the United States government
                    was that the hazelnut or filbert producers in Northern California and Oregon
                    were determined to keep Turkish hazelnuts out of the U.S. market. The U.S.
                    Department of Agriculture constantly wanted updated information on Turkish
                    hazelnut production. There was an elaborate procedure for deciding what the
                    tariffs should be on imported, Turkish hazelnuts. Anyway, I learned about
                    Turkey, and the information which I obtained played right into my hands.</p>
                <p>I remember that one of the “by-words” around the consulate general in Istanbul,
                    because I had so much fun with this, was that people called me the “Attache aux
                    Noisettes.” This was French for calling me the “Hazelnut Attache.” On one
                    occasion someone was visiting my office and said: “Oh, where is Mr. Newberry?”
                    The reply was: “Oh, he's probably gone out to count the hazelnut trees!”
                    [Laughter] Anyway, that was more picturesque, and it did not occupy all that
                    much of my time.</p>
                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>Q: No, but it helped you to get out and see the situation. You can talk much
                    better about it. In fact it represents one of the “dangers” that officers, and
                    particularly economic officers, can get involved in. That is, they may tend to
                    rely on reports that come into the office.</p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: That's right. That's one of the pitfalls you face, and I learned to
                    remind myself to avoid it. The Turks had a superb, research institution in
                    Istanbul called the “Turkish Development Bank.” This bank had some of the best
                    analysts, statisticians, market researchers, and so forth. I could just have
                    gone down to the Turkish Development Bank, obtained a copy of their “handouts,”
                    and written my reports without going anywhere out of Istanbul. This bank turned
                    out really first-rate reports, but that was not what I wanted to do.</p>
                <p>Like many people in the Foreign Service, I very early developed the feeling that
                    I don't like to write about things that I don't understand. This was one of the
                    impelling things about my reporting responsibilities. Before I wrote anything, I
                    wanted to understand it. My way of understanding it was on a “hands on”
                    basis.</p>
                <p>Q: Something that you just mentioned strikes a chord with me. I never served in
                    Turkey, but I've observed it from other places. In particular I have spent about
                    nine years in the Balkans. One thing about Turkey, even in those days, is that
                    it sounds as if the Turks still had this almost “Byzantine” bureaucracy. At the
                    same time they were developing some very bright people. The Turks seem to have
                    gone very well into banking and statistics and were very modern people in this
                    sense. They had a cadre of well-trained people, which is still true today. Did
                    you notice this “dichotomy” between a “Byzantine” bureaucracy and very bright
                    and capable people?</p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: Oh, very much so. Even as an experienced, older officer, I was struck
                    by the irony between the clever way that officials in the Turkish government
                    often behaved and all of these “idiotic” customs regulations which they had
                    adopted. Actually, the Turks had been very far-sighted in sending their bright,
                    young men, and sometimes their bright, young women, off to Europe and the United
                    States for graduate studies and so forth. They had set up, even during Kemal
                    Ataturk's time, and he died in 1938, a program to train people in up to date
                    techniques. So the Turkish government had the resources in terms of personnel
                    and brainpower to do a lot more than their policies allowed them to do.</p>
                <p>When the time came, when it was politically possible to break out of these
                    antiquated and restrictive practices, the trained cadre were in place. So at a
                    certain point in modern Turkish history this process sort of exploded, because
                    the people were ready and willing to do more and, in fact, were even “raring” to
                    do so.</p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>Q: I know that when I was in Athens, in the 1970s, my wife was teaching at a
                    private school. There were several Turkish students in her classes. I think that
                    they were all young women of high school age. My wife was particularly impressed
                    by both the willingness to study and hard work displayed by these Turkish
                    students, as well as their “patriotism.” They wanted to do something for their
                    country. Did you find that this was a very prevalent attitude among the educated
                    classes in Turkey?</p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: Yes, I can say “Amen” to that. Patriotism is something that you find
                    among most Turks. Of course, Kemal Ataturk and the so-called “children of
                    Ataturk” of that generation were raised in that way. The whole “liturgy” of
                    public life really “drove home” the message of Turkish patriotism. However, I
                    found this attitude particularly among the educated women. Over the years of my
                    exposure to Turkish society, I came to understand that modern Turkish women
                    understood that Ataturk's “revolution” is what made it possible for women in
                    Turkey to be something other than bearers of children. Therefore, the Ataturk
                    “revolution” was something to cherish and work for. That was the wellspring of
                    Turkish women's patriotism, which they passed on to their sons and
                    daughters.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about social contacts, in particular? How did you
                        finsocial contacts with the Turks, as a young officer?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: Actually, it was a great blessing to be the lowest ranking officer in
                    the consulate general because I was often not included in the usual,
                    representational functions. I was “free as a bird” most of the time. So I could
                    go out, make new Turkish friends, and spend time with people who had nothing to
                    do with my assigned reporting responsibilities.</p>
                <p>As a consequence, by the time I finished my first tour in Istanbul, I had a very
                    broad range of acquaintances, especially in the cultural field. We'll come to
                    that part of it in a minute. As a consequence, during my last year in Istanbul,
                    I was seconded to USIS [United States Information Service] to be the cultural
                    affairs officer. This assignment was given to me because I had exploited the
                    opportunities available to me. Nobody had been paying attention to what this
                    young vice-consul was doing socially. I hope I didn't use this opportunity
                    inappropriately.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find that the official, social life was almost a
                        form o“entrapment?” This is often a problem at an embassy.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>NEWBERRY: I found what I saw of the official, social life to be tedious in the
                    extreme. It seemed to me that at the senior level social life consisted of most
                    of those 25 or 30 foreign consuls general in Istanbul entertaining one another.
                    I remember reading an economics textbook in college with a chapter called,
                    “Taking in One Another's Washing.” I saw that among the consuls general. I swore
                    that if I ever got to be a Consul General, I would not indulge in that kind of
                    activity. It was very much a “way of life” for people at that level. An awful
                    lot of their time and meager, representational resources were spent entertaining
                    other consuls general.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, how did this business of “taking in each other's
                        washing”work out, as far as the work was concerned?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: I think that one of the most easily detectable effects of it was that
                    senior officers picked up traditional prejudices from one another. Most of the
                    consulates in Istanbul in those days, in the 1950s, still had non-Muslim, local
                    employees. They were often ethnic Greeks, ethnic Armenians, and ethnic Jews who,
                    for various reasons, tended to look down on the Muslim Turks. That attitude had
                    a whole historic and cultural side to it. In this way the consuls general and
                    the foreign staff in the various consulates picked up, and this applied to the
                    American consulate general, too, most of their understanding of what Turks were
                    like, as filtered to them through the eyes and ears of a minority group of
                    non-Turkish employees who worked for them.</p>
                <p>Q: Could you characterize the prevailing attitude of the upper echelon of the
                    officers in the American consulate general and perhaps even of our embassy
                    toward the Turks at this particular time?</p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: I wouldn't want to do an injustice to anybody. I think that the
                    attitude of particularly senior officers varied from person to person. I know,
                    for example, that Bob Miner, who was the last consul general in Istanbul that I
                    served under, really had a great fondness for the Turks. He had taken the
                    trouble, over the years, to learn to speak enough Turkish so that he had a real
                    “feel” for Turkish culture and attitudes. I really don't know about the attitude
                    of the other consuls general in Istanbul. Some of the middle grade officers in
                    the consulate general simply regarded Istanbul as another post in the Foreign
                    Service. Some of us, like myself, found Turkey a very “special” place and the
                    Turkish people a very “special” people. This was just my own prejudice, but I
                    felt that there were all too few Americans who realized what an opportunity it
                    was to be in Turkey and what a remarkable people they were living among.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you talk about the “Cyprus riots,” what they were
                        and whaled up to them?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>NEWBERRY: This may be a little bit out of sequence, but in the mid 1950s the
                    British were indicating to us, as they had done in Palestine, that they wanted
                    to reduce their responsibilities in the Middle East. In Greece they had turned
                    over their responsibilities to us in the late 1940s. They indicated to us in the
                    mid 1950s that they were going to give up Cyprus. So there was a lot of
                    political maneuvering going on. As I look back on the situation in Istanbul, it
                    strikes me that up until 1955, by which time I had been in Turkey for three
                    years, I never heard anything about the subject of Cyprus. Cyprus did not appear
                    to be something that was part of the “liturgy” of Turkish patriotism, and so
                    forth.</p>
                <p>This may only be “hearsay” on my part, and I suppose that the historians have dug
                    into this. There are a lot of Turks today who feel that the British government
                    deliberately aroused the interest of the Turkish Prime Minister and Foreign
                    Minister on the subject of Cyprus to “mitigate” Greek influence on that island.
                    The British have often used the tactic of “divide and conquer.” At least, that
                    is often the Middle Eastern view of British statecraft. These Turks, of whom I
                    speak, think that the reason why the Turks were so stirred up about Cyprus is
                    that the British put them up to it. Of course, by 1955 Turkish Prime Minister
                    Adnan Menderes and his Foreign Minister, Fatim Rustu Zorlu, were desperately
                    looking for “distractions” because the Turkish economy wasn't doing as well as
                    it should. There were pretty good indications that in the next elections they
                    might not even be the majority political party. So the Cyprus issue came to them
                    as an invitation to “stir up the Turkish people,” and that is precisely what
                    they did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you explain what the situation was in Cyprus?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: In 1955? Well, the British were still exercising sovereignty over
                    Cyprus. What they were doing was to look for a way to sort out, not only the
                    Greek and Turkish Cypriot interest on the island but, more importantly, what the
                    governments in Ankara and Athens would have to say about Cyprus.</p>
                <p>While all of this maneuvering was going on, someone set off a bomb in early
                    September, 1955, in the house in Salonika, Greece, where Kemal Ataturk was born.
                    When Ataturk was born there in 1881, Salonika was still part of the Ottoman
                    Empire. In spite of all of the difficulties between Greece and Turkey, the house
                    he was born in had until then been preserved as a kind of “shrine.” Immediately
                    after this incident was reported in Turkey, and the first thing anyone knew,
                    there were anti-Greek mobs in the streets of Istanbul and Izmir. The mobs were
                    protesting against this “outrage.” Then it later turned out that the Turkish
                    government had arranged for the bomb to be thrown against Ataturk's
                    birthplace.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Good God!</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>NEWBERRY: It really was an outrageous, worthless thing for the Turkish government
                    to do. Of course, I was there in Istanbul and I saw the riots developing in
                    Istanbul on September 6, 1955. I saw Turkish government trucks bringing in
                    people from the outlying slums of Istanbul to demonstrate against the Greeks.
                    This could only have been done with the connivance of the Turkish government.
                    The mobs in Istanbul simply went wild, destroying all of the shops in the
                    central part of Istanbul which they imagined to be owned by foreigners. Since
                    most of the foreign shops were owned by non-Muslims, that meant pretty much all
                    of the shops in downtown Istanbul.</p>
                <p>As it turned out, at this time Prime Minister Adnan Menderes and his retinue were
                    on a train, going back to Ankara. It was hours before they could get the news to
                    him that the whole riot in Istanbul and Izmir had gotten out of hand. So it was
                    not until about midnight, as I recall, before the word got back from Prime
                    Minister Menderes. He “blew the whistle” and stopped the riot. The Turkish
                    government sent in the Army with tanks to get the rioters off the streets. So
                    this riot went on from late afternoon on September 6 for six or seven hours.
                    However, the strange thing about all of this was that there was no loss of life!
                    Apparently, the rioters had instructions to destroy only property but not to
                    hurt anybody.</p>
                <p>Now I'm coming up to a point about this business of reporting. Naturally, as soon
                    as the riots were over and we had to pick our way over all of the broken glass
                    around Istanbul, Consul General Arthur Richards deployed all of us to get as
                    much circumstantial, eyewitness material as we could get. He conferred, first of
                    all, with the Greek consul general who naturally had heard many of the “horror
                    stories” about the riots. The Greek consul general assured him that nobody was
                    killed.</p>
                <p>The point I'm leading up to is that as soon as we could get a reporting cable on
                    the riots back to Washington, Consul General Arthur Richards sent it into
                    Washington, with a copy to the embassy in Ankara and a copy to our other
                    Consulates in Turkey. Well, the ambassador in Ankara was furious that the consul
                    general in Istanbul had sent this report directly to Washington. However, Consul
                    General Arthur Richards stood his ground and continued to report directly to
                    Washington. What happened was that, from the ambassador's point of view, about
                    three or four days later he sent one of his second secretaries, a Turkish
                    speaking embassy officer, down to Istanbul to do an “independent” report. The
                    consul general saw what was happening. He called us in and said: “Be courteous
                    to this embassy officer. He's going to cover the same ground that we have, but
                    don't interfere with his reporting. But don't get into any 'who struck John'
                    conversations with him. Let him do his work.” This is what the embassy officer
                    did, but we never saw a copy of his report.</p>
                <p>Q: Were you reporting that these riots had occurred with the connivance of the
                    Turkish government and that trucks were bringing in the rioters from the
                    countryside?</p>
                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>NEWBERRY: I asserted, without really researching the matter, that I had
                    personally seen trucks with the markings of Turkish state enterprises, bringing
                    these people into Istanbul. Although, in the strictest sense, I wasn't taking
                    pictures of the trucks, as it turned out, everybody in Turkey has now
                    acknowledged that the riots were “contrived” and organized by the Turkish
                    government. We reported this, and that's what upset the ambassador in Ankara so
                    much.</p>
                <p>Q: When did it become apparent that the Menderes government had actually arranged
                    to have the bomb set off at Ataturk's birthplace in Salonika?</p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: That became clear much later, although suspicion that this was the case
                    was widely reported. I think that it was several years later before somebody
                    sort of “spilled the beans” and provided circumstantial evidence that the bomb
                    was planted by agents of the Turkish government. That little bit of “clandestine
                    information” took a long time to surface.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why were these called the “Cyprus riots”?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: Because Cyprus was in the atmosphere. Negotiations on Cyprus were going
                    on, and the slogans being “flung about” on the airwaves and newspapers all had
                    to do with Cyprus. The explosion of the bomb that went off at Ataturk's
                    birthplace in Salonika was associated with some sort of slogan having to do with
                    Cyprus, although I would have to research this further. Anyway, everybody
                    understood that the Turks were rioting over Cyprus, and these disturbances have
                    always been referred to as the “Cyprus riots.” On a smaller scale riots were
                    going on in Izmir, too. However, since I wasn't in Izmir, I won't go into
                    that.</p>
                <p>Q: During and prior to these riots in 1955, had there been much in the press
                    about the plight of the poor Turks in Cyprus who were a minority, what the
                    Greeks were allegedly doing to them, and all of that?</p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: No, there was very little material of that kind in the Turkish press.
                    It all just seemed to surface during 1955. Certainly, during my first year in
                    Istanbul [1952], the situation facing the Turks in Cyprus was not something that
                    you heard about. Now, the Turkish minority in Greece was another matter. The
                    Turks were always complaining about them. That's a complicated story, because
                    the Turkish minority in Greece, in Western Thrace, was supposed to be assured of
                    having certain rights by the Treaty of Lausanne, just as the Greek minorities in
                    Turkey were assured of certain rights under the same treaty. Those were the
                    issues that we read about in the press. However, the condition of the Turkish
                    community in Cyprus was just something that never came up in the press.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have much contact with the Greek community in
                        Istanbul?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>NEWBERRY: Very much so. In our Economic-Commercial Section in the consulate
                    general in Istanbul three of our five Foreign Service nationals were ethnic
                    Greeks. Through them I got to meet a lot of people in that community. At that
                    time I made friends with some Americans, art restorers, who were cleaning the
                    mosaics and frescoes at the church of Kariye Camii St. Saviour in Chora, that
                    little jewel of a Byzantine church in Istanbul. Through them I met a lot of
                    other Greek Orthodox people. So I had lots of contacts with the Greeks.</p>
                <p>In those days before the “Cyprus riots” the Greek neighborhoods of Istanbul were
                    among the most interesting places that you could go in the evening. There were
                    Greek “tavernas” where everybody, Greeks and Turks alike, were singing and
                    getting drunk together. There was a wonderful atmosphere there. However, all of
                    that came to an end after the “Cyprus riots.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did that manifest itself?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: First of all, the Turks just stopped patronizing the Greek restaurants,
                    tavernas, and so forth. The ethnic Greeks in Istanbul were obviously beginning
                    to think that maybe they ought to “get out” of Turkey. So Greeks and Turks kept
                    their distance from one another after that, and a lot of Greeks emigrated from
                    Turkey.</p>
                <p>Q: While you were in Istanbul, as this Greek-Turkish distrust became more
                    evident, did you have any “feel” about the political pressure coming from the
                    United States? There is no particular Turkish vote in the U.S., but there sure
                    as hell is a Greek vote in our country. Did you feel any of that at this
                    time?</p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: Not at this time, Stu. I think this whole issue of Greek-American
                    pressure on the U.S. government was a little slow in developing. After all, the
                    British were still the sovereign power in Cyprus, and the status of Cyprus was
                    considered a British, not an American problem. It was only after the British,
                    Greeks, and Turks worked out what were called the “London-Zurich Accords” in
                    1959 or 1960 that there was an occasion or vantage point from which the United
                    States could legitimately be expected to exercise pressure on the Turks. And the
                    pressure came, for sure.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did Turkey become a member of NATO [North Atlantic
                        TreatOrganization]?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: I believe that Turkey was actually voted into NATO at thend of 1951. It
                    may have been December, 1951, or something like that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you arrived in Istanbul...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>NEWBERRY: In March, 1952.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So Turkey was already a member of NATO.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: It was a brand new member, and so was Greece. They werthe two, new
                    members of NATO.</p>
                <p>Q: From your perspective and from what you were hearing at the consulate general
                    in Istanbul, did Turkish entry into NATO make much of a difference?</p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: Oh, very much so. This development certainly got everybody thinking
                    about our relations with Turkey and why Turkey was important. Turkey was now
                    being integrated into the whole scheme of Western defense in the stand against
                    Soviet aggression and so forth. Oh, yes. This made Turkey definitely important.
                    Of course, Turkey had already gained some repute from the behavior of the
                    Turkish Brigade in South Korea during the Korean War. The fact was that the
                    Turks had already shown what they could do on the battlefield in South Korea,
                    where they performed marvelously, of course.</p>
                <p>Everybody seemed to think that the entry of Greece and Turkey into NATO was
                    “great.” The Europeans clearly felt the same way. There were no misgivings,
                    except back in the political capitals of Europe where there were people who
                    didn't want either Greece or Turkey in NATO. However, the admission of Greece
                    and Turkey was due to U.S. pressure. We “twisted arms” to accomplish this. In
                    1951 George McGhee was the Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern and
                    South Asian Affairs. He was generally credited for “masterminding” the whole
                    strategy of bringing Greece and Turkey into NATO. Naturally, when he came out to
                    Turkey to be the American ambassador, he was a “super hero” and is still so
                    regarded by the Turks. Ambassador McGhee, thank God, was still going strong at
                    the time. He went back to Turkey and is still regarded as one of Turkey's
                    favorite Americans!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you view the threat from the Soviet Union against
                        Turkeat that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: I don't think that the fact that we were in Turkey made so much
                    difference as the fact that most Foreign Service officers were convinced that
                    the Soviet Union had “aggressive designs” and that international communism was
                    something that prepared us to take the whole danger of Soviet aggression very
                    seriously. And, of course, the fact that Turkey was geographically that much
                    closer to the Soviet Union only reinforced that view in Turkey.</p>
                <p>However, I knew that most Foreign Service officers in the 1950s had no doubt that
                    the path of wisdom was to stop Soviet aggression before it went any further.</p>

                </p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: It was, in some instances. I should say that it was more on the mind of
                    the Turks than in our minds. The Turkish attitude toward dealing with the Soviet
                    Union was epitomized, in my mind by what a young Turkish diplomat said to me
                    back in the 1950s. This came up in regard to some outrage which the Soviet
                    government had committed, and the American government had given a rather
                    lukewarm response to, in the minds of the Turks. This Turkish diplomat said: “I
                    know that you don't want to use the atom bomb, but give us a bomb, and we'll
                    drop it on the Soviets.” That sort of epitomizes the Turkish attitude in those
                    years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any other developments in Turkey during this
                        1952 t1956 period that come to mind?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: Regarding the period from 1952 to 1956 I can tell you some things that
                    were NOT going on. The Turks were sublimely, if I can misuse this word,
                    oblivious to the rest of the Middle East. The Turks have traditionally disdained
                    the Arabs. They feel that the Arabs “stabbed them in the back” during World War
                    I. They were not particularly interested in their Arab neighbors, except for
                    Iraq. They took great care to stay on speaking terms with Iraq. Apart from that
                    and in retrospect, considering what was going on in the Middle East, the fact
                    that the Turks were so little involved is the reverse of something that
                    happened. It was a “non happening.” Furthermore, at the end of 1956, when the
                    British, French, and Israelis attacked Egypt, this came as a big “thunderbolt”
                    to the Turks. This reminded the Turks that the Middle East was right there,
                    South of Turkey.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're referring to the “Suez Crisis.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: Yes, the Suez Crisis.</p>
                <p>Q: One last question on this. What about the visits to Turkey of ships of the
                    Sixth Fleet of the U.S. Navy? Did you have any such visits to Istanbul, and how
                    did they go?</p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>NEWBERRY: We had many visits by ships of the Sixth Fleet. Of course, the Turks
                    were delighted to have these visits. One of the great things that I have often
                    pointed out is that the most important, single event in the history of
                    U.S.-Turkish relations happened before I arrived in Turkey. It happened in 1946
                    when the battleship, USS MISSOURI, arrived in the port of Istanbul, bearing the
                    remains of the Turkish ambassador to the United States who had died in
                    Washington during World War II. This was the first opportunity to return his
                    remains for burial in his native soil. President Harry Truman saw this as an
                    opportunity to drive a point home to the Soviets, so he chose the most famous
                    battleship in the U.S. Navy and sent the remains of the Turkish ambassador back
                    to Turkey. The Turks understood this symbol very clearly.</p>
                <p>To this day, in 1997, Turks continue to remember just exactly where they were
                    standing when they caught sight of the USS MISSOURI coming into the port of
                    Istanbul. It was like Americans who can remember where they were when they heard
                    about the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941 or when they heard about the
                    assassination of President Kennedy in 1963. Many Turks remember that event in
                    1946. This is a rather long-winded response to your question. However, that was
                    the first ship visit to Turkey. Then, when Turkey became a member of NATO, it
                    became a matter of routine for ships of the Sixth Fleet to visit Istanbul. There
                    were never any problems, nobody demonstrated against these visits, there were no
                    “Yankee, Go Home” meetings, or any of that. The USO [United Services
                    Organization] came out, and the American community rallied around. The Sixth
                    Fleet ship visits were always a great occasion for members of the American
                    community to show their pride.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the problems of the Kurds or the Armenians arise at
                        all, owas that more or less in the bailiwick of the embassy in Ankara?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: Both of those subjects were pretty much “suppressed” in those days. As
                    a matter of fact, the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs during the 1950s, and
                    for many years thereafter, would never acknowledge that there were such people
                    as Kurds in the Republic of Turkey.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They were referred to as “Mountain Turks.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: They were called “Mountain Turks” or simply non Turkish speaking Turks.
                    It was that bad. You simply could not have a discussion with any Turkish
                    government official about the Kurds.</p>
                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>As far as the Armenians were concerned, this was all about a fairly hideous
                    memory of what had happened to the Armenians in 1915 and previously. However,
                    the Armenian community that was left in Turkey was mainly in Istanbul. Of
                    course, the Istanbul Armenians were never subjected to all of that persecution.
                    They may have had relatives who lived in other parts of Turkey and who were
                    driven out of their homes, perished on the road, and so forth. However, I
                    believe that, whether the Turkish government inspired these anti-Armenian
                    actions in eastern Turkey, they never did anything like that in Istanbul. So
                    there was only the memory of the horror and not the direct impressions of it on
                    the part of Armenians living in Istanbul.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the cultivation of hashish, opium poppies, and
                        all othat. Was that an issue at this time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: It was not an issue. We were aware that there was some illegal
                    trafficking, on a localized basis, in opium and opium derivatives. However, now
                    that you ask me about it in this context, I think that the whole issue of the
                    world-wide trafficking in opium and opium derivatives had not developed to such
                    an extent by the early 1950s that Turkey was brought into the controversy.
                    However, the traffic was definitely going on. Of course, the Turkish government
                    had a stake in this traffic because it was getting revenue from the legitimate
                    or licit cultivation of opium for use in legitimate medicines. The opium went
                    into the Turkish government's own factories which were producing authorized
                    “alkaloids.”</p>
                <p>However, the traffic in hashish and opium was not a big, political issue and was
                    not something that the American embassy and consulates had to worry about in the
                    1950s.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left Turkey in 1956. Where did you go next?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: I was transferred to New York. Now that you open up that subject, it
                    gives me a chance to digress again about the personnel assignment system in the
                    Department of State and how different it was in those days. I'll repeat what I
                    may have said before. There was no such thing as “bidding” on positions in
                    Foreign Service posts, as there is now. Since I had spent no time in the
                    Department, I had no idea about how to go about even inquiring about what my
                    next assignment would be.</p>
                <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                <p>However, lo and behold, in the late summer of 1956, I received a letter from a
                    man who had been my supervisory officer in the consulate general in Jerusalem.
                    He had been to a dinner party in Washington where he talked to another Foreign
                    Service officer, Jim Barteau, who had served on the Palestine Conciliation
                    Commission [PCC] and who knew me slightly. Barteau was later the “Number Two” at
                    the U.S. Permanent Mission to the UN [USUN]. Barteau told my former supervisor
                    that they had just established a new position for a second press officer in USUN
                    in New York. Barteau asked my friend and former supervisor if he had any idea of
                    who might be available to fill that slot. So my friend mentioned my name.
                    Barteau said that if I was interested in this position, I should write a letter
                    right away to him at USUN.</p>
                <p>And it all happened just like that. Barteau had a favorable impression toward me
                    from a few encounters we had had, back in Jerusalem, some four or five years
                    earlier. So that's the way the assignment came about. I was assigned to USUN as
                    the junior or second-ranking press officer. This was not a USIS [United States
                    Information Service] slot. It was a State Department slot.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there at USUN from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: I arrived at USUN around the end of August, or early September, 1956. I
                    remember that I reported for duty at USUN on the day that the Suez Canal issue
                    was inscribed on the UN agenda. This was before the British, French, and Israeli
                    invasion of the Suez Canal area.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the Permanent Representative of the American
                        Delegation tthe UN at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: It was Henry Cabot Lodge. His Deputy was Jerry Wadsworth, who had been
                    a Congressman and who was a member of the prominent, Wadsworth family in New
                    York state. His family was very active, politically.</p>
                <p>Q: Let's talk about Henry Cabot Lodge first. He was quite a political figure. He
                    ran for the office of Vice President with Richard Nixon in 1960 and was very
                    much involved in South Vietnam at a later stage. What was your impression of
                    him?</p>
                <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                <p>NEWBERRY: I'll have to qualify my answer by saying that Cabot Lodge was something
                    of a “remote figure” to people on his staff at USUN. We didn't really have
                    occasion to sit down and chat with him, and he was not disposed to chat with us.
                    However, we watched him and supported him. We saw, of course, how he was using
                    his very prominent position. You can imagine that in the very early days of
                    television and television news coverage, with the combination of the Suez Canal
                    crisis and the revolution in Hungary, Henry Cabot Lodge was on television almost
                    every night for weeks and months on end. If he had not been a national figure
                    before that, he certainly was that after the extended “double crisis” of Suez
                    and Hungary in late 1956 and early 1957.I was referring to the television side
                    of this “double crisis.” In those days the whole technology of TV was so
                    under-developed that, when Cabot Lodge was being interviewed on TV, he had to go
                    to the TV studio. The stations didn't have all of these mobile vans and
                    “link-up's” from remote locations. At this time the regular press officer was
                    out of town, so Ambassador Lodge asked me to go with him to the TV studio. I
                    went with him and was just sitting on the sidelines, watching the interview.
                    After it was over, he gave me a ride back to where I lived. He lived in an
                    apartment at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel.</p>
                <p>I said to him: “Mr. Ambassador, you didn't really answer the question they asked
                    you” about this or that subject. He said: “Dan, there's one thing you have to
                    remember about going on TV or being interviewed on TV. You decide ahead of time
                    what YOU want to talk about. You talk about it, no matter what the questions
                    are.” I've never forgotten that. I've seen that, and that's exactly what other,
                    prominent people do. It was good advice, and I learned it early, not that I've
                    done all of that much on TV.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your job at USUN?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: Actually, it was not all press work. The way the U.S. mission was
                    organized, press and public affairs matters were all managed in the same office.
                    I did a lot of what they considered “public appearances” work. In those years we
                    dealt a lot with NGO's, or non-governmental organizations, some of which had
                    permanent, observer missions at the UN. Other groups consisted of
                    public-spirited organizations which would bring visitors to New York, and a
                    visit to the UN was part of their program. A lot of my work involved appearing
                    before these visiting groups and trying to describe how the U.S. mission to the
                    UN was organized and how it represented United States interests. Some of our
                    work involved how we had to “shift gears” during sessions of the UN General
                    Assembly.</p>
                <p>So I had these dual jobs of a public affairs officer, working with public groups,
                    and then assisting the press officer. We had a daily press briefing at noon,
                    every day, during the annual session of the General Assembly in the fall of each
                    year. When other crises were on, we sometimes had daily press briefings.</p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>At this point I have to mention, as an aside, that there was a very attractive
                    young lady, who was in the UN Bureau of the daily newspaper, The Christian
                    Science Monitor. She used to come to these press briefings and sat in the first
                    row. She used to ask questions. Finally, one day, I asked her a question, and
                    she said: “Yes!” [Laughter] She became my wife.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You arrived at USUN at quite a hot time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: Indeed.</p>
                <p>Q: We're talking about the impact of the double crisis of the Suez Canal issue
                    and the Hungarian revolt in October-November, 1956. What was your impression of
                    what we were doing and what were some of the issues that we had to deal
                    with?</p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: As far as the Suez crisis was concerned, I think that everybody in USUN
                    supported President Eisenhower. It was a “bitter pill” for our British and
                    French allies to follow the lead of U.S. policy on this matter. I think that in
                    this regard there was very little dissent among the Americans on our mission
                    staff. They felt that Eisenhower did absolutely the right thing to “blow the
                    whistle” on the British, the French, and the Israelis. It was very difficult to
                    restore what had been very cordial working relations with the British, the
                    French, and some of the other European and NATO allies and delegations at the
                    UN. So a “chill” developed between us on this matter. However, eventually, this
                    all settled down, and the British decided, and the British body politic in
                    particular probably decided, that Eisenhower was right, and Sir Anthony Eden
                    [British Prime Minister at the time] was wrong.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the Hungarian revolt? Were you involved at all
                        ithat?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: Oh, yes. Everybody in our mission was involved, especially the two
                    press officers, because we had hours-long sessions, sometimes with both issues
                    being debated back and forth. I remember that, on one occasion, I was in the UN
                    building continuously for about 38 hours, without getting out of there. It was
                    that kind of intense, prolonged, protracted work pressure. But it was
                    fascinating, and we were all gripped by it. Fortunately, there were snack bars
                    at the UN where we could get something to eat, both day and night. So we didn't
                    die of hunger!</p>
                <p>On Hungary, first of all, there was the “trauma” of it. Even then, some of us had
                    a sneaking suspicion, and we used to mumble this to ourselves, that maybe we had
                    “misled” the Hungarians to expect too much from the U.S. That was one element.
                    However, we were so busy that we didn't really spell it all out.</p>
                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>When I mention the trauma, I remember one particular moment, when the Soviet Army
                    moved into Budapest. At a certain point the Associated Press ticker at the
                    United Nations was “hooked into” the Associated Press Bureau in Budapest. Then I
                    discovered what was going on. I was looking at the “Telex” machine as this
                    material was coming in, with “blow by blow” descriptions from the AP office in
                    Budapest, reporting what was happening. One report said that Soviet soldiers
                    were downstairs in the AP building and were coming up the stairs. And then, all
                    of a sudden, this report stopped. It still gives me the “creeps” to recall this.
                    We had been that close to the event. It was almost as if we were talking to the
                    AP staff. So it was a very dramatic time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were assistant press officer of the mission from 1956
                        to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: I was there from 1956 to 1958.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the journalists in the press
                        corpwith whom you were working?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: It was a very large press corps. There were some very good journalists
                    and some who were not so good. Most of the wire services had first rate people
                    covering the UN. One of the reporters whom I felt privileged to have known was a
                    real “pioneer” in journalism, Pauline Frederick. She was the first, really
                    prominent woman television reporter. She was covering the UN full time. I had
                    many occasions to have really “in depth” conversations with her. I probably
                    learned more from her than she learned from me.</p>
                <p>There were a lot of journalists of that caliber. I think that some of the major
                    U.S. newspapers like the bureau of The New York Times at the UN had at least
                    four, full time people covering the UN. The “Herald-Tribune” had two or three
                    full time people at the UN. Even The New York Daily News had three, full time
                    reporters, even though they didn't carry much material on the UN in that
                    paper.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The New York Daily News is a tabloid.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: A tabloid, and I used to wonder how in the world they could justify
                    having three people assigned to the UN. You check the clippings of articles in
                    the “News” on the UN, and there probably wouldn't be more than four or five
                    column inches per day. But the “News” maintained a fairly large staff at the
                    UN.</p>
                <pb facs="0060" n="Page0060"/>
                <p>Anyway, there were a lot of first rate reporters assigned to the UN and a lot of
                    attention paid to everything that was going on there. If you'll pardon the
                    expression, some of the “provincial” newspapers, like The St. Louis
                    Post-Dispatch and The Chicago Sun-Times both had full time reporters covering
                    the UN. They covered nothing but the UN. So it was a very stimulating
                    environment for me to work in, apart from being the press officer for the U.S.
                    Mission to the UN.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did an “anti-UN” lobby develop in the United States at
                        that timwhich you had to deal with?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: We at the mission had little occasion to deal with it. We were aware of
                    some of the sentiments, but I'll tell you that, in our perspective, and my own
                    perspective as well, we were not particularly concerned about it. Mind you, we
                    were working under a Republican administration. Some of what I might call the
                    more ardent conservatives in the mission referred somewhat cynically to what
                    they called, the “cult of the UN.” This term about the “cult of the UN” referred
                    to people who often made the point that the United Nations is our “one, last
                    hope for peace” and that we have to support everything that the UN is trying to
                    do.</p>
                <p>Some of us felt that this attitude was going too far, because we saw the
                    limitations of the UN and appreciated at first hand what the UN could and could
                    not do. However, we didn't feel any direct impact from what the “anti-UN people”
                    were saying and doing. In a way, I used to blame what we used to call the “cult
                    of the UN” for raising the expectations of the American public regarding what
                    the UN could do.</p>

                        time yowere there in USUN?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: Yes. Actually, I only served in USUN for two years. I think that Lodge
                    was there until he resigned to run for Vice President in 1960.</p>
                <p>Q: What was your impression of some of the other delegations at the UN?</p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: Well, mine was a very narrow perspective. In spite of the rather chilly
                    relations we had with the British mission to the UN after the Suez Crisis in
                    1956, I felt that they were very well equipped and represented. Some of the
                    smaller countries had very good people there. For example, the Danes, although
                    they had a very small mission, really paid a lot of attention to what was going
                    on. The same thing was true of the Swedes. Of course, Dag Hammarskjold of Sweden
                    was the Secretary General of the UN, and it was not surprising that the Swedes
                    would pay a lot of attention to the organization.</p>
                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>I didn't have that much contact with the other delegations, except for the
                    Turkish delegation, since I had served so much time in Turkey. I was
                    “befriended” by the Turkish mission and was very glad to be so treated. I
                    learned something about the Turkish perspective, but I can't say that the
                    Turkish Delegation to the UN was all that influential. This was just a personal
                    interest of mine.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were relations like between the U.S. and Israel
                        within the Ucontext at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: Once we got past the Suez crisis of 1956-57 and things “settled down,”
                    the “status quo ante” in our relations was restored, and the importance of
                    Israel in the American foreign policy process came very much to the fore. We had
                    very close contacts with the Israeli UN Mission. In those days the Israelis sent
                    some of their top diplomats to head their mission at the UN. I think that any of
                    us in the Foreign Service who had been “saturated” with the influence of Zionist
                    and other friends of Israel on the formulation and conduct of American foreign
                    policy did not need to be reminded of it. The evidence of it was there, every
                    day.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the Soviet Union and the other countries of the
                        Soviebloc? Was there much contact with them at this point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: I would say, in general, that it was sort of an “operational contact.”
                    We would be in touch with the Soviets in getting co-sponsors for resolutions in
                    the General Assembly or in the Security Council. There was a certain amount of
                    “collegial contact” with the Soviet delegation. However, our objectives and
                    purposes were so much opposed to one another that there was not all that much
                    contact. That is, unless our “clandestine people” were making contact with the
                    Soviets, and we didn't know about it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you work with the press? Did you go out to them
                        with aagenda, and they would come in with an agenda? How did this work
                        out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: In general, the way that my boss, Frank Carpenter, and I operated, once
                    we were briefed on the situation and read the morning “take” of telegrams, which
                    the mission to the UN circulated to us, we would contact other delegations and
                    the UN Secretariat to find out what was going on. Other delegations certainly
                    didn't hesitate to ask us what we thought about given issues. I remember one
                    particularly aggressive guy who would call me at home on the weekends and even
                    on Sunday morning, because he was “on duty.” In general, the press did not let
                    us escape knowing what questions they were interested in. So when it came time
                    for the formal and principal briefings, we had a pretty good idea of what the
                    press people were going to ask.</p>
                <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                <p>Q: Was there any difference between the questions asked by TV and press
                    representatives in those days, as far as approach and that sort of thing?</p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: I don't think so. Most of the TV reporters, like John McVane and
                    Pauline Fredericks had come to their jobs after working for the “print media.”
                    It seemed to me that their style of operating was very much like that of the
                    other journalists who worked for the “wire services” and the major, metropolitan
                    newspapers. They also had “deadlines” to meet. The Baltimore Sun had a full-time
                    reporter at the UN.</p>
                <p>Q: What about your “backstopping” from the State Department? I mean from the
                    Bureau of International Organizations Affairs [the IO Bureau]? Did you feel the
                    “heavy hand” of the IO Bureau or not?</p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: Not as much as IO would like to have been able to do. Ambassador Henry
                    Cabot Lodge saw to that! Cabot Lodge was a member of the President's cabinet,
                    and he reminded the people in IO that they were dealing with a cabinet officer.
                    That sort of kept the IO people “at bay.” However, on the operational level we
                    found ways, without affronting Ambassador Lodge or anybody else, of keeping in
                    touch with IO.</p>
                <p>As I was about to say, we at the working level had our own telephone lines to the
                    State Department, and particularly to the Bureau of International Organization
                    Affairs. We found ways of coordinating our views in the manner that we needed,
                    without getting into a “turf battle” between the Assistant Secretary for IO and
                    Ambassador Lodge at the UN.</p>
                <p>Q: You were there at USUN until 1958. That was after the Suez and the Hungarian
                    crises were over. Was there anything else that particularly occupied your time
                    at the UN?</p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: Toward the end of my time in USUN and in the summer of 1958 “all hell
                    broke loose” in Baghdad, Iraq. Nuri Said, the Prime Minister; Crown Prince
                    Illah, the Prince Regent; and King Faisal were all hanged after a coup d'etat,
                    which overthrew the Iraqi government.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're talking about the coup which occurred on July 14,
                        1958.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: That was a very dramatic event which attracted our attention at the UN.
                    That kept all of us at USUN “chasing around,” during my closing weeks in New
                    York. I was transferred to Washington at the end of that summer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the general reaction in the Department to the
                        coup? Did we do anything? Were there any elements of concern about this
                        event in Baghdad?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                <p>NEWBERRY: First of all, there was astonishment that it had happened. As with most
                    of these events in the Middle East, the Soviets were always “rattling” their
                    missiles and so forth. This was always a backdrop to the event. Whoever was in
                    charge in the Soviet Union would say: “If you don't do this, that, or the other,
                    we'll fire missiles which will rain down on you.” That was always part of the
                    problem which made everybody, shall we say, more “uptight” than would otherwise
                    have been the case.</p>
                <p>Q: What about President Eisenhower sending our troops into Lebanon because of
                    this whole crisis in the Middle East? Did that cause any flurry in the UN?</p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: I think it only caused a flurry among people who had served in the
                    Middle East. Some of us thought that this deployment of U.S. troops was
                    unnecessary. However, I wouldn't say that there were extended discussions on the
                    matter. I personally thought that the situation in Lebanon was such that we
                    didn't have to send troops there. You may recall that when the U.S. troops
                    landed, they were welcomed by the Lebanese people. However, that's another story
                    for somebody else's book.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then in the late summer of 1958 you went back to
                        Washington.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: To serve on the Turkish desk.</p>

                <p>Q: Today is December 16, 1997. Dan, we have you coming back to the Turkish desk
                    in the late summer of 1958. You were on the Turkish desk from when to when?</p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: I don't remember the exact dates, but it was from the latsummer of 1958
                    until November, 1959.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the Turkish desk fit into the Bureau of Near
                        EasterAffairs at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: Turkey was one of three countries in an organization called the Office
                    of Greek, Turkish, and Iranian Affairs, also known by the acronym of “GTI.”
                    Although Cyprus was beginning to be treated as a separate entity, I recall that
                    Archer Blood was working in GTI. He later went on to greater glory. Cleo Noel
                    was working on Cyprus, and Grad Mawser was working on Iran. The Turkish desk was
                    larger in those days, so I had an officer senior to me as the officer in charge
                    of Turkish Affairs, Guy Hope. I was the number two officer on the Turkish desk.
                    We worked under the general direction of the office director for Greek, Turkish,
                    and Iranian Affairs, Owen Jones.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During the 1958-1959 period what were the major issues
                        that yofound yourself dealing with on the Turkish desk?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: The major subject that I recall, and I'm sure that I dealt with many
                    others, was the whole set of problems associated with the growing, American
                    military presence in Turkey. The Pentagon, the State Department, and other U.S.
                    government agencies found that it was very convenient for us to have an “open
                    door” in Turkey. The Prime Minister of Turkey was very glad to have his country
                    seen as a “chosen instrument” of the United States.</p>
                <p>I remember vividly, I must say, and on my own initiative, since I had seen the
                    signs of this tendency before I left Turkey in 1956, that I prepared a paper
                    pointing to the dangers of the growing American military presence in Turkey. The
                    number of American military personnel in Turkey was approaching 10,000. I
                    thought that a presence of this size was full of potential trouble and was
                    already beginning to reflect such trouble. This was in terms of the inevitable
                    collisions of American servicemen with Turkish traditions, institutions, and
                    traffic. The American presence in Turkey was beginning to be a big, big
                    problem.</p>
                <p>This was a time when the NATO “Status of Forces” agreement was being negotiated
                    with Turkey. The application of a “Status of Forces” agreement standard allowed
                    the American military to “declare” an incident involving an infraction of
                    Turkish law as being committed while the American serviceman involved was “on
                    duty,” in which case it was beyond the reach of the Turkish courts. This was
                    already giving us a lot of problems and was going to create even bigger problems
                    later on.</p>
                <p>I recall that this was the main problem that I worked on. Of course, I worked on
                    other subjects. There was the growing, political dissension and the exasperation
                    of the Turkish body politic with the regime of Prime Minister Adnan Menderes. It
                    became more and more repressive, putting restrictions on opposition parties,
                    which I alluded to in an earlier part of this oral history. There were signs
                    that the Turkish military was plotting to get rid of the Adnan Menderes regime.
                    Lo and behold, the Turkish military did just that, shortly after I left the
                    Turkish desk early in 1960.</p>
                <p>Q: Going back to the American presence in Turkey, did you have any contact with
                    people at the Pentagon on this matter, or did you have any discussion with your
                    superiors on this issue?</p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: No. There were discussions on this subject, but I was not directly
                    involved in them. My immediate superior, Guy Hope, and his superiors had their
                    own liaison arrangements with the Pentagon. That was just not one of the things
                    that they assigned to me to handle.</p>
                <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                <p>A great deal of this liaison was handled in the field between the American
                    embassy and the MAG [Military Advisory Group] or, as they called it in Turkey,
                    the JUSMAT [Joint United States Military Advisory Group in Turkey], as well as
                    the U.S. Air Force in Turkey. This was a very “stormy” relationship. At one
                    point, in 1959, I found myself on a visit to Turkey, right in the middle of a
                    big investigation of a currency scandal, involving a full colonel in the U.S.
                    Air Force and a lot of people on his staff. The American military in Izmir were
                    caught “red handed” in large scale, black marketing of American currency. In
                    short, we had a huge array of problems, on which the American military was not
                    very sympathetic with the State Department.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it part of your job to monitor the problem of the
                        Americapresence in Turkey?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: Very much so. We were in contact, either by telegram or by letter
                    transmitted by pouch. The embassy and the consulates knew very well that the
                    Turkish desk back in Washington was very much aware of these problems and
                    welcomed more alert and detailed reporting on this matter. We always commended
                    the embassy and the consulates for what they were doing in this respect. One of
                    the “stranger” duties of the junior officer on the Turkish desk was to write
                    evaluations of reports from the field. These evaluations, by the way, were
                    signed by my superior officers, but everybody knew that Dan Newberry was writing
                    them. I'm proud to say that, despite the fact that I “chided” some of the
                    drafting officers for “overlooking” some things, they are still my friends
                    today.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the political situation in Turkey? You say that
                        thcoup d'etat which overthrew the Menderes government happened...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: On May 19, 1960. I left the Turkish desk in December, 1959.</p>
                <p>Q: Were you getting reports on the situation within the Turkish Army, and were
                    you on the “alert” that this coup d'etat was brewing? You mentioned before that
                    in the embassy in Ankara there was a tendency to “pooh-pooh” such reports.</p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: Well, the indications of a possible coup got worse.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you talk about the situation and how you saw it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                <p>NEWBERRY: Yes. How I saw it and how my colleagues saw it, because we used to
                    wring our hands and mutter about it among ourselves. Although there were plenty
                    of signs of unrest in the Turkish Army, even reports to this effect in the
                    Turkish press, insofar as the newspapers would dare to print such material and
                    risk having the papers closed down. The level of discontent was rising. There
                    were even demonstrations here and there against what the press considered
                    repression by the Adnan Menderes party, even before I left the Turkish desk.</p>
                <p>However, Ambassador Fletcher Warren in Ankara was a very capable Foreign Service
                    officer. He is now dead. He lived to a great age, well into his 90s, in Texas.
                    Fletcher Warren considered that America's interest in Turkey would be best
                    served by preserving Adnan Menderes in power as Prime Minister. He simply did
                    not encourage any adverse or, shall I say, disparaging reports on the state of
                    Adnan Menderes' government. Some of these disparaging reports managed to be sent
                    to the Department of State, one way or another, but basically his approach to
                    Washington was to protect the reputation of Adnan Menderes. I would say that,
                    although I'm jumping ahead of this story, people who have studied modern Turkish
                    history know that eventually the military, revolutionary government which
                    overthrew Menderes sent him to the gallows. He was hanged.</p>
                <p>Fletcher Warren still tried his best, right up until the end of the whole drama,
                    to save Adnan Menderes, because he considered that Menderes had been such a good
                    friend of the United States.</p>
                <p>Q: What view was taken of the reports coming into the Department from Ambassador
                    Warren and from other parts of our embassy, as well as the analysis that we were
                    getting? Was it apparent in Washington that there was a real, “split view” of
                    how things were going in Turkey?</p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: It was evident to me, mainly from talking to people senior to me. I was
                    not privy to a lot of the highly classified traffic, so I don't know actually
                    what went on. I have forgotten what my rank was at the time. Even though I had
                    been in the Foreign Service for nine or 10 years, I looked much younger than
                    that. People tended to treat me as a junior officer, even though I had nearly 10
                    years of experience. However, I wasn't “cut in” on a lot of the reporting.</p>
                <p>Q: When you talk about highly classified telegrams, I was thinking that this
                    usually means at the ambassadorial level, or something like that.</p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: I'm only guessing, Stu. Since I didn't see these cables twhich I refer,
                    maybe they didn't really exist.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the Director of the Office of GTI Affairs, and who
                        was thAssistant Secretary for the Near East?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0067" n="Page0067"/>
                <p>NEWBERRY: In charge of GTI was Owen Jones, whom I referred to before. Owen Jones
                    had an excellent background. He had served in Ankara as the Economic Counselor
                    in the fairly recent past. He knew the situation and knew Ambassador Warren, who
                    was out there in Ankara. So Owen Jones was about as good a choice as we could
                    have to be the Director of GTI in that situation. His deputy was Millau
                    Williams, who had previously served in Greece. Williams went on to be an
                    ambassador in Central America. He, too, is now dead.</p>
                <p>Above the Office of GTI the Assistant Secretary was William Rountree. The Deputy
                    Assistant Secretary with whom I dealt most was “Pete” Hart, or Parker T. Hart,
                    who is very well known and well considered in the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you feel that Owen Jones shared your concerns about
                        Mendereand company?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: I think so. At least that's my recollection. However, given the way
                    that the State Department was organized in those days, an FSO-1 [high rank]
                    didn't spend all that much time talking to an FSO-5 [more junior officer]. Owen
                    Jones was a busy man, and he had Greece, Iran, and Cyprus to deal with, as well
                    as a lot of other people to talk to. I don't begrudge him that. I admired him,
                    and he's still a great friend of mine but I didn't spend all that much time
                    talking with him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Dan, while you were on the Turkish desk, did you run
                        across th“Greek Lobby” at all, during this 1958-1959 period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: I knew that it was there but I think that they had not “geared up” as
                    well as they obviously did later on. It had not yet become a major feature of
                    the Washington scene, but it was very much there.</p>
                <p>Let me remind you that the British were still governing Cyprus at this time.
                    There was a time when I was on the Turkish desk when the Turks had that
                    horrible, airplane crash. Adnan Menderes and his whole retinue were on the
                    plane, and several people were killed. They were on their way to discuss the
                    Cyprus problem with the Greeks and the British. So that is another reason why I
                    think, in retrospect, that the Greek Lobby in American politics had not yet
                    become a major factor. Cyprus was still a British possession.</p>
                <p>Q: What about the Turkish attitude toward NATO and, more particularly, toward the
                    Soviet Union? Were we at all concerned that the Turks might try to do business
                    with the Soviets or not?</p>
                <pb facs="0068" n="Page0068"/>
                <p>NEWBERRY: Absolutely not. On the contrary, the Turks have the reputation of being
                    our “staunchest ally.” Regarding NATO, the Turks wanted more NATO infrastructure
                    projects, and they got a lot of them. The defense of Turkey's eastern border
                    with the Soviet Union was consciously strengthened by the Turks and by NATO. Our
                    relations with Turkey, in the NATO context, were very productive during the
                    years I served in Turkey. After the coup d'etat of 1960 a lot of questions began
                    to be asked, but this is jumping ahead of the story, and I was off the Turkish
                    desk by that time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have the feeling that Turkey still played a
                        secondary rolin American policy in the Near East at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: Yes, very definitely. We felt in many ways that whenever Turkish
                    cabinet ministers came to Washington, it was always a struggle to make sure that
                    they got in to see the “right people.” Of course, the Turkish desk was not the
                    only desk that had that problem.</p>
                <p>Q: Did you also find that within the Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs Turkey was a
                    country of “secondary interest,” as compared to Israel, Egypt, and Saudi
                    Arabia?</p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: Oh, not at all. Turkey was one of the leading countries in NEA [Bureau
                    of Near Eastern Affairs] which, in those days, included South Asia and Africa.
                    It was a big bureau, but Turkey was regarded as at least as important as Egypt,
                    but not as important as Israel. Israel has always had a very special place in
                    the American foreign policy scheme of things. Nobody had any illusions about
                    what was the “number one” country in NEA.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left the Turkish desk in 1959. Then where did you
                        go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: It turned out to be quite an adventure, for all sorts of reasons. With
                    respect to my own, professional future, as I mentioned a while ago, I was
                    concerned about still being treated as a “junior officer.” By now I had been in
                    the Foreign Service for 10 years. I was looking for a way of getting a more
                    substantial position. Instead, I got something quite different from what I had
                    bargained for. I had let it be known that I was looking for another job.</p>
                <p>I had just taken time out to attend Pratt Summer School at McGill University [in
                    Canada] to study French. So I was newly certified as being fairly fluent in
                    French. Somebody in Personnel had heard about this. He had a “desperate vacancy”
                    in Vientiane, Laos. The ambassador there had been sending “NIACT” [Night Action]
                    telegrams about this vacancy. Before I knew it and before I could even “check
                    out” the situation, I was “in the pipeline” to go to Laos.</p>
                <pb facs="0069" n="Page0069"/>
                <p>Meanwhile, my courtship with the lady up in New York had been proceeding. The
                    assignment to Laos precipitated a decision for us to get married right away. So
                    our wedding date was set for December 3, 1959. After our wedding we took a
                    15,000 mile wedding trip from Asheville, North Carolina, to Vientiane, Laos!</p>
                <p>This next assignment to the embassy in Vientiane was an adventure imany ways.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in Laos from 1960 until when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: From December, 1959, until December, 1961. For reasons which we can
                    review, I got out of Vientiane precisely on the second anniversary of my arrival
                    there. I was plenty ready to leave.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was ambassador when you went to Vientiane?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: The ambassador who had been there for some time and who was so
                    insistent about getting another French-speaking officer out there was Horace
                    Harrison Smith. He was a “Far East hand” and was fairly well known in the
                    Foreign Service in those days. About six months after I arrived in Vientiane,
                    Ambassador Smith was replaced by Ambassador Winthrop Brown, who arrived in Laos
                    in early summer, 1960. He was still ambassador when I left Laos in 1961. Then
                    Ambassador Brown went on to be ambassador to the Republic of Korea and, I think,
                    Deputy Assistant Secretary for East Asian Affairs.</p>
                <p>I don't want to distract the reader or the transcriber of this memoiwith too many
                    personal reminiscences.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, let's see what you have to say.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: It will become evident, if it is not already so, that I admired
                    Ambassador Winthrop Brown and that I did not admire Ambassador Horace Smith.</p>
                <p>Q: Let's talk about the situation in Laos when you arrived there iDecember, 1959.
                    This was a time when the situation in Laos was beginning to “heat up,” and Laos
                    became a significant center of public attention.</p>
                <pb facs="0070" n="Page0070"/>
                <p>NEWBERRY: Well, not quite. The whole of the former Indochina was receiving
                    attention, but Laos was still a little known corner of Indochina. In fact, many
                    people at our wedding had to ask me where Laos was on the map and what was this
                    place called “Vientiane.” They would ask: “Don't you mean 'Vietnam?'” This was a
                    fairly sophisticated community in Asheville, North Carolina. However, a lot of
                    the people we met didn't even know where Vientiane, Laos, was!</p>
                <p>Anyway, what I intended to say was that, when I arrived in Vientiane, after all
                    of those “NIACT” telegrams the ambassador had sent to the Department about
                    filling my position, I found that the ambassador was going to put me to work
                    doing something other than what he had been screaming about in those telegrams.
                    In fact, the embassy initially didn't even have a desk for me! Anyhow, I figured
                    that I “lucked out,” because these telegrams precipitated the lady's decision to
                    marry me and to go with me to Indochina. I was happy, no matter what the job
                    was.</p>
                <p>As far as the political situation was and the place of Laos in the world, these
                    were still a puzzle to me and to most of the Americans in our embassy there, who
                    were not “in the know.” There was a “huge” CIA [Central Intelligence Agency]
                    component there. They far outnumbered the State Department people, and I was
                    about to say the AID [Agency for International Development] mission. It was the
                    most blatantly open, “clandestine” operation I have ever seen. Everybody in Laos
                    knew who many of the CIA operatives were, and the CIA people didn't make any
                    attempt to disguise their affiliation.</p>
                <p>As a matter of fact, there was a very colorful, picturesque CIA man in Vientiane
                    whose name was Campbell James. He was famous among CIA veterans of those days.
                    The way the newly arrived CIA people identified themselves to the Lao was by
                    asking the question: “Do you know my friend, Campbell James?” That was a way of
                    announcing that they worked for the CIA and that the Lao could deal with them
                    accordingly.</p>
                <p>Then we had a “disguised,” military aid mission. Under the terms of the 1954
                    Geneva Accords, there was not supposed to be anything like a military aid
                    mission in Laos. We had something called the “PEO,” or the “Program Evaluation
                    Organization.” Every one of the men assigned to the PEO dressed alike in sort of
                    British-looking, white tropical shirts, shorts, knee length stockings, and white
                    shoes. They all stood to attention when they talked to one another. There was a
                    Major General, Johnny Heintges (John Arnold Heintges), who was in charge of this
                    group. Instead of calling him “General,” everybody called him “Chief.” Again,
                    this was a very thinly disguised MAAG [Military Assistance and Advisory Group]
                    mission in Laos. It was a very bizarre situation that my wife and I moved into
                    when we arrived in Vientiane at the end of 1959.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, what was happening in Laos? Why was all of this
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0071" n="Page0071"/>
                <p>NEWBERRY: There was a communist-inspired insurgency, called the “Pathet Lao,”
                    which controlled a good bit of the country. They were very aggressive. As far as
                    we understood it, the Chinese Communists and the Soviet Union were giving the
                    Pathet Lao aid and comfort. Meanwhile, the country was still ostensibly governed
                    by the King of Laos, whose residence was in Luang Prabang [some 120 miles North
                    of Vientiane] and who was a remote figure. However, the real leaders were other
                    Princes from the royal family.</p>
                <p>Prince Souvanna Phouma was the Prime Minister. His half brother, another member
                    of the royal family, was Prince Souphannouvong, who had associated himself with
                    the communists years before. He was a communist prot�g�. Prince Souvanna Phouma
                    and Prince Souphannouvong were openly contesting with each other for power,
                    supported by their sponsors: the French and the Americans, in the case of
                    Souvanna Phouma, and the North Vietnamese, the Chinese Communists, and the
                    Soviet Union, in the case of Souphannouvong.</p>
                <p>I'm not sure that anybody understood what we were trying to do in Laos. It was
                    certainly never conveyed to us by the ambassador and the “Country Team”
                    [ambassador's senior advisers]. In addition, there were hundreds and even
                    thousands of American officials, milling around and “doing their own thing,”
                    without very much coordination.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your job in the embassy in Vientiane?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: I was assigned there to be a liaison officer between the embassy and
                    the thinly-disguised MAAG mission, but the ambassador realized that it was a
                    waste of effort to have a French-speaking officer dealing with Americans. The
                    embassy replaced me with a Thai-speaking officer, who did liaison work with the
                    American military! I became the second-ranking officer in the Political Section.
                    My assigned duty was to cover the Lao National Assembly, which passed for a
                    Parliament. However, I found that there were three or four CIA officers who were
                    doing the same thing I was doing, and with more resources at their disposal than
                    I had. So it was an uphill struggle.</p>
                <p>Q: When you say this, in the first place, was the Lao National Assembly an
                    effective, political organ, or was this just a sort of “show piece”?</p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: It was more of a “show piece” than otherwise. Just to give you an
                    example of how well-equipped the members of the National Assembly, the deputies,
                    were, all of the legislation introduced into the Lao National Assembly was
                    drafted in French by French bureaucrats seconded to the Lao government and
                    ultimately translated into Lao. The debates in the National Assembly were in
                    French, and then they were translated into Lao before they were published. This
                    gives you a pretty good idea of who was doing the “technical work” of the
                    National Assembly.</p>
                <pb facs="0072" n="Page0072"/>
                <p>I hesitate to say that French advisers were “calling the shots,” because there
                    were real shots being fired before long. However, French officials were still
                    very much in control of the situation and also in the Ministry of Foreign
                    Affairs. We in the American embassy dealt openly with French bureaucrats, who
                    were telling Lao officials how to conduct the foreign affairs of Laos.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then, in a way, your most effective work involved dealing
                        witFrench officials who were working for the Lao?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: Yes. That was certainly the most satisfying aspect of my work to me
                    because I had very intelligent conversations with these French officials.</p>
                <p>I would like to get back to this other point, about the competition with CIA
                    officers. A very vivid episode comes to mind. When the situation was much
                    “tenser,” later on, I had a conversation with Chao Somsanith, who was the
                    President of the Lao National Assembly. In other words, he was the Speaker of
                    the National Assembly. This was at a time when it looked as if the Pathet Lao
                    were going to take over the coalition government, or some such thing. I thought
                    that Somsanith, the President of the National Assembly, expressed some very
                    interesting views, contrary to what his own colleagues had been telling our
                    ambassador. So I reported all of this, and the ambassador sent this report to
                    the Department of State. He said that he had no idea that Prince Somsanith was
                    an “independent thinker.”</p>
                <p>The next day one of these CIA officers went around and had another talk with the
                    same man, Chao Somsanith, and sent out a completely contradictory telegram
                    through his own channels to Washington. I didn't find out about this, and
                    neither did the ambassador, until several days later. What the people in
                    Washington made out of the President of the National Assembly talking out of
                    both sides of his mouth to different American officials and why he did so, I
                    leave it to you and to our readers to conjecture.</p>
                <p>Q: Were you sort of “tripping over” the CIA people? Laos is a small country, and
                    if the CIA had three people covering the same ground that you were covering, I
                    would have thought that there would have been a “traffic control problem.”</p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: Well, they had their own communications system.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was thinking of “traffic” in the sense of going in and
                        out othese offices.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0073" n="Page0073"/>
                <p>NEWBERRY: Or the embassy parking lot. Sometimes this was a problem in itself. To
                    say that we had problems is another way of saying that we were just trying to
                    make our way through the congestion. There were several conspicuous and, shall I
                    say, ubiquitous figures involved. I sometimes had this figure of speech in my
                    mind. We in the State Department, Foreign Service officers, were like the
                    “gigolos” at a tremendous house party. We were keeping the guests entertained,
                    while the “second story men” were upstairs doing our work. That is the feeling I
                    had as an embassy officer in the midst of all of this so-called “clandestine
                    activity,” which was so much more extensive than our own, official activity.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the communist threat where you
                        were iLaos?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: The communist-supported “threat” was very evident. For example, when I
                    made one of my fairly rare trips to Luang Prabang, the “Royal Capital” [as
                    distinguished from the “National Capital” in Vientiane], we flew on small
                    airplanes which were just able to fly above the anti-aircraft fire of the Pathet
                    Lao stationed between Vientiane and Luang Prabang. The Pathet Lao had “infested”
                    a great deal of Laos, practically to the outskirts of Vientiane. That was the
                    situation in northern Laos. When the Lao government forces moved a little
                    farther South toward Savannakhet [in central Laos, on the Mekong River], the
                    Pathet Lao anti-aircraft did not reach that far, of course.</p>
                <p>A metaphor which often came to my mind when I traveled in the countryside, and
                    every Foreign Service officer wants to get out and see the countryside, was that
                    so much of the country was “infested” by the Pathet Lao, Vientiane was sort of
                    an island. Other places, like Luang Prabang, and Sam Neua, in northern Laos,
                    were other islands. All around us and between these “islands” were
                    shark-infested seas, and the sharks were called “Pathet Lao.” The situation was
                    that bad.</p>
                <p>This was the situation in northern Laos. Southern Laos was where the
                    anti-communists retreated to when the civil war broke out in August, 1960. Q:
                    What was happening before August, 1960? It sounds as if a war was going on,
                    anyway.</p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: Yes. There was a guerrilla war going on in the countryside. The royal
                    government controlled all of the major towns in the country. However, as I just
                    indicated, it could not reach many of these towns by road. That was the
                    beginning of the operation in support of the “Montagnard” [mountain people],
                    whom we called the “Meo” or “Hmong.” Supporting the Meo was a particular
                    responsibility of the CIA people. There was a particularly “heroic” CIA officer
                    who, every couple of weeks, would go up to Sam Neua, which was way up in
                    northern Laos. He was the source of many stories about the “beleaguered” Meo
                    contingent up there, surrounded by Pathet Lao and eventually overwhelmed by
                    them. So traveling around and working in the provinces in Laos in 1960 and 1961
                    was a dangerous and sometimes fatal business. We lost a few of our colleagues
                    there, some of them in air accidents.</p>
                <pb facs="0074" n="Page0074"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the Lao politicians and the
                        other Lapeople you were dealing with?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: It's hard to answer that. The Lao, as people, are very lovable and
                    charming. However, their culture and their whole way of thinking is so different
                    from ours. I began to look on them as people who were just trying to survive and
                    to provide as best they could for their families and other people close to them.
                    They were just trying to figure out, day by day, which way to jump. That was the
                    theory that I had.</p>
                <p>The Lao were not terribly sophisticated. When my wife and I arrived in Laos and,
                    for all I know, this may still be true, there was only one high school in Laos.
                    One “lyc�e” in the whole country! The lyc�e, of course, was a school with a
                    French curriculum, located in Vientiane. You can imagine the level of
                    sophistication of the people below the high-ranking government officials. Even
                    in Vientiane, below a certain level, you couldn't find people who could speak
                    even “pigeon French” [or “Fran�ais Negrillon” or “Fran�ais Petit N�gre,” as the
                    French used to call it].</p>
                <p>Q: You had come from the Turkish desk in the State Department. You were concerned
                    about having “too many Americans” with NATO and so forth, with the subsequent
                    impact on Turkish culture. Did this type of concern carry over to Laos, when you
                    talk about the number of CIA and U.S. military people?</p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: It was a very different kind of concern. My dismay at what my wife and
                    I found in Laos brought me very close to giving up my career as a Foreign
                    Service officer. I had the feeling that “we Americans,” that is, United States
                    government officials, had no idea of what we were doing. We were just
                    floundering around in Laos, misleading these poor, simple, unsophisticated
                    people and expecting more than we were going to get. I felt that in that
                    particular, little corner of the world that we were in, we didn't know what we
                    were doing, we didn't know where we were going, and we had no “vision” of the
                    future.</p>
                <pb facs="0075" n="Page0075"/>
                <p>Then it became evident from Washington that President John Kennedy had decided to
                    make a “stand” in Vietnam and to cut our losses and whatever strings we had in
                    Laos. I don't know that anybody said it this way, so many words, but we in the
                    embassy in Vientiane said this to each other. Governor Averill Harriman was
                    appointed to negotiate some kind of “arrangement” in Laos. By the way, later on,
                    when our efforts in Vietnam turned sour, many people referred to the “Ho Chi
                    Minh Trail” [supply line from North Vietnam to South Vietnam, through Laos] as
                    the “Averill Harriman Memorial Highway.” However, I later worked closely with
                    Averill Harriman. I want to make the point that he was a very loyal member of
                    the Kennedy administration. If he made a bargain that way, at the Conference on
                    Laos in Geneva in 1962, it's because President Kennedy told him to do so. So if
                    you want to call the “Ho Chi Minh Trail” something else, you could call it the
                    “John F. Kennedy Memorial Highway.” Why? Because it was Kennedy's policy that
                    Harriman was carrying out during the Laos negotiations in 1961-1962.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you follow these negotiations at Geneva? In the
                        first place, they started under the Eisenhower administration and then moved
                        to the Kennedy administration.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the feeling on how the negotiations started and
                        how theended?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: In retrospect, we all sort of cheered over the whole history of our
                    involvement in Indochina. I can't really put myself back, after all that's
                    happened, into what I thought in 1958 about Indochina. I thought that we had
                    sort of come to a general agreement. Being a Foreign Service officer working
                    somewhere else in the world, I tried to keep up with these things. However, I'm
                    just trying to project myself back in time. My view was that Indochina was an
                    area that we had sort of agreed to neutralize. After all, we had the Accords
                    from the Conference in Geneva in 1954 and we thought that this had all been
                    settled. However, then other things happened. I had the feeling that Washington
                    had “changed its mind” and that we had decided to be more aggressive in
                    Indochina but had not really thought the matter through. I still have many
                    questions in my own mind. We were in Vietnam but we didn't know where we were
                    going. I certainly had that feeling about Laos.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At some point wasn't there a military plan to insert a lot
                        oAmerican troops into Laos? Were you aware of this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: I just heard talk of this. It was all on a “need to know” basis, and
                    since I didn't need to know, I wasn't told very much about it.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In the long run our common sense came back, and since
                        there was nairport in Laos, what were we going to do with these troops?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: The infrastructure of Laos was all wrong. Our military people there,
                    the men in the white shorts and stockings, knew this, too. However, they were
                    disciplined people, and if somebody gave them an order, they would say, “Yes,
                    sir,” salute, and go off to do what they were ordered to do.</p>
                <p>Q: You mentioned that you were not on the best of terms or didn't care for
                    Ambassador Horace Smith. Could you talk about him as an ambassador and so
                    forth?</p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: Ambassador Horace Smith was a remote figure to almost everybody at the
                    embassy in Vientiane. He chose to conduct much of his telegraphic traffic with
                    Washington on what we later called a “NODIS,” or “No Distribution” basis. So
                    most of his reports on his conversations and his instructions from Washington
                    were simply not distributed to anybody else in the embassy. If the DCM [deputy
                    chief of mission], who was John Holt, ever saw any of this cable traffic, he
                    never told any of us about it. I was on very congenial terms with John Holt, who
                    was a very nice person.</p>
                <p>The way that Ambassador Horace Smith managed the embassy, he had a
                    French-American FSO, a lady who had joined the Foreign Service as a “Wristonee”
                    [”lateralized” into the Foreign Service under a program set up in the mid-1950s
                    by Henry Wriston, a former Dean of Brown College]. She had been a teacher of
                    French, I believe, at one of the colleges near Baltimore. I believe that it was
                    Hood or Goucher College. She was bilingual in French and English. Ambassador
                    Smith took her everywhere, and she was in on everything. However, she never told
                    any of us anything. So the conduct of our official relations with Laos was being
                    carried on by Ambassador Horace Smith and this very brilliant but
                    “close-mouthed” lady, named Francoise Queneau. She has long since retired from
                    the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>All of this was going on, and the rest of the embassy and the mission were only
                    told, selectively, of what was going on between the Lao Prime Minister and
                    Ambassador Smith, and the ambassador and Washington. So we were all, literally,
                    “floundering.”</p>
                <p>However, when Winthrop Brown arrived as ambassador to Laos, the whole situation
                    changed. We had “Country Team” meetings [staff meetings]. I was assigned to do
                    what old-time Foreign Service officers remember as the “WEEKA” [originally the
                    acronym for the “Weekly Airgram” but later meant a weekly summary sent in by
                    cable]. Things changed, almost from “night to day,” in the sense that we knew
                    what Ambassador Brown was thinking about doing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What happened to Ambassador Horace Smith?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0077" n="Page0077"/>
                <p>NEWBERRY: I think that he retired soon after leaving Laos. He was assigned for a
                    while as a “Diplomat in Residence” at Sarah Lawrence College. Then he retired
                    and stayed on at Sarah Lawrence as a member of the faculty. I think that's where
                    he was serving when he died, several years after he retired.</p>
                <p>Q: Did you get any “feel” about how Ambassador Winthrop Brown was assigned to
                    Laos? He was an “East Asian hand.” What was his impression in Laos when he came
                    and took a look at the situation there? What were you and other officers in the
                    embassy getting from him about the situation in Laos?</p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: Unfortunately for Ambassador Brown, he didn't have much time because, I
                    think that in a matter of two weeks after he arrived, we had the so-called “coup
                    d'�tat” when a young, Pathet Lao Captain [”Commandant” in French], named Kong
                    Le, under really bizarre circumstances and not knowing really how far he would
                    be able to continue with this effort, in effect, “took over the Lao government.”
                    I later had a conversation with him. His French was about as good as my French.
                    He told me that he had planned this whole “coup” on the basis of a training
                    course that the French military had given him on how to defend against this kind
                    of coup. He decided to turn it around. So the French taught him how to carry out
                    a coup d'�tat.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was Kong Le after?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: Of course, all of the Pathet Lao military people wanted to win control
                    of the country. However, the strange thing about it is that he was such a
                    low-ranking officer, only a “Commandant.” Then, of course, his superior officers
                    quickly reacted to what he had done, and Prince Souphannouvong, the head of the
                    Pathet Lao, in addition to his supporters, quickly made use of the coup.
                    However, for a long time we were dealing in Vientiane with Captain Kong Le.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, Vientiane had been occupied by Pathet Lao troops, and we couldn't do
                    anything, even function, without checking with Kong Le and the group of
                    uneducated people around him. Then the “educated” cadre of the Pathet Lao came
                    into Vientiane and set up an improvised “coalition government.” This didn't last
                    long, by the way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These Pathet Lao had been shooting at you previously. All
                        of sudden, they were in Vientiane.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: I should say that this was a “bloodless coup d'etat.” The Royal Lao
                    Army didn't put up any fight against the coup. The big fight came later on. In
                    retrospect, although I was not privy to the planning, it soon became evident
                    that Washington, including the Pentagon and the royal Thai government in
                    Bangkok, were organizing to “roll back” the Pathet Lao. The first thing we knew,
                    there was an all-out civil war.</p>
                <pb facs="0078" n="Page0078"/>
                <p>General Phoumi Nosavan, the chief of staff of the Royal Lao Army, was our “chosen
                    instrument” in the campaign to re-take Vientiane. That's where we got into the
                    highest drama of all, with the “Battle of Vientiane,” which took place, I
                    believe, in December, 1960.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, before we get to the “Battle of Vientiane,” how did
                        you operate? What had been the “enemy” was now inside the gates and
                        controlling Vientiane. How did you work during this particular time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: In fairly short order the “Princes,” namely Prince Souphannouvong and
                    Prince Souvanna Phouma, cobbled together a sort of “coalition” in which there
                    were Pathet Lao ministers as well as ministers who supported Souvanna Phouma in
                    the government. Souvanna Phouma was the Prime Minister, but, as I say, there
                    were Pathet Lao ministers in the government, too.</p>
                <p>I must say that we weren't accomplishing very much at this time. My role was just
                    trying to figure out who the “players” were every day. That is, who was in which
                    post. My job, from day to day, was sort of to identify who the “personalities”
                    were.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you “constrained” or could you go out and “knock on
                        doors?”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: We could travel around the city. We were not “constrained,” except that
                    we learned to be cautious because there were so many Americans at large. We
                    learned to be careful to make sure that we did not find ourselves in the same
                    office, at the same time, and on the same errand as another American. There
                    might be representatives of two or three different agencies doing the same thing
                    I was doing. We had a large AID [Agency for International Development] mission
                    in Vientiane, too.</p>
                <p>A lot of our time and effort was spent in trying to coordinate with other
                    American officials and agencies, rather than with the Lao government. That's my
                    recollection of this period.</p>
                <p>Q: What about the CIA? They'd been running a sort of “active campaign” in other
                    places. I would have thought that the Pathet Lao would want to expel the CIA
                    people, or something like that.</p>
                <pb facs="0079" n="Page0079"/>
                <p>NEWBERRY: The Pathet Lao were there, but they had a pretty tenuous hold on
                    Vientiane. They knew that the Royal Lao Army and the royal Thai government were
                    organizing to push the Pathet Lao out of power. So the Pathet Lao was not in a
                    position to do an awful lot of detailed targeting of people. My impression was
                    that Captain Kong Le did not expect to take over Vientiane. The Pathet Lao were
                    sort of surprised at their success. They really didn't have a “scheme,” in the
                    sense of a classical, communist scheme, to go in and get rid of the
                    intellectuals. There was none of that. Everything was very improvised.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did this all play out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: With massive support, both financial and material, from the United
                    States government, and working through the royal Lao government, General Phoumi
                    Nosavan, the chief of staff of the Royal Lao Army, organized a military “push”
                    against the Pathet Lao occupation of Vientiane. He was operating from his
                    headquarters in Savannakhet [central Laos, on the Mekong River]. Toward the end
                    of November, 1960, he was getting close to Vientiane. I'm sorry, but we'll have
                    to check all of these dates. In December, 1960, there was a pitched battle for
                    the city of Vientiane, insofar as the Pathet Lao Army and the Royal Lao Army
                    could undertake a pitched battle.</p>
                <p>The battle of Vientiane went on for four or five days. We had the odd
                    circumstance that, at one point, General Phoumi, who was our “chosen
                    instrument,” was lobbing shells into downtown Vientiane, and they were hitting
                    the American embassy chancery. The Vientiane “Fire Brigade” was trying to put
                    out the fire at one end of the chancery. We knew that we were going to have to
                    get out of there. Therefore, at the other end of the chancery in the code room
                    we were trying to burn all of the classified documents. So at the same moment we
                    were putting out a fire at one end of the building and setting a fire at the
                    other end! I mention that to epitomize the absurdity of the situation.
                    Eventually, we closed the chancery for a day or two.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about you and your wife at this time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: Very early on in the process the powers that be in the embassy knew
                    about this military assault against the Pathet Lao in Vientiane. They ordered
                    the evacuation of all of the wives and children, the so-called “dependents.”
                    They were all evacuated to Thailand. My wife, who was several months pregnant,
                    was evacuated to Bangkok and lived in virtual “exile” there for the next year
                    and a half. Our first child was born in Bangkok. This evacuation situation
                    continued for the rest of my tour in Laos. The families had not been allowed to
                    return by the time I left Laos. I went to Bangkok and got my wife and child in
                    December, 1961, prior to going on to my next post.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you had the “Battle of Vientiane.” Then what
                        happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: Then General Phoumi's forces, the Royal Lao Army, retook control of
                    Vientiane. The Pathet Lao left the capital, and the situation returned to the
                    “status quo ante.” The Pathet Lao was still the net gainer in all of this. On a
                    parallel track Averill Harriman and the Pathet Lao side were negotiating in
                    Geneva about setting up a so-called “Conference on Laos.” They tried to work out
                    a “modus vivendi” between the communists and “our side” in Laos.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the attitude toward these negotiations in Geneva?
                        Wathere a feeling that “our side” was going to be “sold out” or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: That was the general feeling. We thought that we would make the best
                    deal that we could. We had the perception that we were going to make our stand
                    in Vietnam and cut our losses in Laos. That was the general view.Because we
                    didn't have the same level of virtually “instantaneous communications” that we
                    have now, we didn't get daily summaries of what was going on at the Conference
                    on Laos. From time to time we would hear what was going on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Once you got to the “status quo ante bellum,” did you go
                        back tknocking on doors and doing what you'd been doing previously?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: Yes, pretty much the same thing. However, we did this with a good deal
                    more sophistication and a much better sense of direction. We had Ambassador
                    Brown, and the man who succeeded John Holt as DCM was much more in the Foreign
                    Service tradition. He made it a point to...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the new DCM?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: His name was Bob Keel, who has died since then. We had a much better
                    sense of a traditional, Foreign Service “team,” working together, than we had
                    under Ambassador Horace Smith. Of course, since our wives and children were
                    still “living in exile” in Bangkok, we had a great deal more time to spend
                    together. We had lots more poker and “Scrabble” games in the evenings, because
                    there was little or no social life.</p>
                <p>Q: Did you ever feel, at times, that perhaps you and the other members of the
                    embassy staff were learning far too much about this rather “improvised” Lao
                    government, or not?</p>
                <pb facs="0081" n="Page0081"/>
                <p>NEWBERRY: I did. I wouldn't want to put words in the mouths of other members of
                    the staff, when we were all living in Vientiane as “unwilling bachelors.” We had
                    an awful lot of time to talk to one another. I think that my own, personal
                    reaction to all of this went deeper. I was very troubled about our sense of
                    national purpose. We seemed able to spend so much of our national treasure and
                    effort on such an inconsequential corner of the world. I had some serious doubts
                    about whether I wanted to stay in the diplomatic service. However, my own vision
                    of it was very much complicated by the fact that I'd persuaded this lady to
                    marry me and come out to Laos and live. And then look what I got her into! So I
                    said to myself that it would not be fair for me to leave the Foreign Service
                    without letting her have a “normal” Foreign Service experience. So I stayed in
                    the Foreign Service and had a different experience later on.</p>
                <p>In my view it was a very personal matter for me to spend, what, six or seven
                    months with my bride in Vientiane and then have her sent off, well advanced in
                    pregnancy. She used to say that, apart from the one weekend a month I was given
                    to go and visit her and the baby in Bangkok, she used to feel like Madame
                    Butterfly, pacing up and down with the baby, wondering whether the father of her
                    child would come back! That's a joke, of course. However, that was the kind of
                    life in exile that SHE was leading.</p>
                <p>My own recollection of the situation in Laos and my personal involvement in it
                    are all tied up with what happened to my bride and my first born child.</p>
                <p>Q: Absolutely! What about Ambassador Winthrop Brown? He got “hit” with this whole
                    situation, rather early in his time in Vientiane. Did he express any concerns
                    about what we were doing in Laos or was he just being a “good soldier?”</p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: I think that he was being a “good soldier,” a very earnest and
                    reflective one. Since the embassy Marine guards were in on this situation, too,
                    I would say that I did the same thing for Ambassador Brown for years before he
                    ever came to Vientiane. I kept a daily, UNCLASSIFIED journal. When I was embassy
                    duty officer and was checking around the office, I read some of his journal from
                    the time he was DCM [deputy chief of mission] in New Delhi, India. The Marine
                    guards told me that they had found some of his journals since he had come to
                    Vientiane. This was all UNCLASSIFIED. I said: “Well, that's indecent! What were
                    you doing?” But some of these journals were later published. His UNCLASSIFIED
                    account of the “Battle of Vientiane” appears in “The Foreign Service Reader,”
                    which was published by the American Foreign Service Association [AFSA].</p>
                <pb facs="0082" n="Page0082"/>
                <p>I mention this because Ambassador Brown was a very thoughtful man who had a sense
                    of history and the place of things. However, as far as his view of Laos was
                    concerned, I would say that he was very much like Secretary of State Dean Rusk.
                    You know, during the Vietnam crisis Dean Rusk was often one of the “true
                    believers,” God rest his soul. That was the impression that I had of Winthrop
                    Brown. He was a very disciplined, competent, capable Foreign Service officer,
                    and he believed in what we were doing. How, I don't know, but I give him credit
                    for it, and I admire him for having been a man of such integrity. I have to
                    believe that he really believed.</p>
                <p>Q: Dan, we've talked about Ambassador Winthrop Brown being a “true believer” in
                    what we were doing in Laos. Do you feel that some of the other embassy officers
                    in Vientiane held the same view? You said that you were sitting around, talking
                    to each other in the evenings. You had plenty of time to spend in “bull
                    sessions.” Was there much concern about “what the hell are we doing here in
                    Laos” and all that?</p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: Oh, very much so. Some of my contemporaries and some others who were
                    younger than I was had lots of questions about what we were doing. However,
                    instead of making a really, extensive analysis, I must recall that we were in a
                    really remote corner of the world. We didn't get the “Herald Tribune.” If we got
                    a copy of the USIA [United States Information Agency] “Wireless File” three or
                    four days later, we were lucky. We were pretty isolated from the world out there
                    in Laos.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you meet with any journalists?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: Yes, some very competent reporters were assigned to Vientiane. They
                    especially began to come to Vientiane after the Kong Le “coup d'etat,” in 1960.
                    Some of them regularly made the rounds. Stanley Karnow of “Time” used to come
                    down from Hong Kong, Takashi Oka from the “Christian Science Monitor” came there
                    about once every three months, as well as other reporters who went on to be very
                    distinguished foreign correspondents. They were on that “Southeast Asian beat.”
                    They were checking us out. Some of us had, what shall I call them, “no holds
                    barred conversations” with them. I must say, in my candid conversations with
                    journalists that none of them ever “betrayed” me. I was very careful, of course,
                    which ones I chose to be candid with. I went to Vientiane very early on in my
                    career. My wife had some experience as a press officer. I found that some of the
                    most interesting and enlightening conversations about the involvement of the
                    United States in Indochina came from talking to visiting newspapermen, and not
                    from my own colleagues.</p>

                <p>NEWBERRY: I thought that there was going to be more fighting. I couldn't say what
                    kind of fighting but I just had a feeling that this was just a pause and that
                    there was going to be more fighting. We could see what our own people were doing
                    in Vietnam. We were just building up for something bigger, but I couldn't make
                    it more specific than that.</p>

                </p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: I had to rely on our intelligence reports. We didn't have any direct
                    evidence on the ground in Vientiane, except that, when the Pathet Lao was
                    included in the coalition government, they were following a very obvious
                    pro-Chinese or pro-Soviet line. However, we didn't have any direct evidence of
                    that. Of course, the Soviet Union opened an embassy in Vientiane after the
                    coalition government was established. We, at the second secretary or first
                    secretary level, whatever I was at the time, didn't have any contact with these
                    communist representatives.</p>

                <p>NEWBERRY: My next post was Tehran, Iran. This meant going back into the GTI
                    [Greek, Turkish, and Iranian] area. In a sense, this was my “home base,” and
                    that's how I looked at it. We were talking earlier about the changes in the way
                    personnel assignments were made. I just took it upon myself to write to the
                    director of GTI, who had succeeded Owen Jones. This was Robert Miner, my last
                    consul general in Istanbul, who was now in charge of GTI Affairs. I asked him if
                    there was a spot for me and, lo and behold, I was assigned as deputy political
                    counselor in the embassy in Tehran. That was my next post.</p>

                <pb facs="0084" n="Page0084"/>
                <p>NEWBERRY: Let me just add one thing more. In between Vientiane and Tehran I was
                    assigned to something called the “Mid Career Course” in the FSI [Foreign Service
                    Institute]. That was one of the programs that the FSI organizes. I was a little
                    shocked to be told that I was in “mid career.” So far I had only been in the
                    Foreign Service for 12 years. Here I was already in “mid career,” but that's
                    what they called it. So I spent three months in Washington at this course, and
                    it was very nice to be able to do that. I actually didn't get to Tehran until
                    July 5, 1962. I was very careful not to arrive before July 4, as otherwise I
                    might have been involved in preparations for the July 4 reception!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation in Tehran when you arrived
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: By 1962 the situation was that we had many years of a cozy relationship
                    between the United States government and the “Shahinshah.” It was sort of a
                    fixed, “mind set” for people in Washington that one of our principal objectives
                    in Iran was to keep the Shah favorably disposed toward us, so that we could
                    maintain all of the “listening stations” and so forth that we had and that we
                    would have uninterrupted access to the oil supplies of the Persian Gulf. The
                    fact that the Shah of Iran had pervasive intelligence organizations around the
                    country and was a dictator did not seem to daunt us.</p>
                <p>I'm not complaining, because we had an interesting and treasured experience
                    during our two years in Tehran. However, as a political officer, it was a very
                    strange situation to be in. There was a Parliament, but every candidate for
                    Parliament was “hand picked” by the Shah. So there was no real Parliamentary or
                    political activity that was worth reporting on. But we found other things to
                    write about.</p>
                <p>Q: Later on, and this became renowned in the Foreign Service, political officers
                    assigned to Iran in the 1970s were told not to report anything “bad” about the
                    Shah or the Shah's government. Were there any indications of this in the early
                    1960s?</p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: That was pretty much the atmosphere, but it depended on the ambassador
                    or the political counselor as to how much “candid” political reporting was
                    allowed to go out. There was a lot of sort of “back channel” traffic. When
                    someone would write a Memorandum of Conversation, although it might not go into
                    a telegram or an airgram, a “courtesy copy” of the memorandum would find its way
                    through the pouch to some guy we knew on the Iranian desk. He would share this
                    copy of the memorandum around the Department, but it was never stated to be an
                    official communication.</p>
                <pb facs="0085" n="Page0085"/>
                <p>During my time in Iran there was a very talented and, I would say, “brilliant”
                    young Foreign Service officer named Bill Miller, William Graham Miller, who is
                    today the ambassador to the Ukraine. Bill Miller cultivated members of the
                    National Front who were the supporters of Mossadeq. They were very much involved
                    in maneuvering to try to persuade the Shah to have a more enlightened government
                    or, who knows, maybe take over the government. Ambassador Julius Holmes and
                    Harry Schwartz, the Political Counselor, as well as Schwartz's successor as
                    Political Counselor, Martin Herz, allowed Bill Miller to keep up these contacts
                    with the National Front.</p>
                <p>Although we had a sort of channel to the National Front, in the end it was not
                    the National Front that overthrew the Shah. It was the Muslim fundamentalists.
                    In the end the National Front came to grief, along with the Shah. At least, this
                    was one mitigating circumstance, during my time in Iran, that the leadership of
                    the embassy had the good sense to keep some kind of channel open to the National
                    Front, in opposition to the Shah.</p>
                <p>It fell to my duty, when President Kennedy was assassinated, to get in touch with
                    the two, leading National Front figures, each one of whom had been Iranian
                    ambassador to Washington. I persuaded them to come to Washington to the memorial
                    service for President Kennedy which was organized. It was the only time since
                    the Shah returned to Iran, or later fell from power, that the only official,
                    open contact between them and the American embassy was at the memorial service
                    for President John F. Kennedy.</p>
                <p>Q: How did you go about your business as a political officer in Tehran? What
                    would be a typical day in going about your business in Tehran?</p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: I should explain that my role as the “number two” officer in the
                    Political Section varied. My first political counselor was Harry Schwartz, who
                    was a pretty “laid back” guy and easy to work with. He let me get out and “do my
                    own thing.” When I figured that there was no political reporting to do, I did
                    some airgrams and despatches on institutions in Iran. In addition, I spent part
                    of my time, and this turned out to be a rather time-consuming aspect of my job,
                    keeping in touch with our consulates. We had four constituent posts or
                    consulates in Iran: in Tabriz, in Meshed, in Khorramshahr, and the other in
                    Isfahan.</p>
                <p>It had been decided, before I got there, that the consulates needed a “friend in
                    court,” somebody who would watch out for their concerns and interests and would
                    show recognition of what the consulates were doing. So I was known as the
                    “consulate coordinator.” I spent a lot of time doing that. I made frequent trips
                    to the consulates and talked to the people in the consulates to maintain
                    personal contact with them. A lot of my time in the embassy was spent in
                    “following through” to see that, not only political or economic reporting from
                    the consulates was properly evaluated, but also that the administrative and
                    personal problems of people in the consulates were taken care of.</p>
                <pb facs="0086" n="Page0086"/>
                <p>I found this liaison work with the consulates a very rewarding side of my work in
                    Iran, although it was not what you might expect a political officer to be doing.
                    However, in retrospect, it equipped me later on to function more effectively as
                    the principal officer of a consulate. I think that I was much better prepared
                    and more effective as a principal officer because I had had this experience of
                    being a “friend in court” for the consuls.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We had a very extensive reporting program in Iran.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: Indeed, we did. However, a great deal of it was managed banother U.S.
                    government agency.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're talking about the CIA.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: Yes.</p>
                <p>Q: Was there any difficulty, as far as you were concerned, about having two
                    organizations reporting? Were the CIA people reporting one thing and you were
                    reporting another?</p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: I don't think that that was necessarily true, because a great deal of
                    the CIA activity in Iran was “operational,” rather than gathering information. I
                    can only guess what it was and I wouldn't want to go on record, because it would
                    be on the basis of my impressions only. However, my view was that a great deal
                    of the CIA resources and staff were, as I say, “operational.”</p>
                <p>Let me make a side remark, Stu, about CIA activity in general in Iran. You will
                    recall that in our conversation on Laos I made such a point about the CIA being
                    all over the place. They were all over the place, but in a different way, in
                    Iran. For example, the CIA chief of station had been in Iran for years and
                    stayed there for a time after I left.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Are you referring to Kermit Roosevelt?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: No. This was Gratian Yatsevich, who came after Kermit Roosevelt.
                    Yatsevich was a very colorful man who died in 1997. He saw and had more
                    extensive conversations with the Shah-in-Shah of Iran than the ambassador did.
                    That gives you, in a nutshell, what the situation was.</p>
                <pb facs="0087" n="Page0087"/>
                <p>I want to hark back to my remarks about the situation in Laos. I would like to
                    mention another of these “absurdities” for which I blame the State Department.
                    Somebody before my time, and before Harry Schwartz's time, was very upset
                    because, in the embassy in Vientiane we had two political sections. This
                    situation was not unique to Tehran. There was the CIA “Political Section” as a
                    distinct entity within the chancery building, apart from the State Department
                    Political Section.</p>
                <p>One of Harry Schwartz's predecessor's as Political Counselor had persuaded the
                    State Department, and they were slow to act on this proposal, that we should
                    have just as many political officers on the Diplomatic List [published by the
                    Iranian Ministry of Foreign Affairs] as the CIA people did. So we could keep a
                    “balance” in this way. In Tehran the traditional, State Department organization
                    had something like five or six political officers in a country like Iran which
                    had no political parties to speak of. So we had a lot of frustrated, junior
                    officers without real jobs to do. My function in Tehran as a deputy political
                    counselor was to manage this situation and find useful things for these junior
                    officers to do. The only reason that we had so many FSOs was just to
                    “counterbalance” in terms of numbers the CIA officers down the hall.</p>
                <p>This situation was carried to an even more absurd degree. I hadn't been in Tehran
                    long when I found out that in the embassy mail room, where they were sorting out
                    the incoming mail, distribution was made to one of two categories, “Political 1”
                    and “Political 2.” When a new political counselor arrived, he said that that is
                    not acceptable. He said that there should be one political section, as far as he
                    was concerned. So he included all of the CIA people in the Political Section. Of
                    course, what the employees in the mail room did was to sort out the mail in two
                    categories anyway and just go through a show of combining the two political
                    sections. The mail was delivered upstairs in one package but in two, separate
                    bundles. That's how the Iranians understood the distinction between the two
                    aspects of the Political Section. This gives you an insight on some of the
                    traditional, “silly” things that we have done in the Foreign Service over the
                    years.</p>

                </p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: Only sort of “inferentially.” It was such a big organization and so
                    pervasive that the journalists who came to Tehran reported on everybody.
                    Everybody reported on it. Of course, when I said that the CIA people were
                    “operational,” a great deal of their operations were done through SAVAK, the
                    internal police agency of the Shah's government. So there was not much that the
                    State Department people could tell Washington about SAVAK that wasn't already in
                    the newspapers or in other agency reporting. We didn't spend a lot of our own,
                    State Department resources analyzing it.</p>
                <p>Q: What about two elements of Iranian society which, I am told, are very
                    important. One of them is the “Bazari” class, the merchants at a lower level
                    than the merchant bankers, or whatever you want to call them.</p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: We were very much aware that they were important, but somehow or other,
                    for whatever reason, and probably anyone who has studied this subject could
                    guess what it was, we did not have any good contacts with the “Bazari” class,
                    except in the provinces. The consulates were much better at getting close to the
                    “Bazari” class. They were much closer to the feeling of antipathy which the
                    “Bazari” merchants had toward the Shah's regime and were much closer to the
                    religious situation that led up to the overthrow of the Shah.</p>
                <p>Back in 1963, the Shah was trying to demonstrate that he was a modern-minded
                    monarch. He had his own reasons for trying to get control of the religious
                    foundations, the so-called “Waq” or “Waqif” groups, which held tremendous
                    stretches of agricultural land. The Shah wanted to get control of this land, and
                    he called this an “agricultural revolution.” He tried to confiscate this land
                    and sell it to the tenants. But that's not the way it worked out, and the
                    “Imams” and the “Mullahs” [two classes of religious functionaries] knew what was
                    going to happen. So there was a struggle for power.</p>
                <p>In 1963 that struggle was one of the two issues, on the basis of which the
                    Ayatollah Khomeini first rose to national prominence. He was trying to head off
                    the Shah's “land grab” which was going to take away the lands which the Imams
                    and the Mullahs controlled, through the “Waq” and “Waqif” foundations. The other
                    issue was votes for women.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was what was called the “White Revolution?”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: Yes, the “White Revolution.” That was in 1963. That's the first time
                    that any of us in the embassy, except a few people who were real specialists in
                    Iran, had even heard of Ayatollah Khomeini. However, Khomeini was very much the
                    power behind that demonstration of the “Sixth of Bahman,” the Iranian month,
                    against the “White Revolution.”</p>
                <pb facs="0089" n="Page0089"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: With the “White Revolution” taking place, this was just
                        the sorof thing that...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: There were several aspects of the “White Revolution.” The Shah had
                    assigned the educated military officers to teach literacy to the ignorant
                    peasants, and so on. There were lots of very respectable parts of the “White
                    Revolution.” However, the pious, religious people, the “Bazaris,” saw it as a
                    power grab by the Shah to eliminate the influence of the religious foundations
                    and the Ayatollah's [religious officials].</p>
                <p>Q: Did these so-called reforms, known collectively as the “White Revolution,”
                    touch a responsive chord in the embassy? I suppose that this was the sort of
                    thing that we had been pressing the Shah to do.</p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: We reported all of this with a straight face, as though we admired the
                    Shah for it. Except when things began to turn “sour,” I don't recall that we
                    ever asked why the religious people were against these reforms. The initial
                    reporting reflected all-out admiration for the Shah as the far-seeing leader of
                    Iran.</p>
                <p>Q: Were you able to see that the “White Revolution” was more of a power grab on
                    the part of the Shah? What was the feeling in the embassy about whether this
                    land would be actually distributed? How did you think that this process was
                    going to end up?</p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: Of course, there were many debates about this. Most of our contacts
                    were educated people whose sense of fair play in the scheme of things was very
                    much opposed to letting the peasants get control of the land. One of their
                    favorite refrains was: “Who's going to take care of the 'Qanats?'" The “Qanats”
                    were underground irrigation channels. This was the sort of slogan which the
                    anti-land reform people had. They said that if you let the peasants own the
                    land, nobody would maintain the irrigation system. So you have to leave the
                    “Qanats” in the hands of affluent people who know how to manage them.</p>
                <p>Of course, this was regarded as a terribly reactionary attitude. Most of us who
                    had the time and leisure to analyze the situation never believed that the Shah
                    would actually let the peasants own the land. All of the thousands of years of
                    Iranian history argued against that. Sure enough, the money that he did manage
                    to get went into the Vaqf loan in which the imperial family and a lot of
                    privileged people invested a lot of their money. The reform never, in effect,
                    really happened.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you able to report this situation as it
                        developed?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0090" n="Page0090"/>
                <p>NEWBERRY: Not me. I don't know what anybody else did but there was no “audience”
                    for that kind of reporting in the State Department, and nobody encouraged
                    it.</p>
                <p>Q: I think that it's very interesting to get a “feel” for the situation within
                    the embassy. That is, things of this nature were happening. Were you encouraged
                    to report “positively?” Was this a pervasive feeling within the embassy?</p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: I have the feeling that what we were doing was what, in Foreign Service
                    parlance during my time, was called writing “sitreps.” We were writing
                    “situation reports” or factual, short items without any significant analysis.
                    There was very little, long term analysis being done.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you getting from the consulates? Was that
                        gettinthrough?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: It was getting through to us in the Political Section of the embassy. I
                    made sure that copies of the consulate reports were “pouched” back to
                    Washington. I don't recall that an awful lot of it was incorporated into the
                    ongoing reporting. Of course, this all happened 35 years ago.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I understand.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: My recollection may be “dim,” but my general impression was that the
                    embassy leadership did not hit the Department over the head with these
                    reflections. We talked about them and even wrote notes to one another about
                    them. However, I don't recall that we really said to Washington: “You have to
                    think about this and think about it seriously.” We did not make any campaign out
                    of it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of Ambassador Julius Holmes?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0091" n="Page0091"/>
                <p>NEWBERRY: I admired him enormously. Since you've brought up the subject of
                    Ambassador Holmes, I really want to put this exchange I had with him into the
                    oral history because it was such a wonderful bit of advice to me as a Foreign
                    Service officer.Ambassador Holmes was a very busy man. He never looked very busy
                    and he was always very gracious. His residence was right there in the embassy
                    compound. It's still there, although I don't know who's living in it. Anyhow,
                    his way of more or less “catching up with things” was to save material for later
                    reflection in his “in box.” He would come into the chancery on Saturday morning
                    and sit on the sofa in his office and read this material. Then he would ask the
                    duty officer to come into his office and sit down with him. This was one of his
                    techniques for keeping up with the more junior staff. Then the ambassador and
                    the duty officer would chat for a while. It was a great privilege for me. On one
                    particular Saturday morning I had gone through the incoming and outgoing
                    traffic. I knew that the ambassador had an audience with the Shah the day
                    before. I found out then that the ambassador had been at the Imperial Palace for
                    over three hours. I saw the reporting telegram which the ambassador had sent in
                    on his conversation with the Shah. It was only about three paragraphs long!</p>
                <p>By that time I had gotten used to these little “chats” with Ambassador Holmes,
                    and I was bold enough to say: “Mr. Ambassador, you spent over three hours with
                    the Shah, but all that I saw in the reporting telegram was three paragraphs.”
                    Ambassador Holmes pulled down his pince nez glasses, looked at me, and said:
                    “Dan, always remember this. Report extensively on what the other guy said but
                    say as little as possible about what you said.” That was a wonderful lesson to a
                    Foreign Service reporting officer, and I never forgot that.</p>
                <p>Ambassador Holmes knew what his mission was. He knew, if you'll pardon the
                    expression, what his parameters were and he conducted himself magnificently.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the feeling in the Embassy about the Soviet
                        “threat” tIran and Soviet influence in Iran while you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: Of course, we always realized that Soviet troops were up in the
                    Azerbaijani Soviet Socialist Republic, just across the border to the North. If
                    things went badly in Iran, these troops could just move in. This threat was
                    never more on our minds than during the Cuban Missile Crisis.</p>

                <pb facs="0092" n="Page0092"/>
                <p>NEWBERRY: Again, it fell to my lot to be embassy duty officer on the weekend of
                    the Cuban Missile Crisis. I described this experience in the book put out by
                    AFSA [American Foreign Service Association] called, “Inside a U.S. Embassy.”
                    AFSA had asked me to write something about the experiences of an embassy duty
                    officer. We learned of the final decision about what President Kennedy was going
                    to do. I had to sort out this long message from Washington, which came in to the
                    embassy in Tehran in “reverse order.” The message came to us in the middle of
                    the night. I decided to wait until we got the actual instruction part of it to
                    wake up Ambassador Holmes.</p>
                <p>When we received the actual instruction part of this message, I brought it to
                    Ambassador Holmes, who said: “You need to do everything you can to make sure
                    that the Shah reads this message before he goes to work in the morning, because
                    it will be all over the radio and all over the world by tomorrow morning.” So
                    the code clerk and I were trying to put this message together. I drafted a
                    “Third Person” note from the ambassador to the Shah, conveying this message
                    ostensibly from President Kennedy, confiding in the Shah that he was about to
                    announce establishment of a “quarantine” around Cuba.</p>
                <p>I couldn't get anybody on the phone at the Imperial Palace, of course. I went
                    over to the gate of the Palace and talked to the Captain of the Guard, with the
                    request that he please see to it that His Majesty sees this message before he
                    has his breakfast. The Captain's answer was: “That depends on His Majesty.”
                    However, the Shah must have seen this note, because Ambassador Holmes told me
                    that the Shah never complained about not being informed about what the U.S.
                    planned to do.However, you asked me about the Soviet threat to Iran. One of the
                    things that was very much on our minds and in our reporting was that the Shah
                    was concerned about those Soviet troops which had threatened Iran in 1946, when
                    they occupied the Tabriz area. They were still there and “in spades” in 1962,
                    just North of the border. It would just take half an hour for Soviet tanks to
                    start rolling into Iran from Soviet Azerbaijan, as well as set off
                    demonstrations by the “Tudeh” Party [Masses Party] in Tehran. So in that
                    situation the Shah of Iran was following every aspect of the Cuban Missile
                    Crisis. He was thinking about how this crisis was going to affect him, of
                    course.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Dan, is there anything else that we should talk about
                        regardinIran at this time, or any other developments?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: I think that we have pretty well covered Iran. I apologize to you and
                    to anybody who reads this that I haven't had the leisure to go back and sort out
                    my notes. These are my impressions of Iran at that time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's good. I thought that we might stop at this point.
                        We arnow up to 1964 at the end of your tour in Iran. Then where did you
                        go?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0093" n="Page0093"/>
                <p>NEWBERRY: I went back to Washington then. I might talk a little bit more about my
                    experiences in Iran, particularly about personnel matters. I like to make sure
                    that these personnel questions are made clear, so that anybody analyzing the
                    Foreign Service personnel system would occasionally read this oral history.</p>
                <p>Harry Schwartz's successor as political counselor was a brilliant but difficult
                    man named Martin Herz. This was a very difficult relationship for me because, to
                    use an analogy from the German Army, he treated me as if he were a First
                    Sergeant. I found myself having to “protect” the junior officers serving under
                    me from a very temperamental and demanding Political Counselor. So I thought of
                    myself as a “Feldwebel” [corporal] serving under a First Sergeant.</p>
                <p>I was getting toward the end of my first tour of duty there in Tehran and I was
                    supposed to go on Home Leave and then come back to Iran. As it happened, the
                    officer in charge of personnel in NEA [Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs] was
                    Archer Blood. He came through Tehran. I “let my hair down” to him. He was one of
                    my great heroes in the Foreign Service, not because he had helped me out of a
                    bad situation but because he was a really outstanding, Foreign Service officer.
                    We can talk about him when we get to Bangladesh, too.</p>
                <p>Archer Blood said: “Dan, just keep quiet. I'm going back to Washington. The only
                    way we can get you out of here is by assigning you to Washington. Are you ready
                    for that?” I said: “Of course I am.” So Archer Blood quietly arranged for me to
                    be assigned to the Department as the officer in charge of CENTO [Central Treaty
                    Organization] Affairs. However, this assignment was not revealed until my wife
                    and children were safely on home leave with me. This was one of those maneuvers
                    which people used to be able to arrange for. I was able to do this to get out of
                    a very difficult and unpleasant situation.</p>
                <p>This was a good time for us to return to Washington because, during the course of
                    our home leave, it was revealed that another child was on the way. It was much
                    more convenient to have the child born in Washington.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Dan, one final question about Iran. Martin Herz was a
                        majofigure in the Foreign Service.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: Oh, very much so. I admired a lot of his accomplishments. However, as a
                    leader of men, he left an awful lot to be desired. I should say, men and women,
                    although we didn't have any women officers in Tehran at the time. He would have
                    led them, too.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did he have a different view on the Shah and what was
                        happeninthere than Harry Schwartz did?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0094" n="Page0094"/>
                <p>NEWBERRY: Oh, yes. He probed much more deeply into the situation than Schwartz
                    did. I personally liked Schwartz a lot more than Herz. However, I have to hand
                    it to Martin Herz, who was a brilliant officer. As people who knew him or have
                    read about him, he had been a court reporter before he joined the Foreign
                    Service. He took short hand and typed at 200 words a minute! The Marine guards
                    in Tehran used to tell me that he would come into the embassy at 5:00 AM. By the
                    time we arrived, at 8:00 AM, all of us had what we called “Herzograms,”
                    instructions written out to us. So what was the deputy political counselor going
                    to do? Herz had already done the deputy's work for him for the whole day, before
                    we even had our breakfast. That was the kind of virtuoso performance that Martin
                    Herz turned in.</p>
                <p>Q: With Martin Herz as Political Counselor, was there a change toward looking
                    more closely at the “White Revolution” and other things that were happening in
                    Iran?</p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: Yes. As a matter of fact, Bill Miller, a brilliant young officer who
                    was still in Tehran when I left, spent many hours talking to Martin Herz. I'm
                    sure that Herz was encouraging Bill Miller to probe more deeply into the
                    National Front. Bill Miller did not have any contacts that I knew among
                    religious people in Iran, but he did with the National Front and did a good job
                    on it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I take it that the religious leaders were almost beyond
                        reach fous.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: Pretty much so. We were aware of them, because other people told us
                    about them. We had some “third hand” information but we didn't have any
                    important, direct contacts among the religious community at all.</p>
                <p>Q: Okay, Dan, let's stop at this point. We'll pick it up again in 1964 when you
                    were taking over the CENTO [Central Treaty Organization] desk in the
                    Department.</p>
                <p>***</p>
                <p>Today is January 5, 1998. Dan, we had you going to Washington to bin charge of
                    the CENTO desk. You were there from when to when?</p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: Let's see. I came home in the summer of 1964. I was on the CENTO desk
                    for two years from the fall of 1964 to the fall of 1966, after which I moved up
                    to the Iranian desk.</p>
                <p>Q: Okay, let's stick to CENTO for the time being. CENTO was always sort of a
                    “cobbled together” organization, particularly after Iraq was rather violently
                    moved out of what had been called the “Baghdad Pact” in 1958. That was when
                    Brigadier Kaseem overthrew...</p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: King Faisal, Crown Prince Illah, and Prime Minister NurSaid.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was CENTO actually viewed by the powers that be in the
                        StatDepartment when you arrived on that desk?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: To the extent that people thought about it at all, they didn't think
                    much about CENTO. In the mind of most people, of course, CENTO was still the
                    Baghdad Pact. Since the Baghdad Pact had gone out of existence, many
                    professional diplomats were not aware that there was a surviving organization,
                    which changed its name to the Central Treaty Organization.</p>
                <p>I remember that I had been working on the Turkish desk back in 1958, at the time
                    of the revolution in Baghdad. After this they moved the headquarters of the
                    Baghdad Pact to Ankara. Of course, they had to change the name of the body. We
                    had great sport of it, trying to figure out a name. I remember that one of them
                    which we had some fun with was the “Greater West Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere.”
                    [Laughter] That was drawn from the old, World War II Japanese concept of the
                    “Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere.”</p>
                <p>However, by 1964 the Central Treaty Organization was still alive but did not have
                    much prestige. I keep referring in these interviews to my career experiences.
                    When I had my assignment to Iran “broken” and came back to the Department to
                    work on the CENTO desk, one of my friends came to me and said: “Dan, you must
                    have been desperate, because, professionally, CENTO has got to be a 'dead end.'”
                    Well, for reasons that I will explain, it was not a dead end at all, although it
                    sure looked that way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What countries belonged to CENTO at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: The members of CENTO were Britain, Turkey, Iran, and Pakistan. The
                    three, regional members were Iran, Pakistan, and Turkey, in addition to the
                    United Kingdom. The United States was never a member as such, but we fully
                    participated in all of its activities and paid our share of the annual budget.
                    The Secretary of State went to all of the meetings of the CENTO Council of
                    Ministers. We were members of CENTO in everything except name.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, in your estimate what did “de facto” membership of
                        CENTmean for the United States?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0096" n="Page0096"/>
                <p>NEWBERRY: Of course, most historians agree that the whole notion of the Baghdad
                    Pact was something in the mind of the late Secretary of State, John Foster
                    Dulles. He adopted a concept which was actually developed by a British diplomat,
                    Sir Owen Carrew, of “the Northern Tier” of countries. He thought of the
                    “Northern Tier” as consisting of Turkey, Iran, Pakistan, and even Afghanistan,
                    although they never pursued bringing Afghanistan into the organization. The
                    “Northern Tier” of countries was to serve as a barrier to Soviet intrusion into
                    the Middle East. That was the basic purpose that the architects of the Baghdad
                    Pact and the supporters of CENTO held onto. This was a way of solidifying the
                    northern approaches to the Middle East against further Soviet incursion.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you arrived on the CENTO desk, what was your
                        perception othe Soviet threat to the Middle East?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: My own view was that the Soviets had “outflanked us” because they had
                    great influence in Egypt, Syria, and other parts of the Middle East. Although
                    Turkey and Iran, and Turkey especially, stood in the way of a Soviet land
                    invasion of the Middle East, there was not much else, except symbolic value, in
                    having these three countries lined up. Of course, Pakistan, by extension, was
                    also a member of the Southeast Asian Treaty Organization [SEATO]. Pakistan had
                    the unique position of belonging to two alliances which were important to the
                    West.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Turkey did, also.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: Turkey also belonged to NATO, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So CENTO was something like a “link to a link to a
                        link.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: Yes. From the Turkish point of view they participated in, and even
                    hosted, the Baghdad Pact when it moved to Ankara, but it was always a peripheral
                    or “add on” to Turkish membership in NATO. In Turkish eyes, they agreed to
                    participate in CENTO because this was something that they believed that the
                    Americans wanted them to do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were your concerns, on the CENTO desk, during this
                        1964 t1966 period?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0097" n="Page0097"/>
                <p>NEWBERRY: On a plane of “doing it with mirrors,” I would say. CENTO had such low
                    prestige among most U.S. government agencies in Washington that I had to find
                    “artful ways” to “shore up” American participation in CENTO. CENTO didn't really
                    show up in anybody's budget anywhere in the U.S. government. Since the U.S. was
                    not a member of CENTO, when the Secretary General of CENTO came to Washington or
                    we were asked to host the 10th anniversary meeting of the Council of Ministers,
                    the Office of Protocol initially declined to let us have any money. U.S.
                    non-membership in CENTO was always an anomaly.</p>
                <p>However, professionally, I found my service on the CENTO desk a very interesting
                    experience, since I was the only person in the whole State Department who
                    understood what the mechanics of CENTO were. I found that, when I was getting
                    clearances for various things, I often had to deal at the Assistant Secretary of
                    State level because they were curious about what they were being asked to clear.
                    So I learned a lot about the Washington bureaucracy, since nobody else wanted to
                    bother to clear all of these CENTO messages. That was my fate and, although it
                    was inconsequential, in terms of advancing the national interest, to me it was
                    an education in how to maneuver and find my way around the State Department and
                    Pentagon bureaucracies.</p>
                <p>Q: Did you pick up any “nuggets of wisdom” about how things worked in those days?
                    In other words, how to get around, how to get things cleared, and how to get
                    things done?</p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: First of all, it took an awful lot of patience, and I suppose this
                    still goes on in the State Department. State Department officials are busy
                    people who pay attention to their own work, first. The poor guy who has to get a
                    CENTO message cleared usually had to hang around until 6:30 or 7:30 PM, hoping
                    to catch the signatory, the “clearance guy” before he went home. So it was a
                    time-consuming process, but, like any other Foreign Service officer, I extended
                    my contacts and got to know an awful lot of high-ranking secretaries to
                    Assistant Secretaries. Once again, it was a way of learning my way through the
                    bureaucracy.</p>
                <p>However, I would say that, in those days, when the United States was
                    “symbolically” participating in CENTO and actually putting as much money into it
                    as anybody else in the organization, it was not a “high budget” operation. The
                    people who were most interested in it were the U.S. military. There was a
                    Military Committee, and they always liked to extend their contacts. The CIA, the
                    DIA, and INR [the State Department Bureau of Intelligence Research] were
                    interested in the Counter-Subversion Committee. We met with other CENTO
                    colleagues periodically, and they found it very useful. However, all of the
                    other committee meetings were very “pro forma.”</p>
                <pb facs="0098" n="Page0098"/>
                <p>I had to organize American participation in them and finally get somebody to
                    attend an Economic Committee meeting. Usually, I had to figure out a reason why
                    they would want to go to Ankara or Tehran in the first place. I would tell them
                    that this was a convenient way of getting your business done and also
                    representing the United States. I thought of all of this as “doing it with
                    mirrors.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was your boss?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: I was called the officer in charge of CENTO Affairs. My office was part
                    of the Office of Regional Affairs in the Bureau of Near East/South Asian
                    Affairs. The Office of Regional Affairs took care of anything which sort of
                    crossed country lines, such as United Nations affairs and so on. In other words,
                    multilateral organizations of any sort where more than one NEA office took part
                    came under the Office of Regional Affairs. I also did UN work, so I was not
                    entirely preoccupied with CENTO Affairs. Since I was working in NEA Regional
                    Affairs, I also handled UN matters.</p>
                <p>Q: Looking back at what we know historically of the three nations of Turkey,
                    Iran, and Pakistan, one of the main purposes during the Cold Warwas intelligence
                    collection, mainly through using listening posts. In Pakistan, in the earlier
                    period, there was a base for U-2 [reconnaissance] flights. I would have thought
                    that you would have had a strong, intelligence factor in everything that you did
                    there.</p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: Actually, you would expect that, and I expected that. However, the
                    intelligence services of those countries met routinely with one another,
                    bilaterally, and the meetings of the CENTO Counter-Subversion Committee were
                    just another gathering of the same people who were seeing one another from time
                    to time, anyway. However, regarding the three regional countries, as was often
                    the case until the fall of the Shah, the Bureau of NEA Affairs in the State
                    Department was “transfixed” by the Shahinshah of Iran. That was the first thing
                    that we thought about. Our first question would be: “How do we square this with
                    the Shah,” or, “Is this what the Shah would expect?” This was very much the
                    atmosphere that we all dealt with in NEA. Of course, the assumption was that our
                    intelligence from our listening posts, satellites, and whatever else we had out
                    there was particularly important. Only the Shah could guarantee the continued
                    collection of this intelligence. At least, that was the assumption.</p>
                <p>Q: During the 1964-1966 period were you looking at any Soviet military threats to
                    the Middle East or did we think that there was any probability of anything
                    happening there during this time?</p>
                <pb facs="0099" n="Page0099"/>
                <p>NEWBERRY: Not in CENTO as such, but the NEA Bureau was very mindful of Soviet
                    propaganda and political games in places like Egypt, Syria, and so forth, as
                    well as the propaganda war. One of the ways that all of this came home to me on
                    the CENTO desk was that, earlier on, at one time the Soviets had made a big
                    thing out of the Baghdad Pact and CENTO and what this all signified. Then it all
                    began to drop off. When the Soviet propaganda machine stopped maligning CENTO,
                    we knew that the organization had outlived its usefulness. [Laughter]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any particular crises during this time that you
                        had tdeal with?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: That I personally had to deal with? I wouldn't say so. CENTO was so far
                    off center stage that I never felt that I had to deal with a crisis. The only
                    crisis that I had to deal with was when I was deployed up to the United Nations,
                    for two years running, to be the NEA representative on our Delegation to the UN
                    General Assembly.</p>
                <p>While we're on that subject and are talking about Pakistan, I have to tell you
                    about a very amusing experience I had. During the second time I was assigned to
                    be the NEA representative on our UN Delegation to the General Assembly, I was
                    spared from having to be away from my family for the entire period of the
                    General Assembly. I just went up during the first two weeks, when the Secretary
                    of State goes up to meet with the Foreign Ministers. I was assigned to arrange
                    the meetings between the NEA Foreign Ministers and Secretary of State Rusk. I
                    would take notes and prepare the reporting cables.</p>
                <p>On this particular occasion it was just after the Rann of Kutch war between India
                    and Pakistan [in 1965]. I had been following the reporting cables in Washington
                    and also when I was at the UN. When Pakistani Foreign Minister Bhutto met with
                    Secretary Rusk, at the United States Mission to the UN, I knew what Bhutto was
                    going to say and I knew what Secretary Rusk was going to say back to him. So I
                    just sat there and listened and didn't take any notes. When the meeting was
                    over, I prepared the MemCon [memorandum of conversation] and the reporting cable
                    blindfolded, because the two sides just restated their positions.</p>
                <pb facs="0100" n="Page0100"/>
                <p>Well, a funny thing happened, when I finished my stint at the UN and came back to
                    the Department in Washington. Bruce Laingen, who was then the officer in charge
                    of Pakistan Affairs, said to me: “Dan, I had a curious question from somebody at
                    the Pakistani embassy who had been up at the UN. He wanted to know if we had
                    'taped' the Secretary's office so that we could record the conversation.” I
                    think that Bruce told him: “Of course we don't 'tape' the Secretary's office.”
                    The Pakistani said: “We noticed that your note taker didn't take any notes.”
                    [Laughter] The simple explanation was that I didn't need to take any notes
                    because both sides' positions were so familiar to me. Sure enough, we did send a
                    reporting telegram on the Bhutto-Rusk meeting, and I'm sure that anybody who
                    read it might say: “I'm sure I've read this before, somewhere.” However, I swear
                    that we did not tape the meetings between the Secretary of State and Foreign
                    Ministers at the U.S. Mission to the UN.</p>
                <p>Q: Did you find yourself at all concerned, as the NEA representative at the
                    General Assembly, about the anti-Israeli attitude displayed by many of the
                    members of the UN?</p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: That was a constant concern. It was not really unique in my experience.
                    Over the years there have been so many situations where the entire United
                    Nations General Assembly would vote one way, and the United States and Israel
                    would vote the other way. It's just sort of a “given” in the United Nations
                    arena that that's the way that United States foreign policy is conducted.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find that this was so much of a constant factor
                        that thway that everybody dealt with this was almost a “pro forma”
                        situation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: A lot of the speeches were expected. As often happened at the United
                    Nations, in those days, the speeches were not directed to the other Delegations
                    in the General Assembly but to audiences back home. That's what the name of the
                    game was so often at the UN, and this frequently remains the case to this day.
                    The speakers are “grandstanding” to audiences back home.</p>
                <p>Q: It's been said that Secretary Rusk was particularly interested in Asia and
                    more or less turned European matters over to Deputy Secretary of State George
                    Ball or somebody else. He also didn't spend a lot of time on Near Eastern
                    questions. Was it evident to you that the Near East wasn't an area of prime
                    interest to Secretary Rusk, from your perspective?</p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: Yes. That was very much my impression. When I had assignments in NEA,
                    involving Turkey and CENTO, Dean Rusk did everything that he did,
                    conscientiously. When he had to talk to an NEA Foreign Minister or go to an NEA
                    post, he did his “home work” and turned in a conscientious job. But NEA was not
                    an abiding concern of his.</p>
                <pb facs="0101" n="Page0101"/>
                <p>Let me just make an aside here. Since we were talking about dealing with CENTO
                    with “mirrors,” this reminds me of a trip I made with Dean Rusk to Ankara for
                    one of those CENTO Council of Ministers' meetings. Incidentally, although we
                    were not a member of CENTO, Dean Rusk was the only Foreign Minister who attended
                    all five meetings of the Council of Ministers. On this particular occasion, this
                    was the 10th anniversary of the establishment of the Baghdad Pact, which, of
                    course, later became CENTO.</p>
                <p>Again playing this with “mirrors,” the various delegations had all agreed that
                    there would be CENTO “Fellowships.” I had somehow contrived to get out of the
                    Washington bureaucracy three such Fellowships for the respective nominees to
                    come to the United States. One Fellowship was awarded to Pakistan, one to
                    Turkey, and one to Iran. On the plane going to Ankara, at a certain point Dean
                    Rusk got out his “Briefing Book” and was going over it with me. When he got to
                    the page about the CENTO Fellowships, he said: “The Atlanta Rotary Club could do
                    better than that!” [Laughter] He was saying how trivial and what a pittance we
                    were putting into the organization.</p>
                <p>Of course he had headed the Ford Foundation for years and knew what grants were.
                    The cost of these Fellowships was probably worth less than a total of $50,000.
                    Q: So you moved over to the Iranian desk in 1966, is that right?</p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you served on the Iranian desk from 1966 to
                        1967.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: Just one year. I worked under Ted Elliott. I was his deputy. We had
                    another officer working on economic affairs. I was working on political
                    affairs.</p>
                <p>Q: What was your impression of how we treated Iran at that time? You already
                    alluded to it before, but now you were back and sort of in “the heart of the
                    beast” in the State Department. What were you getting, from the perspective of
                    the Iranian desk, as far as looking at the Shah, Iran, where things were, and
                    all of that were concerned?</p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: My general impression is that it confirmed many of my surmises about
                    how little thought was given to the details of Iranian policy. On reflection, we
                    were just “transfixed” by dealing with the person of the Shah. Much of my work,
                    as the deputy on the Iranian desk, was simply making sure that the ambassador's
                    recommendations were followed. The ambassador was at the other end of the cable
                    traffic, and that was what the desk had to do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0102" n="Page0102"/>
                <p>NEWBERRY: Armin Meyer. He reminded us daily that we needed to support his
                    relationship with the Shah. That was a major preoccupation. Whenever an Iranian
                    cabinet minister visited the United States, we made a major effort to
                    accommodate him. At one point the Minister at the Court of the Shah, who was
                    probably the Shah's closest, personal friend, decided to visit the U.S. We
                    pulled out all the stops and organized a whole program for him. Then, without
                    giving any warning, he decided that he had something else that he would rather
                    do than follow this program. So for about three days I had to make apologetic
                    phone calls to all of the people who had agreed to see this Iranian cabinet
                    minister. It was an awful lot of non-substantive but important “stagecraft.”
                    That's the kind of thing I thought I was working on when I was on the Iranian
                    desk.</p>
                <p>When the Shah came on one of his many state visits, my chief occupation was
                    dealing with the White House staff, with their endless, “picky” arrangements
                    about the guest list at the big, black tie state banquet. In the end, after
                    working for weeks, getting together the most respectable guest list, in the end,
                    most of the people who were invited to the state dinner were political friends
                    of the President. They had nothing to do with Iran or foreign policy or anything
                    else. I didn't consider my time on the Iranian desk as a very substantive
                    year.</p>
                <p>Q: It also sounds as if you were between two, very “imperious” people: President
                    Lyndon Johnson and the Shah of Iran. Those two personalities sort of dominated
                    your work.</p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: Of course, volumes could be written about the “imperious” President
                    Johnson. I won't go into that except to give you one vignette. When I was
                    preparing for this state visit of the Shah, who, of course, had been to the U.S.
                    on several, previous state visits. The White House staff had decided that
                    President and Mrs. Johnson were tired of the usual “gifts” which the State
                    Department recommended. So I was to come up with an original, imaginative gift
                    list. I was pleased that they liked the suggestions I made.</p>
                <p>One of the things that particularly intrigued them was that we had a report that
                    the Shah had installed his own “bowling alley” at the Imperial Palace in Tehran.
                    It turned out that he and the Empress were both avid bowlers. So I did some
                    research and got the Brunswick bowling ball company to make some special bowling
                    balls and put the imperial crest on them. These special bowling balls were
                    finally delivered to the White House the day before the Shah and the Empress
                    were to arrive. Mrs. Johnson took a look at this gift and said: “That bowling
                    ball is just too big for the Empress!” A member of the White House staff called
                    us and said: “Why did you send such a heavy bowling ball?”</p>
                <pb facs="0103" n="Page0103"/>
                <p>Then I had to “level” with them. I said: “We researched this and had somebody
                    quietly go into the Imperial Palace in Tehran and take the number off the ball.
                    We have our sources of information.” I assured Mrs. Johnson's assistant that
                    this ball was, in fact, the same weight as the Empress of Iran usually plays
                    with. To this day the Empress is a strong, robust woman. She could lift that
                    bowling ball and did. So, with all the last minute tensions before the state
                    visit, I was on the phone to the White House, explaining about the bowling balls
                    to Mrs. Johnson's office. By this time I had spent 15 years in the Foreign
                    Service, and that was what I spent my time doing!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While you were on the Iranian desk, was there any
                        “disquiet” aboupolicy toward the Shah or toward the Shah's policies?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: There was concern but no disposition to pursue thconsequences of our
                    misgivings.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you talk a little about what you were getting from
                        people?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: These concerns were mostly expressed by people returning from serving
                    in Iran or people who made trips to Iran who were aware of the level of
                    discontent and also the abuses of the Shah's regime.</p>
                <p>One of my favorite, and sort of telling reminiscences, concerned an
                    American-educated Iranian. He returned to Iran and did some traveling around.
                    This must have been in the mid-1960s. He later returned to the U.S. and told us:
                    “I was in many places in rural Iran, where there are no doctors or dispensaries.
                    However, there are all of these SAVAK [secret police] agents.” To me that just
                    spoke volumes about what were the priorities of the Shah's regime in terms of
                    taking care of the Iranian people. There were no doctors, dispensaries, or
                    nurses. However, every village had its quota of SAVAK agents.</p>
                <p>Q: Was there any effort made, on our part, to try to pump more assistance, such
                    as the delivery of medical care, out into the countryside? I imagine that one of
                    the real problems was that, as is typical in many countries, including our own,
                    it's very hard to get doctors to work in rural areas.</p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: I'm sure that that's true, right here. If you go 50 or 100 miles from
                    Washington, it's not all that easy to get doctors to go and set up medical
                    practice there. It's worse in countries like Iran and Turkey. I know from
                    personal experience how difficult it is to get professional people to go outside
                    of the big cities.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0104" n="Page0104"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It is very difficult to do.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: It is, indeed. Available, medical care there is very primitive. In Iran
                    medical care was not being delivered in the rural areas. As a matter of fact,
                    schools were among the things that the Shah had managed to do something about.
                    He made it a requirement that young Iranian men who were drafted into the
                    military and who were university educated had to spend a certain amount of time
                    working in the literacy program, teaching villagers how to read and write. We
                    have to give him credit for that. He did some good things.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During this 1966-1967 period, were there any great crises
                        anproblems which occurred, other than with bowling balls?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: They don't spring to mind. There was always this continuing concern
                    about the foreign relations of Iran with Iraq. The Kurdish question was
                    something on which I maintained a watching brief. However, most of my work
                    involved the reading of daily intelligence intercepts. I knew more details about
                    the Kurdish question than I could do anything about, anyway. However, somebody
                    had to read those reports, and that was one of my jobs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the Kurdish problem, as it pertained to Iran?
                        Did whave any particular policy for dealing with it, or anything like
                        that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: Yes. We had our own, clandestine operations going among the Kurds.
                    However, we blew “hot and cold” on what to do about this problem. As long as the
                    Shah was around, we tried to gear our Kurdish policy, how shall I say it, to
                    accord with the policy of the Shah. And the Shah played “games” with the Kurds.
                    This involved making counter-moves against the Kurds who were operating from
                    Iraq. Turkish activities against the Kurds appeared much later on, long years
                    afterwards.</p>
                <p>Q: How was Iraq perceived by the Iranian desk in Washington, from your point of
                    view? Was Iraq regarded as a threat? What was the feeling?</p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: At that time my recollection is that we were more interested in how
                    Baath Party politics were going to work out. The Baath regime in Baghdad was
                    sort of a rival of the Baath regime in Damascus. There was always some
                    fascination with manifestations of the same political doctrine. However, at that
                    time Iraq was not regarded as a threat.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Regarding reporting from Iran, did you feel that there
                        wer“constraints” on it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0105" n="Page0105"/>
                <p>NEWBERRY: They were the same constraints that I described in ouearlier talk.
                    Those constraints were still very much there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a feeling that Ambassador Armin Meyer was sort
                        o“captured” by the Iranian Court?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: No, I think that Ambassador Armin Meyer was a very astute diplomat. He
                    knew what Washington wanted and he conducted himself accordingly. The
                    inspiration for our “coddling” of the Shah came from Washington and not from
                    individual ambassadors.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left the Iranian desk in 1967. Where did you go after
                        that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: I went to replace Monteagle Stearns as Special Assistant tambassador at
                    large Averill Harriman.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you did that from 1967 to 1968.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: Yes, just for one year.</p>
                <p>Q: What were the responsibilities of Averill Harriman as ambassador at large from
                    1967 to 1968? He had had so many positions in the government, dealing with
                    foreign affairs. What was his particular function at this time?</p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: Governor Harriman always liked to be called, “Governor,” because he
                    used to say that this was the only public office that he was ever elected to. So
                    we always called him, “Governor.” Governor Harriman, of course, had supported
                    the election campaign of President John F. Kennedy in 1960. When Kennedy became
                    President, Governor Harriman was appointed Undersecretary of State, I think.
                    Anyway, he had a succession of jobs in the State Department. By the time I went
                    to work for him, President Kennedy had been killed, and Lyndon Johnson was
                    President. Averill Harriman, to whom the Democratic Party owed a great deal,
                    financial and otherwise, was kept on in office.</p>
                <pb facs="0106" n="Page0106"/>
                <p>By this time he was 75 years old, which is my own age. I think that I could
                    function as well as Governor Harriman did, if I had his resources. However, the
                    general attitude toward Harriman among people around Washington was that he was
                    just being “tolerated” and was just an old “leftover” from the earlier days. He
                    had been Secretary of Commerce, ambassador to the Soviet Union, ambassador to
                    Britain, and so forth, under earlier administrations. By 1966 he was 75 years
                    old and had been given the position of ambassador at large. Governor Harriman
                    could be interested in anything that you wanted him to do. However, he had a
                    “special portfolio” to pursue the question of American prisoners of war who had
                    been captured during the Vietnam War.</p>
                <p>My particular function for him was to read the cables and “screen” reporting from
                    Vietnam so that he could be “up to date” and participate in higher level
                    councils of the government with the latest, telegraphic traffic. The wives of
                    prisoners of war were encouraged to keep in touch with Governor Harriman,
                    although there wasn't very much that we could tell them. I became a sort of
                    “listening box” with these wives. I had many interesting conversations with
                    them. I came to “take the measure” of the remarkable wife of Admiral Stockdale.
                    Sybil Stockdale sort of “organized” all of the West Coast POW wives. She would
                    call me up from time to time, just to get as much information as she could,
                    which was very little, in fact.</p>
                <p>It stands out in my memory that her husband was Captain Stockdale, when he was
                    captured by the North Vietnamese. He was later promoted to rear admiral before
                    he retired and became a candidate for Vice President with Ross Perot in the
                    elections of 1992. However, at the time of which we are speaking, the Stockdales
                    were much younger. Mrs. Stockdale was an extraordinarily talented organizer and,
                    how shall I say it, sensitive listener. I regarded the discussions with her as
                    among the most interesting experiences that I had when I was working for
                    Governor Harriman, staying in touch with the wives of the POWs through Mrs.
                    Stockdale.</p>
                <p>Q: The relatives of the Vietnam prisoners of war are still a potent, political
                    organization, even today. My perception is that this group of people has become
                    a sort of “Right Wing” organization which holds the view that, “The government
                    doesn't do anything for us.” We still see “missing in action” flags and banners,
                    and all of that. Was there anything of that nature at this time, or was this a
                    practical organization devoted to the question of what we are going to do about
                    the status of the POWs?</p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: The question was, indeed, what we are going to do about their status.
                    At the height of the Vietnam War, we had very little information. We didn't even
                    know where the prisoners were being held, in most cases, except in the case of
                    prisoners held in Cambodia, and we'll come to that. I have a very important
                    message to convey on that subject.</p>
                <pb facs="0107" n="Page0107"/>
                <p>We really didn't know very much about the status of the POWs. My job really was
                    to give the wives of the POWs some feeling that the U.S. government really
                    “cared” about their husbands. There just wasn't much information available, but
                    I have to say that I have not kept up with that subject. My career took me on to
                    other matters. I have not been in recent touch with any of these prisoner of war
                    organizations.</p>
                <p>Q: How much attention did you feel that both the U.S. military and the CIA and
                    other intelligence organizations paid to this issue during this time?</p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: Of course, at this time I was in the frustrating position of trying to
                    get answers for these wives of the POWs and was unable to get any. I had the
                    feeling that we weren't doing as much as we could have, but the Vietnam War
                    effort was so enormous and so vast that I would not want to be in the position
                    of saying that we could have done more. I knew also that we had so many other
                    things that our resources were being devoted to. I would not want to make an
                    individual judgment on that matter.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At this particular time what was your impression of how
                        GovernoHarriman operated, as you saw it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: I remember that Joseph Kraft, the columnist, wrote a profile of
                    Governor Harriman at that time. It struck me that it made a very good evaluation
                    of Harriman. Kraft said that, “Averill Harriman is the only ambitious, 75 year
                    old” that he had ever met. Harriman was still trying to “get into the act,”
                    still looking for a role to play. In fact, he had a symbolic role to play
                    because he went off to Paris when the long-enduring peace talks with North
                    Vietnam began. Harriman went as the ostensible chairman of our Delegation to the
                    talks. However, he was “backed up” by Cyrus Vance, who was the real negotiator.
                    Harriman had enough “clout” in Washington that he was able to go to Paris, open
                    the peace talks, and participate in them. Nobody expected him to be the real
                    negotiator. People spoke of “Harriman and Vance.”</p>
                <p>That was a mess because so much of what he was doing was trying to find a role to
                    play. After all of the honors that he had gained, he was still looking for more.
                    As his Special Assistant, I found that I also had to look out for social
                    opportunities for him. Get him on the White House guest list for things that you
                    wouldn't expect Harriman to be interested in. He wanted to be “seen” in these
                    circles. That was very important to him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did Pamela Harriman play any role in your work at
                        all?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0108" n="Page0108"/>
                <p>NEWBERRY: At that time Marie Harriman was still alive. She was Governor
                    Harriman's wife and she died back in the 1970s. Pamela Harriman married the
                    Governor much later after I had left his service. I never met her until after
                    Governor Harriman had died. So I did not know Pamela Harriman well but I knew
                    Marie Harriman. She was a very distinguished lady and a gracious hostess, as
                    well as an art connoisseur. She had been running her own art gallery in New York
                    when Governor Harriman met and courted her. They had a very gracious home in the
                    Georgetown district of Washington. That was where Jacqueline Kennedy, President
                    John F. Kennedy's widow, lived after the President was assassinated.</p>
                <p>This brings me to something that I would like to put into this Oral History
                    because I don't think that it's ever been recorded before. When I was working
                    for Governor Harriman, Mrs. John F. Kennedy was still Mrs. John F. Kennedy. She
                    got a lot of attention from the news media. Every time she went out to dinner
                    with any man, he was the focus of considerable speculation. At this point in my
                    story, when I was working for Governor Harriman, Lord Harlech, the former
                    British ambassador to the United States, was regarded as the principal suitor of
                    the widow of President Kennedy in all the tabloid magazines.</p>
                <p>Well, all of this is related, as I mentioned some time ago, to Cambodia. We had
                    no diplomatic relations with Cambodia at that time. We had broken relations with
                    Cambodia, and the Australian government “protected the interests” of the United
                    States in Cambodia. I've forgotten who protected Cambodian interests in
                    Washington but I never had anything to do with them. However, the Australian
                    embassy used to bring messages to the State Department, since Australia
                    protected “U.S. interests” in Cambodia. On this occasion the Australian first
                    secretary brought me an envelope.</p>
                <p>This was one of the most stupid “blunders” that I ever made in my career. He had
                    a message from the Australian High Commission in London, addressed to Mrs.
                    Kennedy. I received this envelope automatically and, without thinking, opened it
                    up. Well, much to my astonishment, as I had not known that all of this was going
                    on, Jackie Kennedy had decided that she wanted to visit Angkor Wat, in Cambodia.
                    Some famous French scholar had told her that she should see it. So never mind
                    that the U.S. had no relations with Cambodia and that the Viet Cong had captured
                    some of our people and taken them into Cambodia. They were holding American
                    “prisoners of war” inside Cambodia. Jackie Kennedy just decided that she wanted
                    to go to Angkor Wat and that she wanted to go NOW.</p>
                <pb facs="0109" n="Page0109"/>
                <p>I really caught “hell” from Governor Harriman for having opened the letter
                    addressed to her. Well, I was the Special Assistant to Governor Harriman and I
                    opened mail addressed to the Governor. The letter turned out to be an invitation
                    to Mrs. Kennedy from Prince Sihanouk of Cambodia. The letter had been forwarded
                    to Governor Harriman who, I guess, knew Mrs. Kennedy pretty well. Governor
                    Harriman said to me: “I don't know what possessed you to open that letter!”
                    However, I could tell from his tone of voice that he was very glad to know what
                    was in the letter, because it alerted him to what problems he had to face. Of
                    course, Mrs. Kennedy's first reaction was one of surprise that a Special
                    Assistant could listen to phone calls for Governor Harriman. As a matter of
                    fact, like all Special Assistants in the State Department, I was expected to
                    listen in on the Governor's phone calls. When I did so, Governor Harriman was
                    very proper. He told me: “You're a Foreign Service officer, and when I'm talking
                    about Democratic Party politics, you are not to listen.” He wanted to keep me
                    absolutely clear of such matters.</p>
                <p>Anyway, Mrs. Kennedy's reaction when she found that the letter addressed to her
                    had been opened was to say to Governor Harriman: “Averill, suppose that that
                    letter had been a 'tender' avowal from Prince Sihanouk.” Of course, Prince
                    Sihanouk was married and so forth. So this was the beginning of my, how shall I
                    say, disillusionment with the “Camelot” image of the widow Kennedy.</p>
                <p>However, to compress this story, one of the things I had to consider was how to
                    get Mrs. Kennedy to Cambodia. Of course, it was a simple enough thing to arrange
                    for commercial transportation for her and Lord Harlech as far as Bangkok. But
                    there was no way to get them from Bangkok to Phnom Penh and thence to Siem Reap,
                    where Angkor Wat is located.So Averill Harriman and Bob McNamara, who was the
                    Secretary of Defense at that time, spoke on the phone to each other, and I
                    listened in. It was very revealing. Neither one of them wanted to pick up the
                    phone and call Mrs. Kennedy. McNamara said: “Averill, you call her.” Governor
                    Harriman said: “No, Bob, I think that on this one you should call her.”
                    [Laughter] It was obvious that they dreaded having to talk to Mrs. Kennedy.</p>
                <p>However, in the end what was arranged was that, to justify using a U.S. military
                    aircraft to fly Mrs. Kennedy and her entourage from Bangkok to Phnom Penh, they
                    had to “cook up” a mission for her. So it was agreed by Mrs. Kennedy with
                    Secretary of Defense McNamara that, while she was in Cambodia, she would
                    intervene personally with Prince Sihanouk to do something about getting our
                    prisoners of war released from Cambodia to somewhere and somehow do something
                    for the American prisoners of war held by the Viet Cong in Cambodia.</p>
                <pb facs="0110" n="Page0110"/>
                <p>So the whole visit of Mrs. Kennedy to Cambodia unrolled, and it got to be a big
                    “hullabaloo.” At one, “horrible” moment I thought that I was going to have to go
                    with her. Governor Harriman said: “We can't just let her go alone with Lord
                    Harlech. That would cause a lot of gossip. We've got to find another man.” I
                    protested: “But Governor, I'm married.” Harriman said: “But you speak French.” I
                    kept saying: “But I'm married.” So, in the end they got Michael Forrestal, the
                    son of the late James V. Forrestal [the first Secretary of Defense], who was a
                    very eligible bachelor and who had escorted Mrs. Kennedy on social occasions.
                    Mike Forrestal, who had served in the government, went along on this trip. It
                    was fortunate, from our point of view in the State Department that Mike
                    Forrestal did go along, because he was a “trained observer” and he was the only
                    source of information as to what actually went on during Mrs. Kennedy's “state
                    visit” to Cambodia, a country with which we had no diplomatic relations.</p>
                <p>Well, the visit took place, and Prince Sihanouk pulled out all of the “stops.” As
                    the visit was coming to an end, Mike Forrestal reminded Mrs. Kennedy about her
                    commitment to ask Prince Sihanouk for help in arranging the release of American
                    prisoners of war. At this point Mrs. Kennedy had still not brought up the
                    subject, in spite of repeated reminders. In the end Mike Forrestal himself had
                    to bring up the subject with Prince Sihanouk. Of course, the whole “magic” of
                    her proposed intervention was gone.</p>
                <p>I tell this story because I think that it reveals something about Mrs. Kennedy
                    and her single-mindedness that she couldn't be bothered to mention the American
                    prisoners of war during all of that “glamorous” experience, in spite of her, how
                    shall I say it, her “chef de cabinet” [principal aide, in this case Mike
                    Forrestal] reminding her of the prisoners of war at every step during the visit
                    to Cambodia.</p>
                <p>Somehow or other, I've never been able to shake this impression from my mind. I
                    don't think that it's ever been recorded anywhere. That's why I've gone to so
                    much trouble to tell this story in this interview. I am an “ear witness” to all
                    of this.</p>
                <p>Q: It's very interesting that Mike Forrestal, in what is known in social terms as
                    “going as the beard,” was the “other person” when there was a romantic liaison
                    going on. This term is used when you bring another party into the proceedings to
                    dissipate the appearances of any “impropriety.”</p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: Well, that's a story all unto itself.</p>
                <p>Q: What was the reaction, particularly within the White House staff, to your
                    efforts to have Governor Harriman included on guest lists for state functions?
                    Did you find a sympathetic reaction there? Did they say: “Oh, my God! We've got
                    to do something for him.”</p>
                <pb facs="0111" n="Page0111"/>
                <p>NEWBERRY: They usually “rolled with the punch.” I must say that it wasn't
                    regarded as a terribly small scale matter and that I had raised it too late.
                    They would try to include him. I would say that Governor Harriman was
                    “tolerated” at the White House, rather than really “treasured.” However, there
                    came a time, when I was still working for Governor Harriman, and the whole
                    national sentiment was beginning to change about the Vietnam War, and President
                    Lyndon Johnson was finally persuaded to bring together a group of senior
                    statesmen, known as the “wise men,” including Clark Clifford and...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was after the “Tet” offensive, which began in
                        January, 1968.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: Governor Harriman, who was always very sensitive to these things, of
                    course took part in this group. I could sense the “shift” in his views, although
                    I was not present. I knew that something had happened. Harriman, McNamara, and
                    company were all beginning to look for ways to shift their positions on the
                    Vietnam War, because it was obvious that President Johnson had been persuaded
                    that he had to change the whole approach. That's when we began talking about the
                    Paris Peace Talks, and so forth. In my perception of it, the experience with the
                    group of “Wise Men” was decisive. I think that Dean Acheson also took part in
                    these discussions. They persuaded President Johnson that he had to change his
                    position on the war.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you left Governor Harriman's staff in 1968.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: Yes. At this point Governor Harriman was going to Paris to participate
                    in the peace talks. He didn't need me and, as luck would have it, I got an
                    assignment to attend the Army War College for a year as a student in the class
                    of 1969. So it was just a perfect “parting of the ways” with Governor Harriman.
                    The Governor went to Paris, and I went to Carlisle Barracks, Pennsylvania, for a
                    year.</p>
                <p>Q: Could you talk a bit about your time at the Army War College? You were there
                    from September, 1968 to June, 1969. Could you give us your impressions of the
                    War College and what you got out of that year? What was your impression of the
                    U.S. military? This was really at the height of the Vietnam War and all that.
                    What was the atmosphere?</p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: It certainly was the “height” or the “depth” of the Vietnam War. First,
                    let me say that the year I spent at the Army War College, living on the post
                    with my family, was a surprisingly agreeable experience, personally. My wife and
                    I found that we had far more in common with the colonels and “honorary colonels”
                    in the class than we expected. Most of my classmates were Army colonels. We
                    found that we had much more in common than what separated us. This was a great
                    revelation to me. Some of my War College classmates are close friends of ours to
                    this day. Other State Department colleagues who have been to one of the war
                    colleges have told me the same thing.</p>
                <pb facs="0112" n="Page0112"/>
                <p>From the personal point of view, it's a great revelation to have this intimate,
                    day to day sense of a common mission, shall we say, and a common commitment with
                    our military colleagues. That was an important, personal experience.</p>
                <p>As far as Vietnam is concerned, as it happened, in 1968 General Westmoreland, the
                    famous General “Westy,” had just been pulled out of Vietnam to become the Chief
                    of Staff of the U.S. Army. The tradition at the Army War College is that the
                    first lecture of the student year, in the fall, is given by the Army Chief of
                    Staff. So General Westmoreland gave the first lecture. This has a very important
                    bearing on my experience at the war college, which I will explain now.</p>
                <p>You may remember that during the Vietnam War, General Westmoreland had a “running
                    battle” with the press. He had lots of complaints about the “malign influence”
                    of press reporting on the Vietnam War. So in his inaugural lecture at the Army
                    War College General Westmoreland expressed the hope that several of the officers
                    in the class would devote their student thesis time to analyzing the impact of
                    press reporting on the conduct of military operations.</p>
                <p>When the time came to propose our thesis topic, I proposed something else. I was
                    called in by the Director of Instruction, who said: “Dan, we know that you've
                    been a press officer. You heard what General Westmoreland said. What are you
                    going to write about the Vietnam War?” I said: “Well, the general just made this
                    as a suggestion.” The director of instruction said: “You should understand this,
                    Mr. Newberry, that Army officers have been court martialed for not carrying out
                    the suggestion of a general officer.”</p>
                <p>So what was I to do? I did not want to write about the Vietnam War. I came up
                    with a proposal to do my research and write my Army War College thesis on the
                    relationship between the Department of Defense Public Affairs Bureau at the
                    Pentagon and the Pentagon press corps, right here in Washington. I knew that
                    most of the press reporting was “decentralized” and written out in Saigon. The
                    Army War College approved this thesis as meeting the “requirement.”</p>
                <p>This turned out to be a fascinating experience during my [year] at the Army War
                    College. All of the members of the class were allowed every Wednesday off, for a
                    period of about 10 weeks, to do research. They provided me with a car and driver
                    to take me down to Washington once a week to do my research. I spent a lot of
                    time in the Pentagon, and also in the State Department, doing an analysis on how
                    the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs was
                    organized to handle public affairs. In fact, it was abysmally organized. There
                    were the worst relations, marked by constant “bickering,” between OASD/Public
                    Affairs and the Pentagon press corps.</p>
                <pb facs="0113" n="Page0113"/>
                <p>I found that the irony of it, as I pursued my research, was that the regular
                    members of the Pentagon press corps, including some of the most respected
                    “by-lines,” were amongst the most critical of the “control mechanism” that had
                    been put into place during the Secretary of Defense McNamara regime. They felt
                    that this mechanism, in effect, amounted to “censorship.” I brought out in my
                    dissertation that in many respects McNamara's regime and the people that he had
                    in public affairs represented the “triumph” of civilian control over the
                    military. However, the people who could be counted on to carry out the
                    instructions were all of the military people from the Army, Navy, and Air Force
                    who were “seconded” to this Bureau of Public Affairs; they were making this
                    regime work. They carried out orders. Here we were, with the apparent triumph of
                    civilian control over the military. In fact, this was an example of the most
                    thoroughgoing censorship and dissembling. The Pentagon correspondents hated this
                    system. I assembled a whole catalogue of complaints to this effect.</p>
                <p>To mitigate this view, in my thesis I did a comparison with the way the State
                    Department handled public affairs during the Vietnam War. Although we, both then
                    and even now, have our “hangups” about dealing with the press, we did fairly
                    well. This was during the time Bob McCloskey was Assistant Secretary of State
                    for Public Affairs. He has since died, but we remember him as being an
                    exceptionally effective spokesman for the State Department.</p>
                <p>In my thesis I made a comparison between the two, public affairs operations in
                    the Pentagon and in the Department of State. I also made an analysis of what the
                    hangups of the State Department people were and how they affected the situation.
                    If anybody wants to do some research on my paper, it is available through the
                    Army War College. The title of it is: “The Defense Department and Relations with
                    the Pentagon Press Corps,” published in 1968 at the Army War College.</p>
                <p>I won't dwell on that any more, except that, to go back to the Vietnam War, in
                    the course of my final, roundup interviews, I couldn't see the Assistant
                    Secretary for Public Affairs at the Defense Department, but I saw his Deputy who
                    was handling public affairs. This Deputy was himself a former newspaperman. I
                    regarded him almost as a “renegade,” because he was part of what I regarded as a
                    “censorship” operation, too.</p>
                <p>At this point I was developing the conclusions to my research. I said to the
                    Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs: “I have been impressed
                    with what a splendid organization and how well equipped the Pentagon and the
                    Department of Defense are in supplying all of this information. Why is it that
                    the Department of Defense did not try to explain to the American public what we
                    were doing in Vietnam?” The reply of this Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense
                    for Public Affairs was: “If we did that, Newberry, the American people might get
                    to 'like' the Vietnam War, and that would close off the President's options.” I
                    can tell you that this remark almost made me sick to my stomach. That's all I
                    have to say on this subject.</p>
                <pb facs="0114" n="Page0114"/>
                <p>Q: Did you sense within the Army officer corps any “disquiet” about Vietnam and
                    what we were doing? You are really talking about the people who were fighting
                    the war.</p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: Absolutely. We had many, free-ranging discussions among the members of
                    the class, who were mostly colonels. Many of them were terribly disturbed about
                    the whole concept of the war, the way it was being waged, and the professional
                    mistakes that were being made. Incidentally, in retrospect one of the most
                    revealing things that came to my attention was that toward the end of the year
                    at the Army War College several officers from the National Guard spent several
                    days with us. We met with them and had discussions with them.</p>
                <p>One of these officers was the General who commanded the Ohio National Guard. He
                    was “terrified” that many of the members of the class appeared to be such “free
                    thinkers.” Many of our classmates commented after the “bull sessions” with him
                    were over: “That man is 'dangerous.'” In fact, he was the officer who later
                    conducted the operation to restore order at Kent State University in 1970.</p>
                <p>Q: This conversation with the commander of the Ohio National Guard was in the
                    spring of 1968. It was the Ohio National Guard that fired on students at Kent
                    State University in 1970. This really “tipped the balance” in the U.S. anti-war
                    movement.</p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: My reason for mentioning this is that the Army officers in my class who
                    heard this general recognized him as “dangerous” and commented to this effect
                    among ourselves. Sure enough, he was. The Kent State University clash between
                    university students and National Guardsmen was a very important event in the
                    whole drama of the Vietnam War.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Absolutely. In 1969 you left the Army War College. Where
                        did yogo?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: I would like to refer back to the personnel assignment process in the
                    State Department. I might add and take advantage of this opportunity to “brag”
                    about myself a bit. Members of the war college faculty told me that my thesis on
                    Defense Department relations with the Pentagon press corps received the highest
                    grade of the various theses prepared by my class. In fact, they said that they
                    had never given such a high grade to a thesis by one of the students. They
                    incorporated my paper in the war college curriculum for the next several years
                    as “required reading” for the ensuing classes. I felt that I came out of my war
                    college year with a great deal of prestige.</p>
                <pb facs="0115" n="Page0115"/>
                <p>However, the State Department paid no attention to this. When it came time to
                    inquire about my onward assignment, the personnel people gave me two choices:
                    one was to be principal officer in the consulate in Peshawar, Pakistan; the
                    other was to go back to Turkey as the principal officer in Adana, Turkey. I
                    didn't have much trouble making a choice between these two possibilities. I
                    found that in Peshawar, Pakistan, the only place where my children could go to
                    school in English was the Pakistani Air Force School for Dependents. They would
                    be the only non-Pakistani children in the school. So it didn't take me long to
                    decide to go back to Turkey as principal officer at the American consulate in
                    Adana.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you went to Adana, Turkey. You were there from when to
                        when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: From August, 1969, to August, 1971.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were, what, consul general?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: I was consul.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation in Adana? How do you pronounce
                        it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: Actually, most people who speak English call it Adana, witthe stress on
                    the second “a.”</p>
                <p>Q: Could you describe the consulate there at that time? That is, its
                    responsibilities and the principal matters that you were dealing with there?</p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: I got the clear impression, and I knew this from my previous time on
                    the Turkish desk in the 1950s, that a decision had been made to move the
                    American consulate from Iskenderun [also called “Alexandretta”], where it had
                    been for many years, down near the Syrian border, to Adana. Near Adana was a
                    Turkish Air Force Base, which was to be jointly operated by the Turkish and the
                    U.S. Air Forces. The base was being developed at Incerlik. In fact, the U.S. Air
                    Force “ran” the base, with the participation of the Turkish Air Force. All
                    concerned had decided that the American consulate in that area should be close
                    to Incerlik, since there were very good, relations between the U.S. Air Force
                    and the local, Turkish community.</p>
                <pb facs="0116" n="Page0116"/>
                <p>So the principal function for the American consulate in Adana was to ensure good,
                    community relations between the U.S. Air Force people and the Turkish community.
                    However, of course, we had other, traditional consular responsibilities. The
                    consular district covered 18 provinces in southeastern Turkey. We had relatively
                    meager, personnel resources. We had myself as consul, vice consul Mike Austrian,
                    an American secretary, and four or five Turkish employees [Foreign Service
                    Nationals].</p>
                <p>We did a pretty thorough job of getting around a relatively large, consular
                    district but we couldn't do all of that much “in depth” reporting. By that time,
                    although I was reasonably good in conversational Turkish, my vice consul, Mike
                    Austrian, spoke Turkish better than I did. When we made field trips, although we
                    took interpreters with us, I think that we did a reasonably good job of
                    reporting on political and economic matters.</p>
                <p>However, we were basically concerned about the Air Base at Incerlik. We tried to
                    ensure that the U.S. Air Force personnel at Incerlik understood what the
                    problems were. One of the biggest of these problems, which Mike Austrian and I
                    had to deal with, involved the trade union situation at the air base, which
                    constituted one of the anomalies in the Turkish political situation. This is
                    still an anomaly, to a certain extent.</p>
                <p>The irony is that, back in the 1950s, I was involved in trade union problems
                    during my first tour of duty in Turkey. The American Federation of Labor had a
                    “missionary” out in Turkey. In fact, he was a trade union organizer. He was not
                    particularly welcome in Turkey as he was teaching the Turks how to organize
                    labor unions. So this whole phenomenon of Turkish labor unions and their
                    militancy was something which the American labor movement had introduced into
                    Turkey.</p>
                <p>When I got to Adana in 1969, a strike was going on at the air force base at
                    Incerlik. There was a nationwide union in Turkey which organized the military
                    base workers, called the “Defense Workers' Union.” The union members were on
                    strike and demonstrating outside Incerlik Air Force Base at this time.</p>
                <p>The strike didn't extend to the air base itself, but the union had pickets
                    outside the main gates. There was an astonishing atmosphere inside the base
                    about the attitude toward the Turkish strikers, who were carrying placards and
                    so forth outside the base. It came home to me that an awful lot of American
                    adults had grown up without any understanding of the history of the trade union
                    movement in the United States, as well as the contributions of the trade unions
                    to the life and prosperity of America. The U.S. Air Force people at the base in
                    Incerlik had the attitude that those Turkish workers were like the “Viet Cong”
                    out there, waiting to do “mischief.” These Air Force personnel had absolutely no
                    understanding of the rights of labor to organize and to make their grievances
                    heard.</p>
                <pb facs="0117" n="Page0117"/>
                <p>So I found myself, as the American consul, trying gently to persuade my own
                    countrymen in the U.S. Air Force to understand what trade union rights were. It
                    was as basic as that.</p>
                <p>Q: How did you go about persuading the U.S. Air Force base commander and his
                    officers to understand the role of trade unions and, particularly, the attitude
                    of the Turkish strikers?</p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: Well, we only had partial success because, as at most military
                    installations, and particularly at our base facilities, there is a constant
                    turnover of people. I found during my time at Incerlik that I was constantly
                    having to go over the same ground with newly-arrived colonels, majors, and so
                    forth, coming in from God knows where. I should add that this strike was
                    eventually resolved. However, these Air Force officers really didn't want to
                    deal with the trade unions.</p>
                <p>I found that, in general, one of the biggest problems that we had was
                    psychological. One of my colleagues told me that in the U.S. Air Force, when you
                    go from one base to another around the world, everything is provided for you,
                    including the PX, the Commissary, the movie theaters, and so forth. So an air
                    base is an air base is an air base. A lot of the U.S. Air Force people were
                    really not interested in community relations with the Turks. They could walk
                    down the road, outside the base, to a little, makeshift colony of souvenir
                    stalls and buy anything Turkish that they wanted, without even going into the
                    city of Adana. In fact, many of the U.S. Air Force people didn't go into Adana
                    at all.</p>
                <p>We had an uphill struggle. We made some progress and we kept trying. There was a
                    very lively Turkish-American binational association. Some of the more purposeful
                    U.S. Air Force people would come into town and take part in the activities of
                    the binational association. However, they were a small minority out of the
                    couple of thousand U.S. Air Force personnel assigned to the base. There was a
                    very large, American community living inside the base. Some of them were
                    actually quartered in the city of Adana, by choice, especially those who had
                    “unaccompanied tours of duty.” Some of them brought their families to Turkey at
                    their own expense and rented quarters in Adana. I don't want to paint an
                    absolutely bleak picture, because there were some purposeful people among the
                    U.S. Air Force personnel assigned to the air base at Incerlik who went out and
                    learned and saw something of Turkey. However, for the most part, U.S. Air Force
                    personnel would just as soon have had nothing to do with the Turks.</p>
                <p>In some ways, if there were little or no contact with the Turks, this would
                    facilitate our community relations problem. However, on the other hand, it was a
                    challenge to “juggle” these considerations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have the problem of automobile accidents,
                        drinking, peoplgoing into mosques, and that sort of thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0118" n="Page0118"/>
                <p>NEWBERRY: I think that as far as the issue of Americans going into mosques was
                    concerned, they had pretty good briefings. We never had any problem with that.
                    Automobile accidents were another matter. Since Incerlik air base was in a
                    rural, agricultural community, a lot of really terrible traffic accidents
                    occurred with farm carts which circulated at night or in the late dusk, with no
                    markings or lights on them. We had lots of really serious problems with Air
                    Force drivers who, in spite of briefings, unfortunately had some fatal
                    accidents. The driving habits of Americans and the village folkways of Turks and
                    their tractors and tractor-trailers were a constant problem. This was one of our
                    biggest community difficulties.</p>
                <p>Of course, we had the “Status of Forces” agreement, under which the American
                    military could simply declare that, in the event of an accident involving an Air
                    Force vehicle, the Air Force driver was on duty, in which case he could not be
                    touched by a Turkish court. Still, this created a dreadful, community relations
                    problem. This was one which the U.S. Air Force worked on all the time and made a
                    very serious effort to deal with. However, with that many people, many of the
                    airmen had their own cars which were brought out to Turkey or were flown out
                    from the United States, there was lots of driving around. There were beautiful,
                    excursion places for picnics in the mountains around Adana. There was a lot of
                    traffic on the roads, and eventually we had lots of problems on that score.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, how did you interrelate with the Turkish authorities
                        in tharea?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: The Governor of the Province and the Mayor of the city of Adana were my
                    principal contacts. I took great pains to stay on good terms with the Turkish
                    military in the VI Corps of the Turkish Army, which was based there. We were
                    very mindful that there were lots of Turkish military in that part of Turkey. We
                    used to say that they were rehearsing for the invasion of Cyprus. It was very
                    obvious to us what they were doing. However, by that time I knew a good bit
                    about the Turkish military. I knew that if I asked too many questions, they
                    would just tell me to mind my own business. So vice consul Mike Austrian and I
                    just took note of these things and recorded them. However, we did not get into
                    any operational discussions with the Turkish military.</p>
                <p>As it turned out, preparing for the invasion of Cyprus was exactly what the VI
                    Corps of the Turkish Army was doing, when we were there. There was always a lot
                    of military activity on the roads. I just kept up “correct relations” and very
                    cordial relations with the Turkish military. I've always found the Turkish
                    military to be courteous and polite, even when they had a stern message to
                    deliver.</p>
                <pb facs="0119" n="Page0119"/>
                <p>On one occasion, a Peace Corps alumnus who was employed as the director of the
                    Turkish-American Association Center, had gone out of his way to be hospitable to
                    young, “drifting Americans” who came through the area. On numerous occasions he
                    allowed them to stay in his apartment. Some of these “drifters” were stashing
                    drugs in his apartment. This came to the attention of the Turkish police, and
                    the former Peace Corps volunteer was arrested. By this time Turkey was under
                    martial law. I went down to see the martial law commander, who was responsible
                    for dealing with this matter. I went down to see what I could do to make sure
                    that this young American was not unduly punished for allowing some of these
                    “drifters” to use his house to store drugs.</p>
                <p>I'll never forget the very stern but friendly lecture that the commanding officer
                    of the VI Turkish Army Corps, a three-star Turkish general gave to me. He said:
                    “Mr. Consul, the job of being director of the Turkish-American Association is a
                    serious job, and it should have a serious person in that job.” That's all he had
                    to say. On the other hand, he did the necessary. He got the message from me.
                    They preferred no charges against the young man. However, the young man had been
                    thoroughly sobered by this experience. He never let anybody else stay in his
                    apartment, “drifters” or otherwise.</p>
                <p>I mention this story because it shows the care which the Turkish military
                    exercised in their relations with us. They were firm but courteous and
                    friendly.</p>
                <p>Q: Speaking of these American “drifters,” during part of this time, from 1970 to
                    1974, I was consul general in Athens. This was a period when an awful lot of
                    young Americans were going into Turkey, Pakistan, Afghanistan, and so forth,
                    picking up hashish, and trying to smuggle it out. I'm not talking about “big
                    time” drug dealers. Mostly, it was young people doing this. Did you have a
                    problem with this kind of thing?</p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: Not a big problem. Of course, in Istanbul it was a huge problem. Most
                    of the “drifters” got no farther than Istanbul because it was an easy, open
                    scene in those days. There were stories written and even a movie shot about
                    them. However, very few of these “drifters” strayed as far South and East in
                    Turkey as Adana. So we just got an occasional one.</p>
                <p>Q: I think that we may have talked about this before. I am referring to some
                    young, American women who were arrested for having a van full of hashish. Were
                    they still in jail when you were in Adana, or did that happen later?</p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: That did not happen when I was in Adana. It happened during the time
                    Bill Hallman was consul in Adana. Actually, when I was principal officer in
                    Adana, we only had one American citizen, a civilian, in jail. Of course, the
                    U.S. military took care of their people. Bill Hallman, my successor, had a
                    different experience.</p>
                <pb facs="0120" n="Page0120"/>
                <p>Q: Part of my responsibility as consul general in Athens during this time was
                    that I had a representative to handle federal benefits in Turkey and other
                    things. We used to send our people out to investigate in Turkey, and they would
                    come back with great stories. I wonder if you could explain what Federal
                    benefits in Turkey were and your impression of what was happening in your
                    consular district.</p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: This was a very specialized, localized situation. To explain how this
                    came about, you have to go back to World War I. We used to call this man the
                    “Social Security Attache in Athens.” He would come over once a year to inspect
                    the situation. Thanks to the missionaries in that part of Turkey, a lot of their
                    proteges got jobs in war production plants in the United States, especially in
                    Michigan. Many of them stayed on in the United States after World War I was
                    over, long enough to build up eligibility for Social Security pensions. Then
                    they came back to their villages out in eastern Turkey, especially in the
                    province of Elazi_.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Elazi_ was in your...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: It was in the Adana consular district. Actually, it took about an eight
                    hours' drive to get out there. I'll try to shorten this story, but what happened
                    was that these people came back to their villages and had children, who were
                    entitled to Social Security Survivors' benefits. Even in my time in Adana, in
                    1969-1971, there was still a substantial number of monthly Social Security
                    checks that had to be disbursed. However, there was an enterprising villager out
                    there in Elazi_ who had contrived to adopt a number of these people legally. He
                    was siphoning off the Social Security checks for himself. This had all happened
                    before my time in Adana.</p>
                <p>It was such a scandal that the Social Security Administration had decided that
                    the American consul in Adana had to distribute these survivors' checks
                    personally every month. We had a position in the Consulate which had been funded
                    by the Social Security Administration. One of our local employees went out to
                    Elazi_ Province to distribute these Social Security checks. I went with him a
                    couple of times because I wanted to see the situation in person, and so did vice
                    consul Mike Austrian. The Social Security attache in Athens would come out and
                    inspect this situation once a year because of the extensive “fraud” that had
                    gone on. There were still attempts being made to continue the fraud.</p>
                <p>We had set up special accounts in the local bank in Elazi_ for these people, so
                    that “shysters” couldn't get hold of their money. However, we had to check up
                    constantly to make sure that the people eligible for these checks were still
                    alive. This was a very time-consuming process and, for all I know, it still goes
                    on. I don't know any other place in the world where such an elaborate system has
                    been set up. This was because of the extensive fraud that was perpetrated, years
                    before.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0121" n="Page0121"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find that the Turkish authorities were helpful in
                        trying to end this fraud?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: Yes. Once the fraud was discovered, they cooperated completely. They
                    didn't like anybody engaging in such activity. We set up special accounts in a
                    government bank which, I think, is now being “privatized.” In those days it was
                    a government bank. We had full cooperation from the bank.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the cultivation of opium poppies and that sort
                        othing? Was this much of a problem in your area?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: Not in my area. The principal province for the cultivation of opium
                    poppies was in the consular district of the consulate in Izmir. This problem was
                    very much on the agenda during that period. I think that I once remarked that
                    when Bill Handley was our ambassador in Ankara from 1969 to 1972, I don't think
                    that there was a single day during his mission to Turkey that he didn't have to
                    deal with the subject of opium. This was not a problem in my consular district.
                    I was very much aware of the problem because, of course, I read all of the cable
                    traffic that was repeated to me from the embassy in Ankara. I knew how much the
                    U.S. government was concerned about opium.</p>
                <p>This was a period when President Nixon had placed great emphasis on stamping out
                    the opium and narcotics traffic. There was a lot of illicit cultivation of opium
                    poppies in Turkey during this time. In the end we obtained the cooperation of
                    the Turkish government, to the point that there was virtually no “illicit”
                    cultivation of opium poppies. There is “licensed” cultivation of opium poppies,
                    because the Turkish government produces its own narcotics for medicinal
                    purposes. This is very much under control, mainly because of our pressure and
                    our willingness to assist the Turkish authorities to find crop replacements and
                    so forth. So this is one of the triumphs of American-Turkish cooperation.</p>
                <p>This is not a significant problem any more. However, the illicit traffic in
                    heroin from the Middle East, from Pakistan and farther East, through Turkey and
                    to the Mediterranean, is still a problem on which our Drug Enforcement Agency
                    and the Turkish drug enforcement people work together very closely. However,
                    there no longer is a problem of the illicit cultivation of opium poppies in
                    Turkey.</p>
                <p>Q: Obviously, you reported on political developments in your consular district.
                    Were there any particularly interesting political developments taking place in
                    your consular district?</p>
                <pb facs="0122" n="Page0122"/>
                <p>NEWBERRY: Of course, there were reverberations from national political
                    developments. These were developments which we occasionally felt in rather
                    unexpected ways. Most of eastern Turkey includes what we now call freely the
                    “Kurdish areas.” Political developments were very much under the control of what
                    we called the “A_as,” who were local leaders. They decided whom their people
                    were going to vote for. There was always a lot of competition between the major
                    political parties to get the support of this or that “A_as” and sway his
                    people's vote this way or the other.</p>
                <p>The year that Turkey had a general election when I was consul in Adana, there was
                    a very interesting phenomenon. The “A_as” decided that they didn't like the
                    terms that were being offered by the major political parties. So they supported
                    “independent” candidates. It was the first time that any significant number of
                    independent members of Parliament were elected. This was because the “A_as” were
                    fed up with the two largest political parties in Ankara and put up their own
                    candidates. I don't know that that has ever been repeated in Turkish politics,
                    but it happened that year.</p>
                <p>Of course, we felt the repercussions of that, although there was very little
                    terrorism and kidnaping going on in my consular district. However, there was
                    one, very celebrated case in my district, where terrorists captured, I think,
                    four American sergeants. This led to a big drama, which I watched from afar.</p>
                <p>I had some rather strong differences of opinion with the embassy on the way it
                    was handling the public relations side of this problem. I remember commenting on
                    a particular telegram from the embassy in Ankara. I said that the way the
                    Embassy was “building up” this terrorist, Deniz Gezmi_, it was turning him into
                    something like “Robin Hood.” The embassy's answer was that in these
                    circumstances you have to use television and radio to negotiate with this
                    terrorist. I've never been convinced that that was wise. This terrorist, Deniz
                    Gezmi_, in fact avoided capture and actually “holed up” in my consular district
                    for a time, although we didn't know it then. He was eventually captured and
                    paraded again before the television cameras.</p>
                <p>The Turkish Minister of the Interior had a sort of press conference. It was the
                    beginning of what I considered “depraving” the public media by politicians. This
                    terrorist was a villain. He not only had kidnapped the four Sergeants, but he
                    had terrorized a lot of other people. He was eventually executed. However,
                    because of the way that we conducted negotiations with this terrorist, he was
                    built up, as I said, into a great, “Robin Hood” type of figure. He is still
                    referred to in Turkish politics, and it is said that the Turkish state committed
                    a “terrible crime” in executing this “noble, young man.” That's just one of my
                    pet peeves.</p>
                <pb facs="0123" n="Page0123"/>
                <p>Let me make one more remark on this subject, which shows one aspect of Turkish
                    personality. We returned to Turkey once again before I retired. While all of
                    this drama was going on, and, of course, the whole nation knew about it, Turkish
                    people would stop me on the streets and apologize for what was happening. They
                    would say: “You know, those kidnappers are not 'real' Turks.” This is a standard
                    Turkish comment, that “no real Turk” would do such a thing.</p>
                <p>I remember swallowing hard, taking a breath, and saying: “I have to disagree with
                    you. Just as in America there are 'good Americans' and then some 'bad
                    Americans,' you've got some 'bad Turks.' I think that these people are 'real
                    Turks' who have gone 'bad.'” The instinctive reaction of the Turks was to
                    disassociate themselves and say that “these people can't be real Turks.” We'll
                    come to that subject again, in another interview.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did Israel enter at all in the Palestinian conflict from
                        youperspective? Was there any interest in that in Turkey?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: We had a very particular interest, because we were monitoring what was
                    going on at the Incerlik Air Force Base. We suspected, and then found out that,
                    in spite of the Turkish government's admonition that Incerlik Air Force Base was
                    not to be used in that crisis in Amman, Jordan, when was it, in 1970 or 1971,
                    when the Palestinians...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was the “Black September” incident.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: In spite of all of the admonitions to the contrary, Vice Consul Mike
                    Austrian discovered that the U.S. Air Force, in fact, was using Incerlik Air
                    Force Base for forwarding supplies to Israel. The U.S. Air Force was
                    transporting them down to Israel. One of the most difficult times that I had
                    with the Air Force was when we “blew the whistle” with the embassy and let the
                    embassy know that the Air Force was “breaking the rules.” If the Turks had ever
                    found out about it, this could have spoiled all of our privileges at Incerlik
                    forever more.</p>
                <p>Q: Dan, you were talking about the involvement of the U.S. Air Force in assisting
                    the Israelis with the movement of supplies during the “Black September” crisis
                    of 1970. What was the U.S. Air Force doing and what did you do as far as
                    informing the embassy was concerned? How was this matter handled?</p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: I can't tell you too many of the details. Vice consul Mike Austrian,
                    who was a very observant, alert guy, had a very distinguished career. In fact,
                    he followed my footsteps and was assigned as political counselor at the embassy
                    in Ankara. He had a very important role to play in connection with “Operation
                    Comfort” in Iraq.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0124" n="Page0124"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is he still in the Foreign Service?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: I think that he has just retired. However, his wife, Sheila Austrian,
                    is a senior officer in USIA [United States Information Agency]. We were together
                    in Adana in those days. Mike Austrian discovered this information that the U.S.
                    Air Force was shipping supplies for Israel through the base. I don't think that
                    we ever saw a cargo manifest, but we knew what the destination of this equipment
                    was.</p>
                <p>We had to protect the source of the information. The alternatives were to send a
                    communication through the Air Force or to use our “One Time Pad” cipher system.
                    So I sent Mike Austrian up to the embassy in Ankara to report this in person to
                    the embassy, rather than take all the time to use the “One Time Pad.” The
                    embassy took up the matter from there. The next thing we heard was a “string of
                    oaths” from the colonel at the U.S. Air Force base for our “snitching” on him. I
                    don't know what the cargo was or what the Air Force had told the colonel to say.
                    However, this misuse of Incerlik stopped. That's as much as I know.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This sounds like one of those political arrangements made
                        iWashington, and the Air Force went along with it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: In another respect, this is not too surprising because the U.S. Air
                    Force ran Incerlik as if it were a U.S. installation. They sent planes all over
                    Africa and here, there, and yonder. Some of the U.S. Air Force transports used
                    to go to Israel to buy eggs for the base commissary. So it was a common enough
                    thing for planes to go to Israel. I guess that the Air Force figured that they
                    had a cargo plane available to move these military supplies to Israel. I don't
                    fault anybody on the ground there in the U.S. Air Force detachment at Incerlik.
                    The fault was with whoever in Washington had directed the plane from Incerlik to
                    transport military cargo to Israel. They should have known better. Every time
                    this kind of situation would come up, the Turkish General Staff would remind us
                    that Incerlik was not to be used for this kind of thing. So Washington knew
                    better or should have known better.</p>
                <p>Q: Did you find that the U.S. military commanders there at Incerlik were
                    politically “sensitive,” or was this something that you had to handle
                    yourself?</p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: Some of the U.S. Air Force people were politically sensitive, and some
                    were not. It was a mixed picture. Some of them were excellent and sensitive.
                    Some of them were utterly insensitive. Some of them were downright “hostile” to
                    the State Department.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left Adana in 1971. Where did you go then?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0125" n="Page0125"/>
                <p>NEWBERRY: I left there in 1971. I was assigned to Tangier, Morocco,as consul
                    general.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there from 1971 until...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: I was there for only one year, for reasons which I will explain. First
                    of all, to give you a tip-off as to what's coming up, when I arrived in Tangier
                    to take over as consul general, the Foreign Service inspectors were there. Joe
                    Mendenhall, who was the Senior Inspector, called me in and said: “Dan, you've
                    just arrived here and are not part of this inspection. However, I have to tell
                    you that our first recommendation is to close the post.” So that's a back drop
                    to what I'm going to tell you about Tangier.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I thought that we might cover Tangier and then stop. Or
                        should wwait?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWBERRY: I would rather wait.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Alright. Next time we'll pick it up with your arrival in
                        Tangiein 1971.</hi>
