                <p>FRANCES DIXON</p>
                <p>Interviewed by: Jewell Fenzi</p>
                <p>Initial interview date: March 19, 1986</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is Jewell Fenzi interviewing Frances Dixon on March
                        19, 1986, at my home in Washington, DC. Frances has kindly offered to record
                        the first interview for the Foreign Service Spouse Oral History program. She
                        is a great friend, we've known each other since the mid-1960s in Morocco,
                        and I'm delighted to be talking with you today, Frances. I'd like to ask
                        what posts have you served in other than Morocco?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIXON: Thailand - Bangkok, Pakistan - Karachi, and for a short time in Paris. We
                    served in Morocco twice, first in Rabat, later on we went to Tangier, a total of
                    six years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How nice, my favorite country. Then you were at Carlisle
                        Barracks, and then at the UN</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIXON: After the UN we returned to Washington and Ben was with the Coast Guard.
                    Before that, he was on the Australian desk in the Department.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, you had a varied career. When did you enter the
                        Foreign Service?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIXON: In 1949. From the Marine Corps, Ben had joined General Marshall's staff.
                    From there he entered International Conferences, and from that he was
                    Wristonized [Wristonized - High level civil servants were integrated to further
                    incorporate the post-World War II bureaucracy in Washington, DC into the Foreign
                    Service]. Ben retired in the late 1970s.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was a long career.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIXON: Yes. He served with the Coast Guard for about five years as a POLAD
                    [Political Advisor] officer. He was the first foreign affairs adviser the Coast
                    Guard had. Remember when the Russian was put back on the Russian ship when he
                    was trying to defect. Well, the Coast Guard decided then they needed someone
                    from the State Department, so Ben went to work for them then.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's a long and distinguished career. The first time you
                        went overseas, did you go by ship, or fly? Did you have two little children
                        in tow?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIXON: The children were aged six and seven, and we sailed on the Independence to
                    Algeciras, ferried over to Tangier, and then drove to Rabat.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you had the experience of being in first-class with two
                        little children. (she laughs) Wasn't it lovely!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIXON: Oh yes, it was lovely. Morocco had just achieved independence when we
                    arrived. The first month we were at the Boulima Hotel. Everybody was there — you
                    could walk down the hall and smell food cooking. Eventually we moved to a small
                    apartment, then we found a house out in Agdal [residential neighborhood in
                    Rabat]. Everyone was trying to find houses but the French didn't want to rent
                    and were holding back. We enjoyed Rabat.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you enjoyed Tangier. Was that the only time that Ben
                        was principal officer?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIXON: Yes. He headed the political section in Rabat. They were still rioting and
                    having various troubles when we first got to Rabat. I got caught in a riot one
                    day. I was driving the car with Ruth Williams, whose husband was the
                    administrative officer, returning from the commissary and on every road we
                    encountered tremendous crowds. They would hit the car with sticks — they
                    couldn't tell whether we were French or not. The mob were overturning cars.
                    After locking the passengers in, they set fire to the cars. I kept turning
                    around trying to find another road but always the mobs. Finally a French soldier
                    came by and he told me which route would lead reasonably safely back to our
                    apartment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were any embassy people injured in those riots?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIXON: No, fortunately not, but so many French people were massacred. It was
                    terrible.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I didn't recall that had happened in Morocco, as it had in
                        Algeria — probably ten times worse.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIXON: The transition in Morocco was probably a bit more “peaceful” than in
                    Algeria.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's leap ahead to Tangier. As you know, I've always
                        admired the way you handled your role as the wife of the principal officer
                        there, in what was a very difficult situation. How did you handle that? —
                        because you had the community working with you.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIXON: Well, I knew that the person who was causing all the difficulty had been
                    difficult before, but I didn't tell anyone else that she was like that, and I
                    was on my guard. Regrettably, she was a retired Foreign Service spouse who had
                    caused a great deal of trouble in her Moroccan post, Casablanca. With her over
                    developed imagination, for example, her gossip about one individual resulted in
                    the woman getting a divorce. The consul general in Casablanca had requested that
                    when she and her husband retire, they not come there; so instead they came to
                    Tangier.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was her role after you left? Did your successor
                        handle her as well as you did?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIXON: Well, one of our successors just quit inviting them to parties at the
                    consulate. She had falsely accused the consul of having an affair with one of
                    his officers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So your solution was, really, to work her into the
                        community to the best of your ability — such as not giving her anything of
                        great responsibility to do? What did you do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIXON: Well, I did ask her to help with the British Bazaar by calling people to
                    bake cakes, for instance. Even then she caused me trouble. When our driver
                    Mustapha and I went by to pick up a cake one of the young officer's wives had
                    made, she apologized for not being “able to bring everything down.” After she
                    and Mustapha made several trips up and down carrying boxes, I asked, “Where did
                    all this come from? Why did you make so much?” She replied, “Well, I was told
                    that you wanted all this.” Six cakes, she'd been told. This was news to me, of
                    course. Understandably, the young wife was upset at having been told that the
                    consul general's wife wanted her to make six cakes!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These things may sound very, very trivial as we sit here
                        relating them, but they're not trivial at the time you're living in a
                        microcosm.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIXON: That's right. I had no idea how many other people she had also misled.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In Tangier, I believe you also had a difficult wife of the
                        ambassador. You handled her very well, too.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>DIXON: I think that was because of the distance between us - a nice three and a
                    half hours. I never saw her too much. (both laugh) She was a foreign born spouse
                    — I served with several ambassador's wives of foreign origin — and I think they
                    felt they knew more than U.S. wives.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you think some of that is just insecurity?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIXON: It may be.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I've often wondered, “Could I represent Bulgaria, for
                        instance, if I were married to a ... “ (she laughs) It must be hard for
                        them.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIXON: Mrs. Cannon [Cavendish Wells Cannon was AEP to Yugoslavia (1947); EE/MP to
                    Syria (1950); AEP to Portugal (1952); AET to Greece (1953) and AEP to Morocco
                    (1956)], our ambassador's wife when we were in Rabat, was Austrian. She was
                    very, very difficult but I grew to like her. I knew her also in Tangier, when
                    she was an ex-ambassador's wife. I told her I wanted to pay a call. She said,
                    “Oh no, you are head of this post and I'm coming to call on you.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How interesting to have that role reversal. She showed
                        herself to be a great lady.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIXON: Yes. I'd always liked her although many people didn' t. She was difficult
                    but fair. She was a very nice lady.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What do you think makes a good Foreign Service wife?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIXON: I think you have to really like people and enjoy doing this kind of thing.
                    I've seen husbands retire because the wives just couldn't stand it, didn't enjoy
                    it at all. Fortunately, I enjoyed it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think most of us did. I wonder if most of us still do, I
                        don't know, there's such a change. The formalities, the calling cards, the
                        calls, they had their place, didn't they.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIXON: That's right, they did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How do people today make their contacts at embassies if
                        they don't ...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>DIXON: Don't call, and do that? I just don't know how they meet the people of the
                    country when they don't try to help the ambassador's wife or the chief of
                    mission and try to entertain and do things that may help their husband.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And if they're working in the embassy as switchboard
                        operator, or a commissary manager, what happens to their ability after
                        working an eight-hour day, and when they have children, to go out into the
                        community?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIXON: I don't know how they can do that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I don't think I could do it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIXON: Nor I. When we went overseas, the only thing a wife could do was teach.
                    Ben did have a secretary who had no children, her husband was an FSO and she'd
                    been in the Service, but they let her work because she was American.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's go on to Bangkok.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIXON: In Bangkok we had no trouble, I just loved it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I've never been to Thailand, tell me about your tour
                        there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIXON: I just loved it, it was one of the nicest experiences I've ever had. They
                    say that you either like that part of the world or you detest it, and I really
                    loved Bangkok, I loved the people, just everything about it. The Thais are very
                    sweet, nice people, they have a wall until you get to know them beyond a certain
                    point. But it was delightful. Very little poverty, a happy country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A happy time, in a happy country.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIXON: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you [do] a lot of traveling while you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIXON: We went to Hong Kong quite a bit, I'd like to go back again.</p>

                <p>DIXON: En route to Bangkok we took a cruise ship out of San Francisco that put in
                    at Hawaii, the Philippines, Japan, and finally Hong Kong on the President Line
                    ships, then we flew to Bangkok. When we left Bangkok, we went the other way
                    around, through Europe.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Don't you think that ability to travel by ship was one of
                        the enormous perks of the Foreign Service?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIXON: Yes, the nicest thing. And I really enjoyed every minute of it. Well,
                    there are some things about it — our daughter Mackie got amoebic dysentery at
                    one post. She was more outgoing than our son Ben, she made friends right away.
                    After about six months Ben did too and was having a grand time. Each of our
                    posts had an American school, so they never attended a foreign school. That
                    helped too, I think, for when we returned to the United States they were right
                    where they should have been and there really wasn't an element of
                    difference.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think that's very, very interesting. Let's say they're
                        two young people who certainly benefitted from their Foreign Service
                        experience. I attribute that primarily to your family relationship.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIXON: I think you have to make it fun that you're going to a new place and that
                    it's just going to be wonderful ...</p>

                        have a Presidential or Vice Presidential visit?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIXON: We had Vice President Johnson in Thailand.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tell me about it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIXON: He came to Bangkok, with Lady Bird, Eunice Shriver, and Jean Smith
                    [sisters of then President John F. Kennedy]. He was just amazing. He got on a
                    Thai bus and started hugging and patting all these people. The Thais don't like
                    to be touched at all. After he'd got off the bus, some of the passengers were
                    asked what they thought about it. One of them said that this farong — this big
                    tall man — suddenly appeared on the bus and it was “just as if an elephant began
                    to sing.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: (both laughing) How great! And Lady Bird, I've always
                        admired her.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIXON: She was wonderful there too. The vice president was late everywhere he
                    went, very late to the American Association luncheon at the hotel on the river,
                    a beautiful setting. When he didn't come and didn't come, Lady Bird stood up and
                    talked until he finally arrived. It was glorious the way she was able to talk
                    and entertain people. She was lovely.</p>
                <p>When we were in Karachi, Jackie Kennedy and her sister, Lee Radziwill, came. They
                    rode elephants and went up to the Shalimar Gardens and all over Pakistan. At the
                    end of her visit she drove by the embassy and we all had to be there to wave
                    good bye to her. As she drove by, I could see why all the men thought she was so
                    wonderful, the way she looked at the Marine guards as she drove by. She was
                    absolutely charming, they couldn't have helped but like her. She arrived in
                    Karachi in the midst of a terrible dust storm — your whole house would have a
                    foot of dust in it. We'd all been told to wear long dresses to the reception,
                    but as it turned out she decided to wear a short dress, so we all had to rush
                    around and get into short clothes.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did she dictate that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIXON: She just said that she was wearing a short dress, so the ambassador's wife
                    told us we should too. The Pakistani women were really disappointed that she
                    wasn't more “dressed up.” They, of course, had on beautiful saris, and had
                    looked forward to seeing her because of her reputation as such a well-dressed
                    woman. She didn't wear much jewelry either, but they thought she was just
                    great.</p>
                <p>Bruce Laingen was escort for Lady Bird Johnson — no, I'm thinking about Karachi.
                    David Linebaugh escorted Jackie Kennedy . (on reflection) I know that David
                    Linebaugh did escort Jackie Kennedy because later on after he had that terrible
                    accident — he was back in the U.S. on leave, was very tired, and was driving a
                    Volkswagen down the wrong side of a road because he was used to driving on the
                    left hand side. His car was struck and he was hit in the back of the neck, by
                    the back seat, causing him to be permanently paralyzed — Jackie Kennedy read
                    about it in the paper and got him admitted to NIH. He was so good looking, and
                    he'd had the prospect of a wonderful career ahead of him. But he's never let the
                    accident get him down, he's just remarkable.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How good of Jackie Kennedy to remember that she'd met
                        him.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIXON: I think the Johnsons came to Karachi before we got there, and Bruce was in
                    charge.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your Pakistan tour overlapped with the Laingens.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIXON: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tell us about your relationship with Barbara Hutton in
                        Tangier.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIXON: Well, one day when I answered the telephone a voice said, “This is Barbara
                    Hutton, and I'd like to invite you and your husband for lunch.” I thought it was
                    a practical joker, so I said, “Well, I'll have to check first with my husband,
                    then I'll get in touch with you.” We discovered it really was she who'd invited
                    us. She was married to the Laotian prince Doan na Champassek. He had recently
                    been recognized as a prince, she wanted him to have a French passport to
                    indicate that. He had lived in Morocco and was the son of a French woman and a
                    Laotian father, I believe it was. Barbara Hutton was very nice. Ben asked if she
                    would entertain the U.S. Mediterranean Fleet and she said yes, she'd be
                    delighted to. She had two beautiful parties, one for the officers, one the next
                    night for the enlisted men, both with champagne, smoked salmon, caviar,
                    everything the best that you could have.</p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're telling me very nice things about these public
                        figures. I'm so happy to hear them.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIXON: She had belly dancers come to the parties. One night she and the enlisted
                    men were all sitting around and one of them said, “You know, you sure do look
                    better than I thought you were going to.” (both laugh heartily)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did she take that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIXON: She thought it was very amusing. And then they serenaded her when they
                    left. She just loved everything like that. She was a very sweet, nice person,
                    really, and she wasn't dumb. She was also generous. I think if she hadn't had so
                    much money and had had a nicer childhood, she'd have been really an exceptional
                    woman.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was she shuttled back and forth between ...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIXON: Her father never wanted her, he wanted a boy — she told me all this — but
                    when her mother committed suicide when she was four years old, nobody told her.
                    She went off to school and some of her friends told her. She'd been told merely
                    that her mother was dead but the child hadn't been told how it happened. Barbara
                    Hutton just never had much of a childhood. Her father was very difficult. And
                    then, later, making her debut during the Depression, they had that big costly
                    party for her, which didn't set well with lots of people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When the rest of the country was on breadlines. But that
                        wasn't her fault ...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIXON: And then she had so many husbands — seven, but she always said Cary Grant
                    was the nicest. He was the only one when they were divorced who didn't ask for
                    any money at all. And he was very nice to her son, by her second husband who was
                    killed. She had a lot of tragedy in her life but she was crazy about her
                    father's ex-wife, Marjorie Merriwether Post, they were very close. Mrs. Post's
                    daughter, Deena Merrill, is Barbara Hutton's first cousin (admits she's not
                    exactly sure of this relation). Barbara Hutton was perfectly lovely. She never
                    really looked her age.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: She also gave you a lovely present.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIXON: A beautiful bag. She said it was too heavy for her to carry and she wanted
                    me to have it. It was a beautiful bag and I still have it.</p>

                </p>
                <p>DIXON: When she was about to leave Doan, she wanted to get rid of everything that
                    reminded her of him ...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's continue that charming tale about the mirror.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIXON: The hand is about the size of a person's hand, and I wondered why it never
                    needed polishing. I thought it was brass, until a friend of mine, Anne Sednaoui
                    came up from Rabat to Tangier. She smelled the mirror and said, “Well, the
                    reason why you don't have to polish it, Frances, is because it's gold.” So then
                    I took it to a jeweler, who said that it was gold.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How could Anne Sednaoui smell gold? Have you tried
                        smelling gold since then? (laughing)</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIXON: Well, I guess it didn't smell like brass, maybe that was it. (both laugh)
                    So I said, “Well, I'll just leave it on the table in the living room.” Because
                    nobody would think it was gold.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course not. I remember seeing that, it's lovely. Do you
                        know what the little poem says — it's in Arabic, I suppose.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIXON: It's something about when she looks in the mirror, the beautiful blue eyes
                    — something overly romantic and apparently in very bad Arabic. Then Barbara
                    Hutton also gave us a painting. Doan was an artist, which is how they met — on a
                    trip with some friends, I think it was to Fez, she thought he was very
                    attractive. Later on he came to Tangier and brought her this painting of what he
                    had imagined her parties were like. She used to have parties on the rooftops of
                    her big house, very festive, with dancing girls and delicious food. So he
                    painted this painting that we have in our library. She also gave Ben a huge
                    brass Moroccan hand that had belonged to El Glaoui [El Glaoui - powerful tribal
                    figure who sided with the French against Mohammed V, the first sultan after
                    Moroccan independence in 1956], which had hung over Doan's bed. She wanted to
                    get rid of all those mementos of Doan and just gave it to Ben.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I remember that too, a huge thing, very beautiful. You had

                    families, their home in England is Wilton, and some of the furniture in the

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's another reason I've wondered and have often felt
                        sorry for the women who can't handle that — the dragon ladies of yesteryear
                        whom you've encountered and there again handled very well. You were going to
                        tell me, however, of your initial encounter as a young officer's wife with,
                        well, let's just mention Mrs. Henderson.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>DIXON: Mary Anne Stoessel had a tea in Georgetown for a group of new Foreign
                    Service wives. We were told that when Mrs. Henderson came in we should all stand
                    up. At that time her husband was deputy under secretary for Management. We knew
                    that she was elderly, so when an elderly lady came in we all stood up, and she
                    was lovely to us. A little bit later another elderly woman came in, and this
                    time only a couple of other women and I stood up. The second lady was Mrs.
                    Henderson; the first woman had been Mrs. Hickerson. Well, Mrs. Henderson sat
                    down and started right off telling us how rude it was when people didn't stand
                    up for an ambassador's wife, even though her husband was not an ambassador at
                    the time. She told us that we should stand aside and let the ambassador's wife
                    go in the door first, and never sit on the right-hand side of the sofa, and so
                    forth.</p>
                <p>Finally we were asked to come in to tea. The hostess asked Mrs. Henderson if she
                    would pour — tea, I think it was — and she also asked Mrs. Hickerson, whose
                    husband was an ambassador at the time, to pour. I've forgotten which is a bigger
                    honor, to be asked to pour tea or to pour coffee. [Coffee is considered the
                    greater honor.] As it happened, Mrs. Hickerson was asked to pour the more
                    important beverage. Mrs. Henderson was absolutely beside herself. She spoke
                    terribly to poor Mary Anne Stoessel, who had made this big faux pas in giving
                    Mrs. Hickerson the bigger honor. Mary Anne went on to become wife of the
                    ambassador to the USSR and also under secretary of State [Walter J. Stoessel Jr.
                    had a long and distinguished Foreign Service career which culminated in his
                    being Secretary of State ad interim in 1982.]. The party was in 1949, and at
                    that time, of course, she was just a young wife who had been in the Service only
                    somewhat longer than the young wives she'd invited to tea, at her house.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh! Mrs. Henderson had merely been invited to come? She
                        wasn't there to instruct you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIXON: No. This was a party in a private home.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And Mrs. Henderson took it upon herself to ...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIXON: To correct everybody! (both laugh) But Mrs. Hickerson behaved very well,
                    she didn't make any to-do about being called down because she was pouring the
                    wrong thing. We must check on which is the bigger honor — to pour tea or to pour
                    coffee. I think it is coffee.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It seems to me that you got out into the community in
                        Pakistan and Thailand and Morocco. Actually, you probably had a better time,
                        and learned more about the country, than Ben did. He and Guido were always
                        in the office with Economic affairs or Political affairs.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>DIXON: That's right. One of the nicest things in Bangkok was that we worked with
                    Jim Thompson, the man, you'll recall, who “discovered” Thai silk and put it on
                    the market. He had a perfectly beautiful Thai house, he'd put three houses
                    together. It really was a spectacular place — the furniture was all covered in
                    Thai silk. He wanted to help the blind school, so he opened it several times
                    each week to the public and tourists could see it. The house was on a klong and
                    perfectly lovely. Embassy wives had the pleasure of showing people around who
                    came to visit and to learn about Thai silk, which was woven across the klong
                    from Thompson's house. A klong is a small river, and many klongs circulated
                    among the houses in Bangkok. You could take a boat and ride by his house. An
                    architect by profession, he went to Bangkok originally with the OSS. On
                    returning to New York he showed some Thai silk to Diana Vreeland, editor of
                    Vogue, and she said, “It's the most beautiful thing I've seen, how can you get
                    more?” He went back to Thailand, which saw to it that the dyes were perfected.
                    Thai silk is all around the world now, including at Buckingham Palace.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You learned a bit about it through being a volunteer
                        spouse? (reading from list of topics spouses might discuss) — your most
                        outstanding experience... most frightening... most amusing ...”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIXON: I think my “most frightening” was the episode in Rabat.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: “... coping with isolation and removal from U.S.
                        mainstream...” Did you ever feel isolated in Pakistan?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIXON: No, I never felt isolated.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You always had one child with you at least, didn't
                        you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIXON: Yes. They both were with us until Tangier and then Ben went to boarding
                    school. You know, having children with you helps. You meet more people through
                    them. In Rabat we lived alongside French and Moroccans and our children had
                    friends among all sorts of children. It was really a wonderful experience. I've
                    often thought that it would be harder for people without children.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think it is. (wondering if they've covered everything
                        and saying it's time to break for lunch)</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>DIXON: Oh, once in Karachi — we were good friends of Pakistanis, Jimmy Fancy
                    [phon. spelling] the very richest people there. I'm reminded of this because the
                    Aga Khan was at the White House last night to dinner. The son, Karim, ahhh! I
                    was always in love with him. (Fenzi laughs) Once when he came to his mother's
                    house, next door to us, to meet Pakistani ladies, she said that she wanted me to
                    come. Another Foreign Service wife, Ute Macuk and myself were the only
                    foreigners there. It was so exciting, and he was charming.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was invited to meet the women separately from the
                        men?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIXON: Yes. No other men were there. The women were all just thrilled. I was
                    surprised they didn't stand up when he came in, the other wife and I stood up
                    and spoke to him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: (laughing) You were conditioned diplomatic wives. My
                        daughter's recollection of the younger Aga Khan dates from about 1965 when
                        she was 12, in boarding school in Switzerland. His chalet was next to theirs
                        and the only thing she ever saw of him was his feet, because he'd sit and
                        read and she could see his feet through the window.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIXON: He got bald, recently. He married an English woman but I don't know if
                    they're still married.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about “...representational entertaining...” Before I
                        went to Freetown, I remember being told at the course at FSI that I must
                        take my fish forks.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIXON: I remember when we were new to the Foreign Service and Ben saw Johanna
                    Moore at a party — I could have killed him! He said, “Frances has just been down
                    to visit her mother and has come back with finger bowls, so now she's able to
                    enter the Foreign Service.” (both laugh heartily) But that's right, you did
                    entertain that way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I didn't have any fish forks but I had some gold Italian
                        fruit forks and knives and I used those as fish forks.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIXON: I didn't have any either, and Mrs. Cannon when I was in Tangier said,
                    [speaking in hushed tones] “You don't have any fish forks?” So when she left she
                    gave me a whole dozen fish forks and knives and a fish service. (they break up
                    in laughter again) She just couldn't believe I'd been in the Foreign Service all
                    that time without fish forks. Things have definitely changed. I heard some time
                    ago that a consul general was told that she either had to marry the man she had
                    living with her in the residence or leave the post.</p>

                </p>
                <p>DIXON: I just wonder.</p>
