                <p>AMBASSADOR CHARLES T. CROSS</p>
                <p>Interviewed by: Charles Stuart Kennedy</p>
                <p>Initial interview date: November 19, 1997</p>
                <p>Copyright 2001 ADST</p>
                <p>Q: Let us start at the beginning. Where and when were you born?</p>
                <p>CROSS: I was born in Peking, now called Beijing by foreigners also, which is the
                    name that the Chinese used all along. I was born in 1922. I stayed in China -
                    except for a couple of years spent in the U.S. - until I was 18. I spent those
                    two years in Auburndale (Massachusetts) and Oberlin, (Ohio) - a year in each
                    place. Much of the material in this oral history can also be found in my book,
                    Born a Foreigner: a Memoir of the American Presence in Asia - Rowman and
                    Littlefield 1999/2000.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tell us a little about your parents and life in Beijing in
                        youteens.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROSS: My parents were missionaries, essentially in the education field. My
                    mother went to China first in 1915; she was a music teacher and a professional
                    kindergarten teacher in Beijing. She organized some of the first kindergarten
                    teacher training schools in China. She also established a number of
                    kindergartens in the city.</p>
                <p>My father came to China in 1917. His first job, after a couple of years of
                    language training, was at Peking National University (Beida) - then and now
                    China's foremost university. It was an interesting time for him to be there
                    because it was a time of seething intellectual activity in China. Mao Zedong was
                    at the University; Chen Duxiu, one of the founders of the Chinese Communist
                    Party, led some of the discussions that had been organized by my father. So he
                    was very much part of the surging intellectual activity which was part of the
                    May 4th Movement. That movement was one of the great forces in Chinese
                    intellectual history. A lot of things happened at about the same time. For
                    example, the Chinese characters, which were used in ordinary talk, were
                    substituted for traditional, classical-style characters. That made it possible
                    for many, many more Chinese to be literate. The communists and the nationalists,
                    as well as non-political forces, took advantage of this change since they could
                    then reach much wider audiences.</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>My father later became the General Secretary of the American Board Mission in
                    North China. That board was part of the Congregational ministry. Both of my
                    parents were Congregationalists. In 1931, we returned to the States for a couple
                    of years, as I mentioned. We returned to China in 1933; we took up residence in
                    what is now a suburb of Beijing - about 14 miles outside the city walls. In that
                    suburb was an American boarding school which I attended.</p>
                <p>I attended that boarding school for seven years. During that time, the most
                    important event in my life was the Japanese invasion of North China in 1937,
                    starting on July 7. There was a considerable amount of fighting in our
                    neighborhood; there were sizeable massacres first perpetrated by the Chinese and
                    then by the Japanese. So my last three years in high school were under Japanese
                    rule although we had extra-territorial privileges and therefore did not suffer
                    the hardships that were rained on the Chinese.</p>
                <p>Q: I have been reading an interview of John Stewart Service, who was also an
                    off-spring of missionary parents. He said that his parents kept him away from
                    Chinese kids which resulted in his Chinese not being very good. What was your
                    experience?</p>
                <p>CROSS: I don't think my parents kept me away from Chinese playmates. When I lived
                    in Beijing, I had as many Chinese playmates as American. It is true that our
                    Chinese language skills were not advanced sufficiently. We learned Chinese in
                    school, but we didn't go very far because it was just another academic subject.
                    We also had to learn French and Latin, for example. So I never progressed very
                    far in the written aspects of the language. My accent in conversations has a
                    Beijing flavor and that is an asset.</p>
                <p>Q: Did you, in high school, manage to feel the ferment that was going on - the
                    Kuomintang, which was then relatively new and rather progressive. Then of course
                    came the Japanese.</p>
                <p>CROSS: The Kuomintang had just barely finished the formal unification of China in
                    1937. In 1931, the Japanese took all of Manchuria. From there, they began to
                    infiltrate south of the Great Wall into the Beijing area. Starting in 1933 and
                    for the next couple of years, they marched inexorably south. The Kuomintang was
                    the national resistance. In December 1936, Chiang Kai-shek was kidnaped by
                    General Jang Xueliang, who had been a young marshal in Manchuria where he had
                    been defeated by the Japanese. He stayed in North-West China where he kidnaped
                    Chiang Kai-shek. The latter had come to attack the communists, who at the end of
                    the Long March had reached Yanan. Chiang's release was contingent on his
                    declaration of nationalist solidarity.</p>
                <p>I remember that on Christmas night - or Eve - Chiang was released. Immediately,
                    in the area where our home was, the Chinese students from near by schools
                    paraded past our house and the Japanese sentries were stationed on the city
                    walls. They shouted slogans such as “defeat the Japanese” or “long live the
                    Kuomintang,” sung to the tune of Fr�re Jacques.</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>My father noted at the time that this demonstration and those throughout China
                    would remind the Japanese that China was united, which should have been a
                    warning to them. The Japanese read it as a threat and decided to complete the
                    conquest of China, which they started in July 1937.</p>
                <p>As high school students, we visited the battlefields and had some contacts with
                    Chinese students. A classmate of mine and I took some money, wrapped in some old
                    clothes, and traveled from Beijing all the way out to Fenzhou in Shanxi province
                    - that is the area from which Art Hummel, later an ambassador to China, came.
                    Carrying that money was illegal under Japanese rule. The train tracks had been
                    blown at a couple of spots, which made the trip quite exciting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did your schoolmates support the Chinese rather than the
                        Japanese?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROSS: Oh, yes. We were fanatically anti-Japanese. I was a stronanti-Japan
                    proponent. That is not surprising; they were brutal.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the Japanese occupy Beijing while you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROSS: They did indeed in 1937. I graduated from high school in 1940, so that I
                    spent three years watching the Japanese from a close vantage point. The
                    foreigners were not mistreated, but our lives were certainly restricted.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you have any impressions of how the Japanese were
                        acting?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROSS: I think they were somewhat less belligerent in Beijing than there were in
                    the rest of China. I remember one time, in the winter, seeing a burning village.
                    During the train trip I mentioned earlier, we noticed the communist forces being
                    very active. In fact, the Kuomintang forces were defeated by the Japanese and
                    had to retreat. That left a vacuum which was rapidly filled by the
                    communists.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did your fellow students have any views about the
                        communisresistance?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>CROSS: The communist resistance was all there was opposing the Japanese. So a lot
                    of the foreigners had contacts with them. They were all very tightly organized.
                    Inside Beijing, they had many agents. But if you went to some of the rural areas
                    which had mission stations - some that were less than fifty miles from Beijing -
                    you could meet the communists quite openly. In fact, Chinese students were
                    heading towards “Free China” - the nationalist area where Chongqing is located.
                    They would head that way by foot transiting areas run by the communists, who
                    would help them reach “Free China.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did any of your Chinese friends make this journey?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROSS: Several of them did. They went to Chongqing. I don't remember any of them
                    joining the communists, but obviously many Chinese did, including some from
                    Yanjing University about whom I learned later.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did your parents do their work under Japanese
                        occupation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROSS: They had certain restrictions on their work. Americans had the right to
                    run certain schools; they were not interfered with by the Japanese themselves,
                    but some of their puppets tried to place some limits on activities. But the
                    schools and the missionaries were handled quite delicately, until Pearl Harbor.
                    My father's travels in China were somewhat curtailed. [Note: See Born a
                    Foreigner for more on the Japanese in China]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left China in 1940 when you were 18. How would you
                        grade yousecondary school education?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROSS: I think I got a good American education, if passing the college entrance
                    examination and being accepted by a good American college is a standard for
                    judgement. Our teachers were from Yale, Haverford, and Smith. They were not
                    professional teachers since most had just graduated from college. Some were
                    better than others, but I think we all received a pretty good education. Our
                    parents had advanced degrees themselves, which was the goal that they demanded
                    for their children.</p>
                <p>I went to Carleton College - the second Cross generation to do so. The
                    Congregationalist had started Harvard, Yale, Amherst and Williams. Then they
                    moved west and founded Oberlin and then Carleton, Grinnel, and Pomona further
                    west.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in Carleton during what years?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>CROSS: I was there from 1940 until I joined the Marines in May, 1942 after
                    finishing my sophomore year. I remained in the service for four years and then
                    returned to Carleton and received my degree in 1947. Then I went to Yale for
                    graduate studies and got an MA in 1949.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let me ask about the first time you were at Carleton. Had
                        yodecided what to major in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROSS: I had been interested in the Foreign Service since high school. I don't
                    know exactly why it caught my fancy; I had considered a medical career as a
                    doctor. There was no place better to be exposed to that career than in a mission
                    hospital. The doctor there would let me observe operations and other processes
                    during school holidays. But I got a “C” in chemistry, which suggested that I
                    seek another line of work.</p>
                <p>In any case, my interest in other areas increased. My father had a number of
                    acquaintances in the Foreign Service; he liked them. One was Edmund Clubb, the
                    consul general in Beijing. He knew Colonel Stilwell-later a well known general.
                    I think my father liked these people because they were interested in learning
                    Chinese and saw that they worked well with the Chinese. So I was exposed to the
                    Foreign Service through my father's contacts. I also met some Foreign Service
                    kids. All of that raised my interest in the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>When I entered Carleton, I decided that I would major in international relations,
                    history and English. In fact, practically all of my courses were in those three
                    subjects except for the required courses in science, philosophy, and
                    economics.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When Pearl Harbor was bombed by the Japanese in 1941, what
                        diyou do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROSS: I was working in the tea room of the College - that was my employment. I
                    was surprised by how many of the customers whom I was serving did not know where
                    Pearl Harbor was. I was excited by the war because I hated the Japanese so much.
                    So I began to think about volunteering for military service, but I was
                    considered too short and not yet academically ready for some of the Navy
                    programs. I had earlier decided that the Marines were the branch of service
                    which I wanted to join. But just as I was about to enlist, I found out about a
                    Navy recruitment effort for people who could learn Japanese or who already knew
                    it. By using some family influence, I was allowed to enlist to go to the
                    language school in Boulder, Colorado. Upon graduation from that school, one was
                    eligible for a commission in the Marine Corps - a fact that I discovered after I
                    started in school. So that is how I got into the military.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the language training
                        program?</hi>
                </p>

                <p>CROSS: It was a high pressure cooker. One of my colleagues was a young man from
                    Carleton, Roger Hackette, who had been born in Japan. He and I were the youngest
                    members of the class. Everyone else had graduated from college and some were
                    attending post-graduate schools. They were all people who had made their marks
                    academically. We were assigned to small classes, according to our progress.
                    There was movement from one class to another depending on one's ability. We had
                    a horrendous exam every Saturday morning; the results were publicly announced.
                    The pressure to stay in the course was tremendous since the alternative was to
                    be sent to the fleet as a low level enlisted man. We had constant language
                    drills; we used Naganuma readers which had been used to teach our military
                    attaches assigned to Japan before the war. These were good text books.We had to
                    memorize long Japanese paragraphs to get the feel for conversational Japanese.
                    We didn't get much instruction on military Japanese, which was to be our
                    fundamental tool. I caught up to that aspect of the language after my officer's
                    training on the West Coast. I was sent to an Army camp outside of Minneapolis -
                    Camp Savage. It was staffed primarily by Nisei and our task was to examine
                    Japanese military documents which we were most likely to encounter in a combat
                    situation.</p>
                <p>When I joined a Marine combat group, my Japanese was used mostly in trying to
                    talk people out of caves and other hide-outs. I did do quick scans of some
                    captured documents.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: To what unit were you assigned and where were you
                        stationed?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROSS: I was in the 23rd Marines, an infantry regiment which was part of the 4th
                    Marine Division. We went from San Diego to the Marshall Islands - the longest
                    amphibious operation in history. When that was over, we went to Maui. From
                    there, we went to Saipan followed by Tinian; then it was back to Maui to prepare
                    for Iwo Jima, where we fought in February, 1945.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you go in the Marshalls?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROSS: We went to the Kwajalein Atoll. My regiment landed on a small island
                    called Roi where the airfield was located. We didn't encounter very much
                    resistance. My role as an interpreter was first of all to participate in the
                    interrogation of prisoners and the translation of captured Japanese documents.
                    We could quickly scan those papers and select those which appeared to be of
                    special interest. That operation only lasted for a brief period; Saipan and
                    Tinian took about ten weeks all together.</p>
                <p>Q: Was it on Saipan where there were a lot of civilians?</p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>CROSS: Yes. Some of the civilians surrendered without putting up any kind of
                    fight. Those were the ones that were further removed from Japanese troops.
                    Others panicked and in the latter stages of our operation jumped into the sea
                    off some cliffs. We tried to talk the soldiers out of the caves, as I mentioned
                    earlier. If they didn't respond, I would order my squad - engineers, rifleman, a
                    corpsman, a radio operator - to blow the cave shut. There were a few soldiers
                    who surrendered.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get much from a captured Japanese soldier?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROSS: Most of our captives were lower rank soldiers who really didn't have any
                    information. The Japanese had been drilled not to surrender; that meant that
                    those who were captured really felt in their minds that they were no longer
                    Japanese and therefore, more or less, felt they had switched sides. We treated
                    them well in a friendly way and that had a positive impact. They were astonished
                    by their treatment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would imagine that in the heat of battle it would hard
                        tcontrol the troops.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROSS: That is right. I had no problem with my own Marines, but we did have some
                    stupid commanders in front who let their emotions rule good judgement. I must
                    say that that didn't happen at Iwo Jima. By that time, these commanders had been
                    better trained and we were veterans - those of us who survived.</p>
                <p>Iwo Jima was a very tough battle. We took very heavy casualties. The Japanese
                    defended the island with considerable skill. Previously, as for example at
                    Saipan, they would make banzai charges, which resulted in devastating losses to
                    their troops. In Iwo, they didn't give up any positions; they had to be uprooted
                    position by position. The soldiers we did capture had been left behind, mostly
                    living in caves - the remnants of squads who had not died nor been wounded. We
                    treated the prisoners very gently.</p>
                <p>I remember one whose nose had been blown off and whose spinal chord had been
                    damaged so that he couldn't move. He was sent to Pearl Harbor, placed in a Navy
                    hospital and cured. He was given a new nose which was then - and still would be
                    - bigger than the average Japanese nose. He now points to his face and says that
                    he is part American. The medics repaired his spinal chord so that he first got
                    around in a wheel chair, then graduated to crutches, to walking on his own at an
                    increasing pace. During his convalescence, the command gave him a job
                    maintaining the hospital grounds. When he was ready to return to Japan in 1948,
                    he was given back pay for the three years he spent working in the hospital. He
                    used that nest egg to start a little business.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They were Japanese showing up months after our
                        invasion.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROSS: That is true. I returned to Iwo Jima in 1995 - 50 years after seeing
                    action there. I was a guest of the Sumo Association. My friend, John Rich of
                    NBC, who had gotten me invited was also a veteran of the battle; in fact we were
                    the only two American participants who had been there 50 years earlier. There
                    may have been as many as ten Japanese who had fought on Iwo Jima also and had
                    been captured. Every one else in the huge crowd were relatives of Japanese
                    people who had been killed in the battle or newsmen.</p>
                <p>We attended a lot of ceremonies. We went to the top of Suribachi, which is the
                    hump at one end of the island. From there we spotted a rock in the middle of the
                    beach. Two of our divisions had lined on that rock; my division was on the right
                    of it and the 5th Division was on the left. I landed very near that rock. I am
                    sure that the Japanese, dug in on the hump, could have seen my face. We finally
                    captured it and then raised the famous flag there. The Japanese were directing
                    their fire on us from the other end of the island; there were no heavy guns on
                    Suribachi. They just had enough weapons to protect the observation post. For the
                    first few days, we had to suffer very heavy artillery fire.</p>
                <p>The Japanese whom I described earlier - the one who had reconstructive surgery
                    and payment for work done - was at this meeting. He described his experiences
                    with Americans; some of the audience commented that “the Japanese would never
                    have done that.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where were you when the war ended?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROSS: I was in Pearl Harbor attending a course. We celebrated like mad, of
                    course. I must say that I had some different reactions to the use of atomic
                    bombs. I wondered if it could have been used earlier in places were we fought
                    and lost so many men. I have never been apologetic about the bombs. Beyond the
                    fact that we would have continued to just slaughter thousands of Japanese from
                    the air and to starve the main island, the use of the bombs ended the war and
                    forced the Japanese to abandon their empire, such as in China. They had
                    mistreated the Chinese and others in Southeast Asia and were a great concern to
                    many other countries. The bombs provided the opportunity for the emperor to
                    surrender - even if it was opposed by some of the Japanese army hotheads. It
                    also provided the opportunity for a benevolent American occupation of Japan; we
                    didn't have to share control of Japan with the Soviets.</p>
                <p>After the end of the war, I was detached from the 4th Division and sent to the
                    1st Division which had been ordered to move into China. I had the pleasure of
                    liberating my home town.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find China when you returned? How did you get
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>CROSS: I first flew to Shanghai; then I went to Tianjin, where I caught a troop
                    train to Beijing. I was part of the first American Marine contingent that
                    entered Beijing. I was caught in a moment of supreme pride and joy because it
                    was the American Marines who were taking the Japanese out of China.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While you were in China, did you observe any of the
                        frictions between the nationalist and the communists?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROSS: Sure. When we arrived, we were met by some Chinese officials waiting on
                    the train platform. The first thing they said to our colonel was to thank him
                    for his speech, which included some words about peace and the UN. But they went
                    on to say that they had a big problem. The Japanese had retreated to their
                    barracks leaving the guarding of the city wall to the “puppet troops.” The 8th
                    Route (communist) Army was in the west in the hills, right outside the city. The
                    officials wanted a show of American force. So we patrolled the city in trucks
                    and jeeps, displaying our presence to the thousands of Chinese citizens.</p>
                <p>We did bring nationalist troops into Manchuria. Some came into our area, but at a
                    much slower pace because our priority was the Sino-Soviet border which we did
                    not wish the Soviets to breach. In fact, some Soviets had entered Manchuria and
                    had looted it bare. The Chinese communist troops were also moving towards
                    Manchuria. One day we Marines were on patrol duty between Tianjin and Beijing
                    and came across a fellow in a mustard uniform from the communist army. He
                    stopped us; we asked him why. He asked us to wait while his troops crossed the
                    road. We asked what troops. He told us what division or brigade of the 8th Route
                    Army he belonged to. I asked him to let me talk to his commanding officer. The
                    Chinese whistled and his officer came up to us riding his bicycle. He had a
                    small pistol in his pocket. He told us that his troops had been marching 90 li
                    each day - about 30 miles - for the last three days. We asked where he was
                    going; he said that Manchuria was his goal, which he was going to help to
                    liberate. I pointed out that there were already Chinese troops there; he said he
                    was really going to liberate it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we taking sides in this intra-Chinese struggle?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROSS: We were; we were supporting the Nationalists. We transported them, for
                    example, from West China to Taiwan. We were transporting them as rapidly as we
                    could while at the same time removing the Japanese from China. We would load the
                    Nationalists on a ship, take them to a Chinese port, disembark them and then
                    embark the Japanese for a trip to Japan. Then the ship would go to some port,
                    like Shanghai or Hong Kong, and start the circle once again. We poured the
                    Nationalist troops into North China.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the Marines have a sense of mission?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROSS: No, we didn't. This is an important point. We were assigned a political
                    task, but knew few of the details because it was a very delicate game that the
                    U.S. was playing. We were trying to help the Nationalists to get into position,
                    but our orders really were to evacuate the Japanese. If we really wanted to help
                    the Nationalists, we should have kept the Japanese in China. But of course that
                    would not have been acceptable. We were never fully briefed on the American
                    game.</p>
                <p>Q: In retrospect, do you think that you didn't have full guidance because the
                    Washington policy makers weren't sure themselves on our objectives?</p>
                <p>CROSS: I think, in looking back, that we were really seeking peace between the
                    Nationalists and the Communists. We were not going to let the Communists win by
                    default. Only a few months after we landed in China, the Marshall mission came.
                    I had already left China by that time. That mission was mounted in the hope of
                    finding a peaceful solution to the Communist-Nationalist struggle. It did not
                    succeed because neither side was willing to share power.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CROSS: I had enough points to enable me to be discharged. I went home to my
                    parents' apartment in New York. I arrived there on December 23, 1945. I got
                    married six days after being discharged. I had met my wife at Carleton; she
                    comes from that part of the country.</p>
                <p>I then went back to college for another two years. Then I went tYale graduate
                    school.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CROSS: I was four years maturer and was married. I had been an officer. My
                    service in the Marine Corps had not changed my mind to enter the Foreign
                    Service. But I didn't want to take the exam right away. The GI bill paid for my
                    last years in college as well as my graduate studies.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CROSS: I concentrated on Far East studies and international relations. I had a
                    chance to go on for a Ph.D., but by this time I was tired of academics. I
                    attended Yale from 1947 to 1949.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CROSS: It did, but the “experts” had not really returned to Yale by that time.
                    Yale had some graduate students teaching in China; some were Ph.D. candidates.
                    Some returned, but were not quite at a professorial level.</p>
                <p>The language studies were very good. I took more Chinese language courses.
                    Japanese history courses were good. One of the Chinese history courses was
                    taught by a Harvard professor.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CROSS: Yes indeed. My father, who, as I mentioned, lived and worked in New York,
                    was the head of the Far East Committee of the Foreign Mission Conference - a
                    sort of eclectic organization. So he was greatly concerned about what was going
                    to be done with China. He of course had very strong feelings about all that was
                    going on in China at the time. On the whole, I think he leaned toward the
                    Communists.</p>
                <p>Q: What was the general attitude towards the KMT and the communists? That is the
                    alleged general corruption in Chiang Kai-shek's KMT and the communist
                    willingness to carry the burden of the fighting?</p>
                <p>CROSS: There was considerable discussion of the corruption; there was a general
                    feeling that the Nationalists would not win the civil war and that therefore we
                    should make some kind of a deal with the Communists. The Marshall mission, which
                    I mentioned before, was still active during this time.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CROSS: It was really split. My faculty advisor, David Rowe, was very
                    pro-nationalist. Some of the other faculty members were less so. It was
                    interesting that many of the Army officers who were at Yale to study Chinese had
                    served in the European theater. They were largely anti-communist in light of
                    their experiences - and this was still only 1947.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While you were studying at Yale, did you make any
                        inquiries abouthe Foreign Service?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROSS: Indeed I did. I took the Foreign Service exam in September, 1948. It was
                    then still a two and a half day exam - terrible. I passed the written part, but
                    I failed in the French exam. I thought I knew enough of that language so that I
                    didn't do any extra work preparing for the exam. Roughly in this same time
                    period, I was offered a very attractive scholarship to pursue a Ph.D., but I was
                    tired of academia at the time.</p>
                <p>So I went to Washington with a list of Yale alumni in various bureaucracies. I
                    visited CIA and military intelligence. I went to the State Department's Bureau
                    of Intelligence and Research (INR) - or its predecessor. All of these
                    organizations offered me a job, but the best one, in terms of interest, was the
                    one I got from the United States Information Service (later USIA) - then still a
                    part of the Department of State. I accepted their offer. I finally took the
                    Foreign Service exam again and passed it while I was in Hong Kong - my fourth
                    post.</p>
                <p>Taipei - 1949-1950</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did you join USIS? What were your first
                        assignments?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROSS: June, 1949. I started in Taipei. We had been assigned to Chungking, but
                    just before we boarded the ship on our way to Hong Kong, we were told that the
                    assignment had been changed to Taipei because the State Department had withdrawn
                    all our personnel from Chungking.</p>
                <p>We were in Taipei from August, 1949 to January, 1950. My wife had gotten a job at
                    the university. The tour was cut short for a very interesting reason. Matters
                    were progressing quite well in Taipei. The U.S. had bombed the city quite
                    heavily during the war, but the Taiwanese and the nationalists were moving along
                    quite smartly in reconstruction. But the Department became rattled; it thought
                    that the island would fall into communist hands. It sent a fellow by the name of
                    Krentz, who had been in Taipei as consul general at one time. His task was to
                    get us all to leave. The staff had met together and had assessed the situation
                    in Taipei. We sent a message to the Department saying that in our view, the
                    Chinese on Taiwan had decided to stick with the Nationalists. We called them
                    “the distillation of defeat” in that they could have joined the Communists on
                    the Mainland but did not. That suggested that they would oppose any communist
                    takeover and that in our view, there was not a danger of Taipei falling into the
                    wrong hands.</p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>The Department, of course, did not accept our view. I said that I would remain in
                    Taipei, but I would send my family to Hong Kong. That was not acceptable because
                    the Department saw Hong Kong as also falling to the Communists. I then suggested
                    Japan, but that was also turned down because it was under the Occupation. It
                    suggested that my family be repatriated to the U.S.; that was not acceptable to
                    us because we had no place to live there.</p>
                <p>Finally, all of us who had families were transferred to other posts - all of
                    which were by any standard far more dangerous than Taipei. We went to Jakarta in
                    the middle of the transfer of power from the Dutch to the Indonesians. One
                    family went to Saigon; one went to Rangoon where the Red Flag Communists and the
                    White Flag Communists were engaged in a war. One family went to Seoul - just
                    before the end of the Korean war. Ed Martin went to Burma. Dave Osborn went to
                    Japan, I believe. Some of the CIA officers were sent to other posts. Some people
                    sent their families to the U.S. and then sat in Taipei for many months - in
                    perfect safety and comfort.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is a very interesting story. You said that it was
                        thDepartment that misread the situation.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROSS: Indeed. The decision was made at the highest levels of thDepartment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you first arrived in Taipei, what was your
                        assignment?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROSS: My first job was to open some branch libraries throughout the island. I
                    went first to Taichung and Kaohsiung to talk to owners of some stores. We opened
                    USIS libraries in both places with locally-hired librarians. We gave them books
                    and they were in business. On one occasion, I was sent around Taiwan - I was one
                    of the first people in the consulate to travel all around the island. Now it can
                    be done easily, but in 1950 the roads on the east side of the island were cut
                    right into the cliffs. They were very narrow and some parts were still unpaved.
                    Traffic had to be directed so that passage was open only in one direction -
                    changing that direction every two hours or so.</p>
                <p>Everywhere I went I was treated royally, as if I were the ambassador himself. The
                    Chinese refused to accept the idea that even one as low in rank as I would not
                    have some goodies to bring them. But our policy was that we were not going to do
                    anything to support the Nationalists - at that time, anyway.</p>
                <p>I took notes. I remember one case in which a Chinese army communications officer
                    asked for some equipment. I told him that I thought we would not honor his
                    request. He replied that when we sent communications equipment to Taiwan, we
                    should make sure it got to him. By the time I finished this five day trip around
                    the island, I found that we were again sending a lot of equipment to the
                    Nationalists - some of which was communications material.</p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>Q: Was there in late 1949, an obvious distaste for the Nationalists? Did people
                    think they were losers who didn't have a chance? Was our policy under
                    review?</p>
                <p>CROSS: I think there was a desire to write them off, so that we could start all
                    over again. There was a feeling that they would lose Taiwan because they had
                    given up on the mainland. You have to remember that many of the losses on the
                    mainland had much to do with defections. I think that experience weighed heavily
                    on our policy makers. They didn't believe our “distillation of defeat” theory.
                    The hard-core Chinese - Chiang Kai-shek, some intellectuals, some doctors, the
                    western trained - didn't see it as we did. These people were less
                    pro-Nationalist than they were anti-Communists. They were scared.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any signs at the time of frictions between the
                        mainlanNationalists and the native Taiwanese?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROSS: When I arrived, we talked to the Taiwanese in Japanese and to the
                    mainlanders in Mandarin. I still had enough Japanese to carry on a conversation.
                    The Taiwanese had been treated very badly by the nationalists, including
                    massacres. The consulate was in a difficult position because we were under
                    surveillance all the time. Yet we had to have contacts with the Taiwanese. We
                    tried to discourage them from coming to our homes where they might be arrested.
                    We would meet them casually in a variety of places.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The nationalists were pretty tough.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROSS: They were, but they were also tough on their own members. Any sign of
                    doubt, particularly if it might result in a defection, was immediately
                    squelched. The Nationalists had learned a lesson from their experiences on the
                    Mainland. Even today, in China, you will find people who will do the right
                    thing. Then and now, these people find ways of doing what they consider right
                    even if the authorities don't permit it. They will pursue their education
                    regardless.</p>
                <p>There were some who worked for the Joint Commission for Rural Reconstruction
                    (JCRR) - a joint American-Chinese endeavor which had been in existence on the
                    mainland and was continued on Taiwan. They proceeded without government support
                    and developed a land distribution program which became one of the most effective
                    U.S. assistance programs anywhere in the world.</p>
                <p>I think that the top KMT officials behaved in one way, while some of their
                    subordinates behaved somewhat differently. Then there were the Taiwanese. The
                    more enlightened KMT officials and the Taiwanese began to meet and slowly the
                    two began to merge. That is the situation today; Taiwan has a Taiwanese
                    president.</p>

                <p>CROSS: She taught at Taiwan Nationalist University - a large school. She taught
                    American literature - novels. There were no American novels available on the
                    island, so she typed out the “Red Badge of Courage” on a little typewriter and
                    made 14 copies. Her classroom was without a ceiling - it had been blown up; a
                    tarp was used instead. She also participated in an English language radio
                    program; she was “Mrs. Chase.” The role of a Mr. Lee was played by David Osborn,
                    who at the time was also employed by USIS. The core theme of the program was
                    that Mrs. Chase would meet Mr. Lee some place where they held a conversation.
                    They would pronounce the words slowly at first and then in normal rhythm. At the
                    start, they had no audience. After two or three broadcasts, their listeners
                    totaled 20-30,000.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CROSS: The Dutch had just transferred sovereignty to the Indonesians. So we
                    entered a very unsettled atmosphere. Some questions were unresolved; for
                    example, people were trying to figure out what to do with the Dutch army - in
                    fact, a battalion of so-called native troops who were being given a choice of
                    going to Holland or joining the Indonesian Army. That caused a lot of
                    friction.</p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>Then there were some Dutch renegades running around. The day we arrived in
                    Jakarta, a Tunco Westerling, one of the renegades, cut the road from the port to
                    the city. So we were stuck in the port for most of the day before the embassy
                    could rescue us.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was our role in the founding of the new country of
                        Indonesia?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROSS: The U.S. had a “good offices” role. The thrust for independence started
                    with VJ day. On August 17, 1945, Sukarno declared Indonesia an independent
                    state. The Dutch had no troops on the archipelago. So the British Ghurkas
                    arrived primarily to capture the Japanese. But Sukarno, who had been essentially
                    a Japanese creation, and his men scrounged for arms and resisted the Ghurkas
                    briefly. Then the Dutch arrived with their troops and began to arm their
                    Indonesian supporters.</p>
                <p>Indonesia is a huge country spread out for thousands of miles over innumerable
                    islands. In 1948, a “good offices” committee was formed - I believe under UN
                    auspices. The Indonesians were allowed to choose a member and they selected
                    Australia. The Dutch chose Belgium. The two chosen countries then asked the U.S.
                    to join them as the third party. We sent a cruiser - the “Grenville” - which was
                    the name then given to the agreements that the Indonesians and the Dutch finally
                    signed. These agreements moved Indonesia gradually towards independence. So we
                    did play a “good offices” role.</p>
                <p>By the time we arrived, these various accords were being implemented. It was a
                    fascinating time because we were then beginning to be engaged with the
                    Indonesians in their efforts at nation building.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Were there many expatriate Dutch and what was their
                        attitudtowards us?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROSS: There were a lot of expatriates who were rather bitter about the U.S. Many
                    of them had been prisoners in Japanese camps; they were bitter about the
                    treatment they had received there. Many, of course, had led a good life in their
                    300-years old colony; they found it hard to give that up. The younger and more
                    modern settlers and those who had arrived more recently from Holland were more
                    far-sighted and understood the direction the world was taking. But I think
                    almost all of the Dutch wondered why the U.S. was forcing them to surrender
                    their colony. They thought we were their friend; they had supported us in the
                    war - to the extent they could. I pointed out that we had liberated their mother

                </p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>CROSS: USIS was headed by Willard Hanna. He was probably the most informed
                    officer in the embassy. He had made an extraordinary number of friends - some of
                    them very senior Indonesian officials - who kept him up-to-date on goings on.
                    The Dutch were mad at him all the time. After the transfer of power, Hanna was
                    very close to the top - people like Sukarno and Suton Sjahrir - the leader of
                    the socialist party. Sjahrir eventually was shoved aside by Sukarno, but at the
                    beginning he was quite influential. As a member of the USIS staff, we were part
                    of Hanna's network. For instance, I took movies into the hinterlands; we
                    couldn't go very far because of security considerations, but we certainly were
                    welcomed wherever we went.</p>
                <p>I worked on several publications. We had on our staff one of the top Indonesian
                    journalists; we produced a news pamphlet mostly about the U.S., but including
                    some general subjects. It was written in Bahasa Indonesian, which was the
                    language most used throughout the country. We had government support for this
                    publication, so that our Indonesian editor was in effect teaching the
                    Indonesians how to use what was to be the official language. The Indonesian
                    government was trying to do the same thing, but couldn't match what we were
                    putting out. So we were close to the leading lights of the new country.</p>
                <p>We also worked very closely with the development of the educational system. We
                    were in at the start of the university system. The Dutch had a different system
                    from the French; only the very best Indonesian students were admitted to Dutch
                    institutions for advanced education so that the Indonesians were quite deficient
                    in people with advanced degrees, such as doctors, etc.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had we started bringing Indonesians to the U.S. for
                        training?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROSS: I was for a brief period responsible for the exchange program. We had
                    begun to seek potential exchange students, but I don't remember now whether the
                    first had gone to the U.S. by the time I left Jakarta. We did spend considerable
                    time on the leader program; I think we did build a program base for exchanges
                    and training which did become quite successful. Hanna was a great proponent of
                    these kinds of programs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the ambassador during your tour?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROSS: H. Merle Cochran. He had been the Treasury attach� in Paris for seventeen
                    years. Then he became the chief of the Foreign Service Inspection Corps during
                    the war.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did he fit into this rapidly changing and
                        developinsituation? How did he run the embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>CROSS: He didn't run the embassy all that well. His main concern was to insure
                    that the U.S. - and its representatives - did not become too involved in the
                    Indonesian struggles. He was continually concerned with us taking on more than
                    we could deliver. He opposed the growth of the staff, partly because all of us
                    had to live in the same hotel, at least when he first arrived. Later we did
                    disperse, but initially, the accommodations were Spartan. Cochran was an
                    old-line, very conservative guy. He later became deputy director of the IMF. He
                    was a very good financial analyst. He did not support assistance per se; he was
                    not enthusiastic about technical assistance, in part I assume, because it would
                    have expanded the American presence in Indonesia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the embassy staff?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROSS: The DCM for most of our tour was Jake Beam. He had come from serving on
                    Secretary Marshall's staff - what is now known as S/S. He had a German
                    background in the Foreign Service. I was told (by Beam) that he got into trouble
                    with Marshall because Marshall had insisted that a policy issue be presented on
                    one sheet of paper which at the bottom gave the Secretary the opportunity to
                    vote “Yes” or “No.” So the policy question had to be phrased in such a way that
                    it could be answered either in the affirmative or the negative. Jake sent a memo
                    to the secretary which ended in the customary “Yes”or “No” fashion, but he added
                    the words “Don't Know” as a third option. That didn't sit too well with the
                    Secretary, who told Beam that one should not make fun of U.S. policy. So that
                    the next thing he knew was that he was assigned to Indonesia, despite his long
                    background in Europe. He was a great guy. He used to serve “beamlets,” gimlets
                    in drinking glasses [tumblers].</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Later he became our ambassador to Poland, Czechoslovakia
                        and thSoviet Union. Did you have any hard charging, more junior

                </p>
                <p>CROSS: I think we had a first rate staff. The political officer was Frank
                    Galbraith, who also later became an ambassador to Indonesia. He became one of my
                    best friends in the Foreign Service. He had gone to Yale to learn Indonesian at
                    the same time I was there; the Galbraiths took us under their wing when we
                    arrived in Jakarta. The economic section included Coby Swank, later our
                    ambassador to Cambodia. Fred Farnsworth was the administrative officer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the staff, despite the ambassador's views, mix with

                </p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>CROSS: Most of the outreach was done by USIS. We were very good at that, if I may
                    say so. We were more unrestricted than the embassy people, but, example, Frank
                    Galbraith was superb. He built a whole network of embassy contacts. Coby had to
                    deal primarily with what was left of the Dutch infrastructure; the Indonesian
                    follow-ons knew something about economics but were obviously inexperienced.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the Indonesian government like when you
                        arrived?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROSS: It was just getting started. Many of the top jobs were still held by
                    Dutch, some of whom were very conscientious and others were not. The Dutch did
                    what they always had done and now at the same time also trained Indonesians.
                    Some did that seriously; others were not so helpful. The security situation was
                    very “iffy” much of the time. There were a lot of guerrilla groups still
                    operating in areas not under the control of the government's forces.</p>
                <p>There was a question whether Indonesia would be a unitary state or a federal
                    state. Indonesia is populated by many different people and cultures; the
                    predominantly Muslim areas, such as Java and Sumatra, were viewed as separate
                    entities; the Sulawesi was not a majority Muslim area. These tensions were
                    resolved while we were there when it was decided to make all of the islands into
                    a single unitary entity.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned the security problem. What was it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROSS: The Dutch troops were leaving on schedule, so they were not concerned with
                    the country's security. The Indonesia army was not all that well disciplined; it
                    included forces that had been commanded by the Dutch whose loyalty was not
                    certain. Then there were just plain bandits running around all over the place.
                    At one time, a Yale professor by the name of Kennedy was shot near Bandung. A
                    couple of our friends were shot and stabbed. The embassy itself was
                    unmolested.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did these various groups inhibit your work at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROSS: We really didn't have any major problems because we were well briefed on
                    where we could go and where we couldn't. I traveled throughout the country
                    because my focus was really on the Overseas Chinese. They had their own
                    problems; they were mistreated by the Indonesians - in some cases, something
                    like pogroms. In some instances, the Mainland struggles between the KMT and the
                    Communists were reflected in the Indonesian Chinese community; because of that,
                    I spent a lot of time in that community.</p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>Q: By this time, the Chinese civil war was over and we were looking at the
                    Chinese communists as a major threat. Was your work influenced by this?</p>
                <p>CROSS: The People's Republic of China (PRC) had established an embassy in
                    Jakarta. It was very active with the same groups with whom we had contacts -
                    Chinese language newspapers and schools. The KMT had some very good
                    representatives either from the mainland or Taiwan to work with the Overseas
                    Chinese community. There was a lot of infighting between the KMT and the
                    communist representatives for the souls of the Overseas Chinese.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we viewing the PRC as the enemy at this point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROSS: Certainly. As far as we were concerned, the Cold War was going full blast
                    and the Chinese Communists were on the other team. This made it very difficult
                    for the Overseas Chinese who depended essentially on foreign protection to save
                    their lives and goods from the Indonesians. While the Dutch were there, the
                    Chinese had their protection; when the Dutch left, they had to look towards the
                    PRC, which was a formidable power in the Far East. The communists used this
                    opportunity to rouse the Overseas Chinese to their side.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you were in Jakarta, what was our embassy's
                        impression oSukarno?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROSS: I think he was viewed as a demagogic person who was very charismatic. He
                    was favorably disposed to the U.S. as well as to most other countries. He was
                    trying to move Indonesia into the non-aligned world. However, from the very
                    beginning, I think the embassy had serious reservations about Sukarno's ability
                    to lead his country into the modern world. It should be noted that for the first
                    few years of his reign, Sukarno was very busy consolidating his power, including
                    military sweeps of some parts of the archipelago to put down the dissidents. He
                    was also trying to acquire the western part of New Guinea (Irian Jaya). That
                    consumed his public appearances, and he wished to avoid being involved in the
                    battles of the Communists and Nationalists among the Overseas Chinese.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was Sukarno's rationale for wishing to incorporate
                        Irian intIndonesia?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROSS: Irian had been a Dutch colony; so the Indonesians felt that when the Dutch
                    left Indonesia, they should also leave Irian and turn that over to the
                    Indonesians. Of course, Irian was not a free standing island like those that
                    composed Indonesia, but only part of an island.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the Communist Party (PKI) active while you were in

                </p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>CROSS: It had been badly defeated in 1946 during a battle that was fought between
                    it and the Indonesian republican forces. One of the PKI's leaders was captured
                    and shot. So after that, the PKI was not really a force, although Sukarno
                    watched the communists carefully and worried about their connection with the
                    Chinese and the Soviet Union. But both of those communist countries were very
                    careful about their relationship to the PKI; they were much more interested in
                    developing a close connection with Sukarno. In those days, he did not align
                    himself with the communist world; he was much more interested in becoming a
                    leader of the non-aligned world. In the end, of course, he became too close to
                    the communists and was unseated.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you aware of anything that CIA was doing in

                </p>
                <p>CROSS: While I was in Jakarta, the CIA was just getting started. The first
                    station chief was an odd duck who would often chase the waiters around the
                    garden of his residence. He drank heavily. His cover position was that of
                    Treasury Attache. I don't think much happened during my tour in Indonesia; the
                    station was moving along slowly, but surely, in its infancy stage.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CROSS: It was not; I was the only Chinese expert in the embassy and therefore not
                    a focus of any investigations. You have to remember that by 1950, all government
                    employees had to pass a loyalty test, which had been implemented by the Truman
                    administration. It was a rather thorough security check. This program brought to
                    light some notorious cases of espionage, like Klaus Fuchs and the Rosenbergs.
                    McCarthy just picked up the Truman program, in part, I believe, because that
                    program was beginning to dissipate. The senator began his own investigations
                    because the Truman loyalty program was not doing all McCarthy thought it should
                    be doing. I will have more to say about McCarthy and his program when we get to
                    some of my future assignments.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CROSS: I don't remember anything special happening because of the Korean War. I
                    do recall being somewhat concerned because I was in the Marine Corps reserve; if
                    any one should have been called up, it should have been me since I spoke
                    Chinese. But I wasn't. The Indonesian government, I think, supported the UN in
                    its actions on the Korean Peninsula. But I am not sure how the Indonesians might
                    have reacted had the war broken out a couple of years later, by which time, the
                    Indonesians were not that wed to us or the West; they were concerned that we
                    might somehow take away their independence. We also became a convenient whipping
                    boy for Sukarno when he wanted to distract his people from any domestic
                    concerns. But I don't remember the Indonesians making much of the Korean
                    War.</p>

                <p>CROSS: We did a lot of outreach to the Indonesians. Both Frank Galbraith and I
                    had an American friend who was a movie distributor. He lived near the Punjak. He
                    used to lend his house in the hills for weekend retreats by embassy officers. He
                    was never bothered by bandits because he used to show movies on an outdoor
                    screen the villagers watched; and they, in fact, became a protecting power for
                    the distributor.</p>
                <p>One time, we went to this village together with Mechtar Lubis, the editor of
                    Merdeka, and Rusian Amwar, also in the newspaper business, and I think there was
                    a third Indonesian involved in media; so it was Frank and I and those three
                    Indonesians. The five of us spent the whole weekend talking about the state of
                    the world. It was very hard for Americans not to mistake Indonesian politeness
                    and smoothness for agreement; the Malays are the same way. You have to get
                    behind this veneer to see where the tensions really lie. Indonesians liked
                    casual conversations; they liked to laugh a lot and therefore enjoyed jokes.</p>

                <p>CROSS: We had some visitors. I remember one delegation headed by a State
                    Department man which was sent to see what kind of assistance we might be able to
                    provide. There was Congressional input into that mission. But there weren't many
                    Congressmen who at the time cared about Indonesia. In any case, even if there
                    had been visitors, I don't think I would have seen them, being the most junior
                    officer in USIS.</p>

                <p>CROSS: No, I was much more interested in political work and reporting. In some
                    sense, my work with the Overseas Chinese community was political in nature. I
                    wrote quite a few reports on Overseas Chinese in different places in Indonesia.
                    I sent those through Frank Galbraith and the embassy's political section.</p>

                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>CROSS: Yes, although much depended to which generation they belonged to and
                    perhaps their economic status. The appeal of a victorious, successful China was
                    very strong, even to those who had been born in Indonesia. There were really
                    three groups of overseas Chinese: a) the descendants of those who had emigrated
                    to Indonesia a long time ago - most of them had come from South China as
                    laborers for the Dutch and then had worked their way up the economic ladder to
                    be small shop owners or what were called “native managers.” They were well
                    established. Some of them had lost their Chineseness - had become Muslim, etc.
                    This group stopped supporting Chinese schools in Indonesia.</p>
                <p>The second group had arrived in Indonesia in the early part of the 20th Century.
                    They were workers in the tin mines and other extracting industries. They were
                    more China-oriented. Some of this group had graduated from being workers and had
                    accumulated sufficient funds to found Chinese language schools. They lived in
                    typical overseas Chinese enclaves all over the country. These people were the
                    victims of periodic pogroms conducted by the Indonesians. They were careful
                    about their support of the PRC, in part because originally they had been members
                    of the KMT. Some of the richer overseas Chinese were shaken down by the KMT and
                    had to pay some tribute.</p>
                <p>The third group were people had fled the 1930s travails of China just before and
                    immediately after WW II. These people felt much closer to China than the other
                    two groups.</p>
                <p>Q: How successful were you in getting close to the Overseas Chinese?</p>
                <p>CROSS: I worked very closely with people who had been sent to Indonesia from
                    Taiwan. I think they were successful in maintaining good relations with the
                    Overseas Chinese until the Indonesians began to block the publication of Chinese
                    language newspapers. The theory in the Overseas Chinese community was that
                    unless a large power protected them, they would become victims of the
                    Indonesians.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CROSS: No, but Ambassador Merle Cochran knew that Sukarno did not want the PRC to
                    become too influential in Indonesia. By the same token, he did not want the U.S.
                    to be engaged in a struggle with the PRC on Indonesian soil. Sukarno didn't want
                    us flying the Cold War flag in his country. Cochran talked to Hanna who told me
                    to concentrate on just learning about the Overseas Chinese and not to engage in
                    anything that might be construed as propaganda.</p>

                <p>CROSS: We went to Hong Kong; we arrived there February or March, 1952. We stayed
                    there until April 1954. I was still in USIS. I worked with Chinese refugees who
                    had just escaped the PRC. We had a book translation program which had been
                    started by Dick McCarthy - he was also an FSO. He thought that much could be
                    done to strengthen the Chinese refugees by a) providing them with reading
                    material and b) providing them jobs as translators. We built up a network and
                    managed to translate and publish a lot of good books - all anti communist - e.g.
                    Koestler's “Darkness at Noon.”</p>
                <p>I was also editor for a while of a magazine called World Today which had enough
                    attractions in it to develop a good readership. It also had an anti-communist
                    bent. It was distributed to Overseas Chinese as well as residents of Hong Kong.
                    This magazine soon reached a circulation of approximately 125,000 people.</p>
                <p>I also participated in “China watching” by working on the weekly summary of
                    Chinese propaganda. The theory was that a good “China watcher” could predict
                    what might happen in the PRC by reading carefully the instructions that were
                    issued to the Chinese propaganda cadres - e.g. “This is the way this subject
                    should be discussed now”, etc. I remember the instructions concerning land
                    reform which gave a clear sign of communist intentions and what should be said
                    at each stage of the land reform process. The same steps were followed for all
                    the mass propaganda programs and you could tell what the final objectives were
                    by how the propagandists were instructed to “spin” them and the slogans to
                    use.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Please explain what “China watching” was.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROSS: I compare “China watching” to an ornithologist at the edge of a woods. We
                    were looking into China from the outside. We depended heavily on those countries
                    that had missions in Beijing as well as Chinese media output. Part of our task
                    was to acquire - against the rules - material from inside China. We would read
                    it and translate or summarize that which we considered important. We surveyed
                    the PRC's press on a daily basis and submitted digests of that. The articles to
                    be highlighted were chosen by the Chinese language officers in Hong Kong and
                    then translated by our superb Chinese staff. In those days, these translations
                    and summaries had to be sent back to Washington, but we would also make them
                    available to selected newspaper reporters and scholars. But the principal use of
                    these efforts was for analytical purposes, to see whether we could divine what
                    was going on inside the PRC. “China watching” was a full-scale occupation for a
                    large number of people, not only for the U.S. but for members of other
                    countries' consulates in Hong Kong. We would occasionally discuss the available
                    information with other diplomats.</p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>On the economic front, we had a rather sizeable staff doing analysis of China's
                    economy. When I joined the Hong Kong consulate, this whole “China watching”
                    exercise was relatively new. But we were able to watch developments over a
                    period of years. For example, the land reform movement that I mentioned earlier
                    came to a conclusion while I was still in Hong Kong.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tell us a little about this land reform movement.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROSS: Simply put, the communists appropriated the land owned by the landlords
                    and gave it to the landless. They shot many of the landlords and divided up
                    their holdings. The communists would first hold meetings during which
                    accusations would be made against the landlords and their “brutal treatment” of
                    the peasants. Then meetings would be held on how the property would be split.
                    The first step of the Chinese communist policy was to redistribute land; the
                    next step was to form cooperatives which eventually led to the formation of
                    communes. The commune program was part of the Great Leap Forward. It was poorly
                    developed and miserably implemented, resulting in the late 1950s and early
                    1960s, in one of the greatest famines in history.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During your tour, 1952-54, what was the consulate's
                        impression oCommunist China?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROSS: We had a very clear idea of how ruthless and cruel the Chinese were.
                    However, we still felt that the country was not falling apart and that people
                    were working on problems. This was a period when it appeared that China was
                    using all of its people and charging ahead.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, the Chinese we knew in Hong Kong were giving us a different
                    perspective. I think, in some cases, we didn't consider their views seriously
                    enough. We viewed these Chinese as refugees who were bound to have serious
                    misgivings about the Communist regime. In the final analysis, I am not sure that
                    our neglect had any serious impact on our conclusions about the PRC. We did
                    report what we were told, although as I suggested, we might well have indicated
                    some skepticism.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CROSS: That was just one more interesting aspect of the Far East situation. We
                    were living in Hong Kong, a bastion of a free society - totally free economy -
                    right next door to the most communist country in the world. Great Britain had
                    troops in Korea, while running a part of China - Hong Kong - which it had
                    wrested a century earlier - and which could be wrested away from it by the PRC
                    without a moment's notice. Yet we did not think that the PRC would take any
                    precipitous steps or, on the other hand, that Hong Kong would become the
                    economic gem of the Far East that it did.</p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>There is one important fact about Great Britain's participation in the Korean
                    war. It had considerable impact on the economic well being of Hong Kong. Before
                    WWII, Hong Kong was just a “godown” on the China coast. Its only claim to fame
                    was that it was under British rule. The British used Shanghai as their main
                    trading post. The trade used to flow between Shanghai and Tianjin and other
                    treaty ports. These trade routes were protected by foreign troops. The trade was
                    primarily intra-China led by large foreign companies.</p>
                <p>Then came WWII; the West lost its extra-territorial privileges in the Chinese
                    treaty ports. Nevertheless, the intra-China trading policy still prevailed, and
                    Hong Kong was looked at as part of this old trading pattern; i.e. part of the
                    intra-China trade, not as an entry point for trade between China and the rest of
                    the world.Then came the Korean war and the UN embargo. That barred Hong Kong
                    from exporting goods that were made on the mainland; they had to be manufactured
                    in Hong Kong itself. So it lost some connection with the PRC; but at the same
                    time, it became a major exporter of its own wares to the rest of the world.
                    Manufacturing increased sharply as Hong Kong discovered that its goods were in
                    high demand, and that was really the birth of Hong Kong's economic boom.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CROSS: I don't think the Chinese in Hong Kong liked British rule very much, but
                    on the other hand, they didn't want to join the PRC either. Most of them had
                    already voted on that choice with their feet; they had fled Mainland China. The
                    British gave them the rule of law, which was consistent and transparent. The
                    Chinese may have chafed at British rule, but I think they appreciated the
                    security and confidence the British brought them, not to mention that it brought
                    a rising standard of living for most of them.</p>

                <p>CROSS: He was and he wasn't. He had been stationed in China but, for example,
                    didn't speak any Chinese. He was a good consul general; he was a “cool cat.” He
                    had been kicked out of Shanghai where he had been the deputy to Consul General
                    Cabot - of the well known Boston family. Cabot was a tall, stuffy man; he got
                    out of Shanghai in time, leaving a skeleton staff to watch the communist
                    takeover. The Chinese immediately made everything difficult for the consulate
                    general; the Chinese employees began to be very demanding.Walter was a good
                    consul general. I liked him a lot. He had an old fashioned Foreign Service
                    ability of not taking notes but remembering all conversations almost verbatim.
                    He would then commit them to paper.</p>
                <p>The staff of the consulate general was very good, especially the “China
                    watchers.” We had a fellow by the name of Howie Borman, who left the service
                    long ago. He was a prot�g� of Edmund Clubb, a legendary linguist who served
                    several years in Beijing before and after the war. Howie knew about Chinese
                    leaders thoroughly, even though he was a relatively junior officer. His main
                    stock in trade, and one that he worked on very hard, was to know the biography
                    of every Communist leader. He was the father of this esoteric program which
                    subsequently became a major stock in trade for the Foreign Service. He also
                    established the press monitoring system. Ralph Clough, now a teacher at SAIS,
                    was there; he was the head of the political section. Doak Barnett was there as
                    well as Art Hummel. On the economic side, we had John Heidemann.</p>
                <p>The Chinese language speakers were Hummel and to a lesser extent, me. We had
                    people who were quite fluent in the language; they also were skilled in dealing
                    with the Chinese. I think this was a period in Hong Kong when we were best
                    staffed for reporting on events in the PRC.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CROSS: Yes indeed, although I think I would have put the question in reverse. It
                    is we who had to work well with them. We had a superb Chinese staff who produced
                    these publications; the role of the American supervisors was essentially to
                    determine which products would be included in the publications. But I think we
                    all worked together as a team. For example, working with USIS was a “Union
                    Press” group called the “Third Force” people. They kept looking for a third
                    power center, somewhere between Chiang Kai-shek and the communists. They were
                    mainly graduates of Peking University who had fled China one way or another.
                    They formed teaching groups, drama groups, a research group which is now known
                    as the “University Research Center” in Hong Kong. It provided raw material -
                    clippings and other written information - on what was going on in China. This

                <p>CROSS: There were a lot of developments in the PRC. The Korean war came to an end
                    in this time frame. There were a number of foolish things that the PRC was doing
                    - e.g. accusing the U.S. of conducting germ warfare. They would show things that
                    looked like large canisters with flies crawling over them. That was what we
                    intended to drop on the Chinese people. People who should have known better
                    believed this propaganda - international scientists like Joseph Needham who had
                    written a history of Chinese science. He maintained to a group of fellow
                    travelers that we were dropping those canisters.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CROSS: I don't think so, because even with the end of the war, there was no
                    improvement in the Sino-U.S. relationship. I left in 1954 when Dulles was just
                    finishing his “ring of containment” - Korea, Japan, Taiwan, the Phillippines,
                    SEATO, etc. So by that year, we were fully committed to the independence of
                    Taiwan.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CROSS: There always was that feeling of uncertainty. The British were very
                    cautious; they went out of their way not to antagonize the PRC but were at the
                    same time quite firm about their rights in Hong Kong. They tried to make sure
                    that no aspect of the Chinese civil war would take place in Hong Kong. They were
                    not entirely successful. The KMT organized thousands and thousands refugees who
                    would demonstrate whenever called upon. The communists organized the labor units
                    who would periodically take to the streets for demonstrations. The British would
                    squelch all demonstrations as quickly as possible.</p>

                <p>CROSS: I worked with the British Information Service. I think others worked even
                    more closely with the British than I. But I am not sure how much we shared with
                    the British. They did consider Hong Kong as part of their empire; the governor
                    was part of the British Colonial Service. By my second tour, the governor was a
                    member of the British Foreign Service, perhaps representing some change in the
                    British view of Hong Kong.</p>
                <p>The British were very security conscious. They were very tough on anything that
                    might have weakened security, including even, for example, our relationships
                    with the KMT in Hong Kong.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CROSS: I returned to Washington to become a member of the USIA Policy Planning
                    Staff. That assignment was given to me principally because the personnel people
                    were trying to get me back into the regular Foreign Service. The job dealt
                    primarily with China; it was not very exciting. The only thing I remember about
                    that tour is that I stopped a propaganda ploy that we were going to perpetrate
                    by publicizing a famine that was taking place on the Mainland. Some of the
                    policy makers wanted to offer food to the PRC, knowing well it would be refused
                    and that we really would not come through even if accepted. But the refusal
                    would be played up as a sign of the tyranny of the PRC. This ploy seemed to be
                    so childish to me that I could hardly believe that it had in fact reached very
                    senior levels in the Agency. I wrote a strong dissent in part because in Asia,
                    making fun of people's hunger was viewed very negatively and the ploy would
                    prove counter-productive. Fortunately, the decision makers took my side.</p>
                <p>Mostly I worked on material that praised Taiwan and that denigratethe PRC.</p>

                <p>CROSS: Right, and I'll explain in a minute how that transfer camabout. But first
                    of all, I want to talk about McCarthy and his pursuits.</p>
                <p>When I arrived back in Washington, I was first debriefed. On the second to last
                    day of that, as I was preparing to go on home leave, I entered the offices on
                    Pennsylvania Avenue. I was stopped by a dapper man with pointed shoes who
                    declared himself to be a member of some old family from Virginia. Shortly after,
                    he told me that he was a personnel officer. I am not sure why the connection,
                    but it was made. As I was entering the elevator, this fellow asked that I go
                    with him to his office. There he asked if I could replace a Bob Catto right awa-
                    the job to which in fact I had been assigned. I said that I thought Bob was not
                    leaving for four or five weeks to his next post. I saw no reason why I should
                    give up my home leave under that kind of time schedule. The personnel guy said
                    that plans had changed and that Catto was resigning that day.</p>
                <p>In fact, I had been told that Catto was through before they had even told him. I
                    discovered that when, after my conversation with the personnel man, I went to
                    Catto's office where I overheard a telephone conversation that he was having
                    with that personnel man. In that conversation, he agreed to come down to the
                    personnel office right away. It was obvious that his termination would be
                    announced then; so I was told of Catto's fate before he had been.</p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>I went off for about an hour to some other office. When I returned to say goodbye
                    to him, I found the office empty; he had come back from his conversation with
                    the personnel office, cleaned out his desk and left. He hadn't said anything to
                    anyone. I tried to figure out why this had happened; I could only surmise that
                    he was terminated because in Taipei, where he was in 1947, he had been
                    particularly friendly with a Taiwanese individual during the worst part of the
                    massacres perpetrated by the KMT.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That suggests that the axe was falling not only on those

                </p>
                <p>CROSS: That is right. If you were not an ardent Chiang Kai-shek supporter, you
                    were - as seen by the KMT - suspect. Their views were incorporated into the
                    American loyalty system and translated that anyone not pro-Chiang Kai-shek
                    obviously was pro-communist. Neutrality was not acceptable. That is what
                    happened to Catto.</p>
                <p>Only a few weeks later, Elizabeth Maurer, who had been a member of the Institute
                    for Pacific Relations - or some organization with a similar name - was fingered
                    as a suspect. It didn't make any difference that this institute had been
                    financed by the Rockefellers.</p>
                <p>She had worked for them as a rather low-level person; she also had been in the
                    old OWI (Office of War Information). We were going out for lunch; we had a
                    practice that most of the USIA employees would go for lunch at the same time. We
                    would go across the street to the Roger Smith hotel - or even cheaper
                    eateries.</p>
                <p>When we went to pick her up for lunch; affixed to her old typewriter was a note
                    to all of us which said that she liked working with us and that she thought we
                    were all good people. She wished us good luck and bid us goodbye. She had also
                    just quit - presumably under some threat. We never had the slightest hint.
                    Employees were not given much time to clear their desks and leave. They were
                    often threatened with a long and prolonged loyalty review process; they were
                    also told or suspected that if the review proved to be negative - as it was
                    likely to be - there was no recourse and that they would have to leave with a
                    blemished record, thereby severely damaging their possibilities for another good
                    job.</p>

                <p>CROSS: It was demoralizing because the Foreign Service gossip - to which I had
                    probably become unnecessarily addicted - would whisper that Mr or Ms so-and-so
                    was in some sort of trouble or he or she didn't get a particular assignment
                    because they were under suspicion. This speculation, along with the persistent
                    charges by McCarthy, created an atmosphere of suspicion and people began to
                    watch each other. The grapevine, as I suggested, was vicious; people would
                    gossip about what they heard from or about others; innocent statements were
                    warped into “disloyal” comments. People became very careful about their
                    words.</p>
                <p>It is not often noted that the Republican administration employed well known
                    “security experts” who had pretty much of a free hand in the Department because
                    John Foster Dulles wanted to have no part in this activity. So we had
                    professional security people inspecting the Foreign Service. That radically
                    changed the atmosphere which lasted for many years.</p>
                <p>Personally, I was too young to have “lost China.” In fact, by thtime I got to
                    Taipei, the U.S. had given up on China anyway.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think you might call these “professional security” types
                        as cops.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROSS: You might, although we have to recognize that these people were really not
                    security people as we would define the term today. They were not trained in
                    security processes. They were essentially retreads from ordinary police forces
                    or Army Intelligence or other organizations like that. But they had Republican
                    party connections and furthermore soon developed their own network so that they
                    supported each other in their work.</p>
                <p>Q: It must have been an unhappy marriage under any circumstances in that the
                    Foreign Service was interested in stimulating analysis and the security types
                    were neanderthals who really viewed “brains” with some suspicion.</p>
                <p>CROSS: There was a snobbishness in the Foreign Service which simply rejected
                    these security people even when they joined the Department and the Foreign
                    Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your job?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROSS: The Information Agency had a policy planning staff which reported directly
                    to the USIA director - Ted Streibert. I was assigned to that as were Monty
                    Stearns and Pat O'Sheel, who later went to Cairo and other places. We were the
                    three FSOs on that staff. Eventually, we all were reassigned from USIA into
                    Foreign Service positions.</p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>We had to clear a lot of our policy initiatives with the Department. That added
                    some extra unnecessary steps to the process. But since USIA had been sponsored
                    by Dulles, it became necessary for its own officers to work in its headquarters,
                    rather than using some in Departmental offices such as Public Affairs.</p>
                <p>When I was about to be reassigned from USIA, Oscar Armstrong was leaving Kuala
                    Lumpur. I was asked whether I wanted to replace him. I was absolutely delighted
                    because this was a political officer's job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While you were in USIA, did you feel the hand of Walter
                        Robertson (assistant secretary for Far East in State Department)?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROSS: Part of the job was to insure that USIA programs supported State
                    Department policy, meaning support of Chiang Kai-shek and opposition to the
                    communists. In fact, that was our only policy, which tied our hands, leaving
                    little room for gray areas.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you or any of the other younger officers have any

                </p>
                <p>CROSS: I think we all had doubts whether our allegiance to Chiang was the best
                    course for the U.S. in the long run. But I had just been in Hong Kong, which I
                    suspect pretty much prejudiced me against the Communists. I felt that the KMT
                    was certainly marginally better then the communists, but I didn't think that it
                    was that great either. I hoped that sometime in the future, we would find some
                    way to have better relations with the PRC, but I certainly had no bright ideas
                    of how to proceed down that track. The Communists were difficult to deal with,
                    even if the academics of the day were still maintaining that the strains between
                    the two countries were as much our fault, if not more. I did not share that view
                    at all.</p>
                <p>Q: Other people have told me that Mao and his government were using the U.S. as a
                    whipping boy to get to their goals, whatever they may have been. Then came the
                    “Great Leap Forward” and other communist initiatives which did not leave much
                    time for the PRC to worry about its external relations.</p>
                <p>CROSS: There was a brief period in the early 1950s when the Chinese were trying
                    to develop a “united front” which might have made rapprochement between China
                    and the U.S. possible, although even then, internal struggles predominated in
                    China - e.g. all the landlords were being shot. In fact, I think for several
                    decades after WWII, the Chinese were so consumed with their internal struggles
                    that they had no time for any foreign relations. The period of the “Let 100
                    Flowers Bloom,” for example, was pure propaganda which blew up when the
                    Anti-Rightist Campaign started.</p>

                <p>CROSS: I don't think that was a possibility in the 1950s and early 1960s. It was
                    not possible to discuss such a possibility with Dulles. Our policy was clearly
                    to contain the PRC which, in fact, we did successfully.</p>

                <p>CROSS: It was the Federation of Malaya. I was there for a little more than two
                    years - winter of 1955 to the summer of 1957. As I said, I was the political
                    officer - the only one at that post. I covered the first elections, the
                    “Emergency” - i.e. counterinsurgency which I really learned on the ground - and
                    the negotiations for a new constitution. None of these were bilateral issues;
                    all were internal which left me with the major burden of reporting. We supported
                    the British as they were leaving the country. They left the country in good
                    order, quite stable after the “Emergency,” in the hands of a popularly elected
                    prime minister elected by the Malays and the eligible “Overseas” Chinese. That
                    person was Abdul Rahman who was the right person for the times - a very unusual

                        in 1955?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROSS: The communists began their full scale insurgency in 1948. They started
                    these activities at about the same time in India, Burma, Indonesia and Malaya.
                    The latter was the strongest movement because there it involved ethnic Chinese.
                    The peak of the insurgency was reached approximately in the 1950-51 period. Then
                    it began to de-escalate. So by the time we reached KL, there were already areas
                    designated as “White Areas,” mostly along the coast in such towns as Penang and
                    Malacca. Nevertheless, travel around the rest of the country required a convoy.
                    We had to have a convoy escort if we wanted to go from KL to the Cameron
                    Highlands. During our first few months, we needed a convoy to go from KL to
                    Malacca. But slowly, the government forces began to whittle away at the
                    insurgents.</p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>The government, as part of its counter-insurgency program, established what were
                    called “New Villages.” This was an idea of Sir Robert Thompson, who not only
                    established them in Malaya, but later was also instrumental in establishing the
                    same kinds of villages in Vietnam during our experiences there. There they were
                    called “Strategic Hamlets.” They were not that in Malaya because there the
                    government took the Chinese who were targets of the insurgents and moved them
                    away from the areas bordering the jungles which is where the insurgents
                    operated. The removal of these Chinese not only protected them, but also denied
                    the guerrillas easy access to food, medical supplies, and intelligence.</p>
                <p>So by the time we arrived in KL, the insurgents were in bad shape. The government
                    used a lot of tricks to defeat the insurgents. They infiltrated them with
                    government agents who then assisted the government forces in wiping out some
                    guerrilla units. In addition to these tricks, the government was offering
                    independence to the Malays and economic opportunities for young Chinese. While
                    the British were still in Malaya, they fought the insurgents. When they left,
                    the government used enticements as well as power to finish the insurgency. They
                    promised protection to the Chinese and pretty soon, the insurgency was no more.
                    Since my time in KL, there have been tensions between the Malays and the Chinese
                    from time to time, but they were managed without major recourse to violence. I
                    think the British did a great job; they kept the Malays united behind the idea
                    of cooperating with the Chinese while at the same time keeping the Chinese
                    united behind the idea that co-existence could take place if the Chinese who
                    made up the Malayan Communist Party ceased their insurgency.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I assume that our representation in KL was a consul
                        general. Diyou have many dealings with the British.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROSS: I did work in a consulate general. We dealt only with the British - or
                    Malay officials who were part of the British colonial government - there
                    primarily to train so that the new Malay government could function once the
                    British had withdrawn.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the election and the new constitution?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROSS: First, there was an election for parliament. This legislature was not
                    totally in charge, but it established a party structure for Malaysia. One party
                    was Negara, which was a Malay nationalist party. It lost the election to the
                    Alliance Party - a consortium of the united Malay National Organization, the
                    Malayan Chinese Association, and the Malayan Indian Association. The Alliance
                    was led by Abdul Rahman, whom I mentioned earlier. The Malays governed in those
                    areas that were primarily populated by Malays: the Chinese of the Malayan
                    Chinese Association did run in areas where the Malay might have been a small
                    majority and yet many of them won. So the Alliance swept this first election for
                    the new legislature.</p>

                        thatime?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROSS: I think we were great supporters. He was very personable. In some ways he
                    was like Reagan. He would say something, and it would be misinterpreted by some
                    people. He would never bat an eye and deny that he had said whatever he said.
                    The whole country knew his style; it never questioned his statements, but rather
                    praised him for sticking to his guns - whatever he really meant.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you ever have any contacts with the communist
                        insurgents?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROSS: Almost never. Every once in a while, the special branch would ask me to
                    interview a former member of the insurgent groups. These were not people who had
                    been imprisoned but rather had changed sides. Howie Schaffer and I watched one
                    of these operations once. We were on our way to call on the Sultan of Johore. We
                    were riding in the consul general's Chevy. On the way, we stopped for a night
                    and stayed with the chief of the Special Branch in a town which was still
                    surrounded by communist terrorists. We had a briefing about the local situation;
                    then the chief, who was a flamboyant Welshman, asked whether he could take our
                    car to carry some supplies to one of his patrols. Both Howie and I knew that our
                    bosses as well as the Special Branch higher ups would disapprove of any such use
                    of a CG vehicle. But we went happily anyway. We drove down narrow little roads -
                    lanes really - between rubber plantations and finally came to a rubber estate.
                    The high jungle really shades an area; it is practically dark if you are in it.
                    Nothing grows in it, but on the edge of such a jungle, there is some heavy
                    growth because the sunlight is able to shine there. That is called blukar.</p>
                <p>So we were driving along this lane and the Special Branch chief asked us to stop
                    somewhere along the road. He asked us to get out and lift up the hood of the car
                    to pretend we had car trouble. It was very quiet and all of the sudden there was
                    a whistle and a group of insurgents came out of the jungle. They had little red
                    stars on their caps. I was somewhat concerned because I didn't know what would
                    happen next. It turned out that this group was composed of former terrorists who
                    had been captured and had changed sides. They had to stay in the jungle for a
                    while - I guess to prove their bone fides - and then they were permitted to
                    re-enter society. While in the jungle, they were led by a British army
                    non-commissioned officer. The group was also accompanied by two Chinese Special
                    Branch members, all in their jungle get-ups. These groups would live in the
                    jungle for months on end, although the British leaders would change because they
                    could not remain in the jungle as long as the natives.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you spent a lot of time just observing what was going
                        on in thcountry?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>CROSS: Yes. We had no political differences with either the British government or
                    the Federation of Malaya. There may have been some discussions about the size of
                    our representation; it may have been larger than one might expect from a
                    consulate general, but that was because it soon would become an embassy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the consul general?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROSS: At the beginning it was Eric Kocher. He had been the labor attache in
                    Belgium and perhaps at another post before being assigned to Kuala Lumpur. He
                    was a very good political reporting officer. His wife, Peggy, was related to
                    Lillian Hellman - the playwright. Eric was very good with the staff; he
                    introduced me to Rahman the first week I was there. I was also helped greatly by
                    Oscar Armstrong, whom I replaced. He was also a son of China missionaries. Oscar
                    gave me a very good list of people whom I should contact, along with his own
                    ratings of these individuals. I also got a lot of help from Lucian Pye of MIT,
                    who had studied the communist movement and was an expert on its motivations.</p>
                <p>After Kocher came Ken Wright. He had been in the Navy prior to joining the
                    Service. He was very military minded; he liked everything to be neat and tidy,
                    as if we were going to be visited by a VIP. He used a lot of nautical
                    expressions. One that I found quite descriptive and useful was his
                    characterization of a bureaucratic impossibility: “You can't piss up a rope.” He
                    didn't like political reporting; he didn't like to write. So I became the
                    political reporting officer of the consulate general. If he had talked to
                    someone who might have had some interesting things to say, he would ask me to go
                    see the person and write something to send to the Department.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get to Singapore at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROSS: Yes, although we didn't do anything in Singapore. Elbridge Durbrow was the
                    consul general there. Technically, he was responsible for our operations in KL.
                    He would visit us periodically. He was always very friendly and helpful to me. I
                    think that the Singapore staff was more worried about Rahman than they were
                    about Lee Kuan Yew, even though the British saw the latter as potentially quite
                    dangerous. Lee played the game as it had to be played. Early on, he played
                    “footsie” with the Communists briefly in order to get control of the Overseas
                    Chinese on Singapore; when that was accomplished and the British left, he was
                    ruthless in eradicating the Communists.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left Malaysia in 1957. Did the Vietnam Geneva
                        Conference o1954 have any impact in Malaysia?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>CROSS: None whatsoever. I think the British felt that they had done extremely
                    well in Malaya, particularly with respect to the spread of communism to South
                    Asia. I think they in fact had done well. I should mention that I was asked to
                    stay in KL for another year, but I really didn't want to stay on in an embassy.
                    All of the Malay leadership were personal contacts; once the U.S. had an
                    ambassador, how could I as a lowly FSO-5 officer maintain those contacts?</p>
                <p>Egypt</p>
                <p>So in 1957, I was assigned to Alexandria, Egypt where I served for two years. I
                    had asked that I be transferred before the consulate general was turned into an
                    embassy because I really didn't want to be around when a more senior political
                    officer was assigned and when the political section would have grown - as well
                    as CIA. I really didn't have any interest in the Middle East, but I was told
                    that the then consul general was not very interested in the management of the
                    post and that the Department needed a good deputy for that consul general. This
                    was right after the Suez crisis which gave the assignment some additional
                    urgency.</p>
                <p>I tried a couple of inept “end- runs” around the personnel system, but they
                    didn't succeed. In retrospect, I am glad we went to Alexandria; we had a very
                    good time there. My boss was Hayward G. Hill - the large contributor to DACOR.
                    He was one of the nicest guys I have ever known, but he also was a living
                    example of the failure of the Foreign Service's “selection out” system. He
                    should have been “selected out” because he was essentially incompetent. He had
                    been born in Louisiana and spoke “Creole” French. He had served in Panama,
                    Havana, Geneva and several other posts. He had come to Alexandria from
                    Marseilles, which I think made it clear that this was going to be his last
                    assignment. Hill was very nice to me; he was a bachelor, so my wife Shirley had
                    to do much of the “hostess” work. He entertained very well, but it was usually
                    in spurts.</p>
                <p>As deputy principal officer, I really ran the post. I did all of the political
                    reporting - whatever little there was. I did all of the consular work. We did
                    have an economic officer - first Richard Adams, who was able to speak good
                    Arabic by the time he left - as well as good French. He was followed by Dirk
                    Gleysteen, who was much younger than I, but our families had been close in
                    Beijing. I had been at Yale with Culver, who was the oldest of the three
                    brothers in the Foreign Service. He was one of the last consuls in Dairen (now
                    rendered Dalian) in China, and one of the first in Leningrad. Culver focused on
                    the Soviet Union and China; Bill centered on the Far East and Dirk, the
                    youngest, took on the rest of the world. He served in Alexandria and Berlin, for
                    example.</p>
                <p>Q: You got to Alexandria a year after the Suez crisis. What were the
                    repercussions and what was the political situation in Egypt when you
                    arrived?</p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>CROSS: Nasser was still tightening his control over Egypt. Alexandria was a very
                    cosmopolitan society. It had its own centuries-old mystique of having been a
                    great city, but in decline. It was multilingual with French serving as the
                    social language, but all the key players spoke English and everyone spoke
                    Arabic. We were watched carefully by the regime, but it didn't really interfere
                    with our work. Alexandria had long been regarded as the center of opposition to
                    the regime. The former King Farouk had a lot of supporters in Alexandria.</p>
                <p>The international scene changed as far as Egypt was concerned. After we stopped
                    the British and French from invading Egypt to recapture the Suez Canal, then our
                    usefulness to Nasser was past. Since we refused to help him in the construction
                    of the Aswan Dam, the Soviets were invited to do so and accepted readily. The
                    U.S. decision was made around the time I arrived in Egypt.</p>
                <p>Nasser nationalized the Canal for reasons of his own, but it set much of the
                    world against him. We thought we could stabilize the situation and keep the
                    Soviets out of Egypt. And we might have been able to do so, except that the
                    British - Macmillan and Eden - were determined to show their “muscle.” So they
                    proceeded, irritating Eisenhower greatly. The Dam decision was really only one
                    of the several decisions made by the U.S. administration that affected our
                    relationships with Egypt. The Soviets agreed around this time to allow the
                    delivery of Czech arms in exchange for Egyptian cotton, thereby mortgaging the
                    harvest of that plant for a couple of years. The cotton was then dumped on the
                    European market by the Soviets, thus undermining the normal market.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CROSS: Much was made out of it in Egypt; we were often told by Egyptians of all
                    kinds that Dulles was rude or bad or whatever - never blaming Nasser for the
                    situation. It must be remembered that all Egyptians agreed, including Nasser's
                    opponents, that the basic root of all problems in the Middle East was U.S.
                    support of Israel. We were told that neither the seizure of the Canal or any
                    other tensions would have happened had it not been for our support of
                    Israel.</p>

                <p>CROSS: Normally we would say that the only way to reach peace in the Middle East
                    was to resolve Israel's status. Israel took a major portion of the West Bank and
                    Gaza after the 1967 war - many years after I worked in Alexandria. I think there
                    were some possibilities for reaching a settlement of the Israel-Arab conflict in
                    the 1950s, even after the Israelis had joined the British and the French in
                    their attack to recapture the Suez Canal. We tried to appear balanced in our
                    attitude toward the Middle East issues so that we could try to have a reasonable
                    dialogue with the Egyptians. They did make some comments which had a faint ring
                    of truth. For example, they would point out that it was the Germans who had
                    killed all the Jews; there had been Jews living in Egypt and other Arab
                    countries for centuries. So the question we would get was “Why are you taking
                    our land when we had no responsibility for the Holocaust? Why don't you take
                    part of Germany if the Jews need a homeland?”</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were your impressions of Nasser? What were
                        Alexandriansaying to you about him?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROSS: There were three separate societies in Alexandria. One was the
                    cosmopolitan crowd which had been very wealthy and lived an old-fashioned regal
                    existence. They were something to see. There were four books published by
                    Lawrence Durrell about this crowd while I was in Alexandria, The Alexandria
                    Quartet. The first was titled. Justine. She was the sort of character who played
                    around a bit. One would have thought that Alexandrians would have denied knowing
                    her at all - there couldn't have been any connection between them and her. But
                    we had a number of absolutely beautiful women come to us and whisper to us who
                    Justine really was or “Moi, je suis Justine.” This group really represented the
                    past and were disappearing. They lived very well. Most of them were trying to
                    protect their properties from Nasser by making deals and barely just holding on
                    to their past.</p>
                <p>There were some Sephardic Jews who had lived in Alexandria since the beginning of
                    the 16th Century. They were later joined by other Jews. That was the second
                    group.</p>
                <p>Then there was an Egyptian community. We became well acquainted with many of
                    them. They were mostly bankers, engineers - middle class with substance and
                    ability. They had not been particularly pro-Nasser but were interested in moving
                    Egypt ahead so that it could catch up with Europe and the First World. They
                    hoped that Nasser would be a better leader than their dissolute king. But they
                    were becoming disillusioned with Nasser. Dodi Fayed - of Princess Diana fame -
                    belonged to this group.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel any pressure from the Israeli lobby?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>CROSS: Not at all. Occasionally we would get a consular cable telling us that a
                    Senator “so and so” was inquiring about a visa for someone in Alexandria. That
                    was a problem because as a consular officer we might have a view on the
                    eligibility of the applicant, but the fact that there was Congressional interest
                    had considerable influence. These were primarily applicants who had had
                    difficulty in obtaining an Egyptian passport in the first place - often limited
                    to visits to certain countries and sometimes specifically excluding some
                    countries that the traveler could not visit. Among the latter group, sometimes
                    the UAR would be listed - particularly Jews - so that the traveler could not
                    return to Egypt. So I was faced with these problems and raised a fuss about it
                    because how could I issue a visa if I knew that the traveler could not return to
                    Egypt. These were people who were well-of- with secret bank accounts in
                    Switzerland and other countries - and had many contacts in the U.S. who could
                    support them if necessary. So they were obviously well qualified to have a
                    visitor's visa, but since they could not return to the UAR, it was hard to issue
                    such a visa. I finally rationalized that even if these Jews could not return to
                    Egypt, they would be welcomed in Israel and therefore would technically not need
                    to stay in the U.S. beyond the length of their visa. I tested this approach on
                    my Egyptian assistant, who knew everybody; she said that these people were not
                    interested in going to Israel. My view was that despite the applicant's
                    reservations, he or she was qualified to go to Israel and therefore would be
                    eligible for a visa to the U.S. So that is what I did and INS never rejected any
                    of the people to whom I issued a visa.</p>
                <p>Q: Nasser was trying to foment unrest in Lebanon. It has been alleged Egyptian
                    diplomats in Lebanon were posting propaganda and undertaking other
                    anti-government activities and that was one of the reasons why we invaded
                    Lebanon. Was there any reaction against the consulate general during this
                    period?</p>
                <p>CROSS: I think there were some threats of demonstrations. We had to be careful,
                    but I don't remember any anti-American activities. During this period, I had to
                    attend a speech by Nasser as the senior American - the consul general was out of
                    town. I had to listen to two or three hours of anti-U.S. haranguing; my Lebanese
                    colleague had to listen to some vitriolic comments about his country. We both
                    sat separately from the rest of the consular corps, and I began to feel somewhat
                    uneasy about having to walk to the office after this event, even though it was
                    only a five block walk. In another setting, I might well have walked out, but
                    there were 100,000 Egyptians in the audience. They had been listening to this
                    diatribe for a long time, and I wasn't quite sure what the their reaction might
                    be. I was assured that all would be well and, in fact, as I was leaving the
                    area, walking between two lines of policemen, I heard a few of them shout, “How
                    are you, American consul? Are you enjoying Alexandria?” These comments were
                    accompanied by some friendly pats on the back - even though I had just been
                    lambasted as a representative of an “imperial power.”Q: By 1959, what were your
                    hopes for the next assignment?</p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>CROSS: I had liked Alexandria, but I didn't think I wanted to pursue a career in
                    the Arab world. Without any prompting from me, Eric Kocher, when my two years
                    were up, asked that I return to Washington to work in the South-East Asia
                    office.</p>
                <p>Washington</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What countries did that office cover?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROSS: That office had been created after FE [Far East Bureau] was broken up into
                    several sub-regions. So South-East Asian affairs covered Indochina, Thailand,
                    and Burma. We did not cover Singapore, Malaysia or Indonesia or the Philippines.
                    My first assignment was the Vietnam desk. I knew nothing about Vietnam. So when
                    I reported for duty, they changed my assignment to the Burma desk because the
                    officer there had Vietnam experience and we just switched. So for two years I
                    was the Burma desk officer, until very early in 1961.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was your immediate boss and who the assistant
                        secretary foEast Asian affairs?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROSS: When I first arrived, the assistant secretary was Jeff Parsons. Bill
                    Sullivan was his special assistant. The office director was Eric Kocher, whom I
                    mentioned earlier. He had two deputies: Dick Usher and Bob Cleveland. There
                    were, of course, personnel changes in the time I was in the bureau; for example,
                    Daniel Anderson became the office director about a year after I arrived.</p>
                <p>At the time, Laos was the key issue in the area. Everyone wainterested in what
                    was going on there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Including the president.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROSS: That is right. This was towards the end of the Eisenhower administration.
                    I was drawn into Laos affairs and spent a considerable amount of time fighting
                    AID over our assistance programs. Christian Chapman was the Laos desk officer
                    but he was swamped, so it was decided that I would help him out. I often had to
                    take messages around the Department for clearance - couldn't do it over the
                    phone in those days. I wasn't always met with open arms and had often to argue
                    Chris' case. As I said, AID was a problem as was NEA, which had jurisdiction
                    over India and therefore greatly interested in Laos; also the China desk had
                    great interest.</p>
                <p>When Kennedy became president, Chapman decided he had enough of Laotian affairs.
                    He was going to be married and didn't want to spend seven days each week at his
                    desk. So I was asked to take over the Laos desk. That is how I got started in
                    Indochina.</p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>Q: Let me go back to Burma for a second. What was the situation in that country
                    when you first reported for duty and how did you get up to speed?</p>
                <p>CROSS: That is an interesting question. I got up to speed through sheer luck. My
                    immediate boss, Dick Usher, had been in Burma; he was very sympathetic and a
                    very good guy - even if a workaholic. He spent many hours briefing me on Burma.
                    Bill Sullivan, my predecessor, was also available. He told me all the things
                    that needed to be done. But the greatest assistance I got came from a childhood
                    friend from my China days and my former college roommate, Lucian Pye. He had
                    just written a book on Burma in which he described the culture and how it
                    operated. So before I actually reported for duty, I spent a weekend with Lucian,
                    reading the manuscript of his book which was to be published shortly. So I
                    started on the desk quite knowledgeable about Burmese culture and habit. People
                    were astonished that I knew such details without having ever been in the country
                    or having had anything to do with it until then.The political situation was that
                    General Ne Win, having mounted a successful coup, was the president - which he
                    was for over 35 years. He had a reputation in Washington as an anti-communist.
                    That was true, but then he was anti everything. So we were to get along with Ne
                    Win, and as a show of our support, we were going to finance a new “road to
                    Mandalay.” He had decided that a new road was needed and then had come to us to
                    ask how much we could contribute to its costs. It was a substantial cost and AID
                    balked because it had other ideas for the use of these funds. Of course,
                    whatever we devoted to this road would have to be matched by the Burmese. They
                    didn't understand that; they thought that if we were going to finance the road,
                    they would not have to put a penny of their money into it. The construction
                    would have caused some political problems because certain properties would have
                    had to be expropriated and some businesses destroyed. That would have raised
                    problems for the government; it could not really blame us for causing problems
                    because they had asked for the road.</p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>In any case, they were not happy to be asked to do something, even though it was
                    for their road - “burden-sharing” was not a familiar concept to them. The
                    Burmese preferred to bargain mile by mile; they didn't want to be burdened with
                    responsibilities before the first shovel-load was even thrown, particularly if
                    these were demanded by foreigners. We had some very good people working on this
                    project, and I think the final product would have been a showcase. But we could
                    not convince the AID bureaucracy to make the necessary funds available, although
                    I must admit that I had sympathy for their viewpoint. It would have cost a lot
                    of money, and its main rationale was to make Ne Win feel better. I think even if
                    we had found the resources, Ne Win would not have been appreciative because with
                    our investment, as I said, came a lot of responsibilities that the Burmese would
                    have had to carry out. The more requirements that we levied on the Burmese, the
                    less Ne Win liked the project. The only way that we could have gained some
                    political points would have been to do it all ourselves; that of course was
                    contrary to our assistance program philosophy. On the other hand, the resources
                    could have been used quite effectively in providing technical assistance in such
                    areas as health and education and rice distribution. That in my view was far
                    preferable to our participation in the road construction project.</p>
                <p>Of course, had we agreed to finance the project, Walter P. McConaughy, as the new
                    ambassador, could have delivered the good news to Ne Win. But, as I said, AID
                    was much opposed to the idea. Finally, we reached a compromise and financed a
                    partial road which was built long after I had left the desk. This whole episode
                    was not very helpful to Burma-U.S. relations, but then nothing much would have
                    been.</p>
                <p>My biggest concern was that Ne Win was not a benevolent man. But he did put a
                    very good face on what he did and was quite accommodating to American visitors.
                    Ne Win visited the U.S. while I was on the desk. During this time, a member of
                    the Burmese delegation came to me and said that the prominent American doctor
                    who had been provided by the U.S. government had reported to them that CIA had
                    asked him to give CIA a medical report on Ne Win. Why CIA asked the doctor for
                    this information I didn't understand; there were many other more subtle ways of
                    getting the information. The doctor was very upset with this request and told Ne
                    Win who also became very upset. So the visit did not end well, even though Ne
                    Win had been well taken care of.</p>
                <p>I think that visit was my major contribution to U.S.-Burma relations. We were
                    taking a lot of little steps which were very good for that relationship. For
                    example, we had a very active USIS program which was very helpful.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>CROSS: It was about the same, except it was less vicious because shortly after Ne
                    Win's visit, the Burmese held an election which was won by U Nu. We were against
                    him for dumb reasons because he was not perceived as anti-communist as Ne Win.
                    After I left the desk, U Nu was pushed out, never to be effective again as a
                    Burmese leader, although he should have been a world figure in the so-called
                    “Non-Aligned Movement.”Q: Was there a communist insurgency in the country during
                    this period?</p>
                <p>CROSS: The communists were split into two factions: the reds and the whites. One
                    had more Chinese support than the other. I should note that in 1959, there were
                    still some Kuomintang troops in Burma - left over from the Chinese civil war.
                    They occupied northern Burma and had already become involved in the drug trade
                    which flowed from China through Burma to its ultimate destination. The NSC
                    issued an order to get the KMT troops out of Burma because with anti-communist
                    Ne Win in charge, we didn't want anything to upset his apple cart. The KMT, of
                    course, was not eager to leave, and although the CIA made a major effort to get
                    them out, it was not successful. It would have taken a much more concentrated
                    and continuing effort.</p>
                <p>In fact, there were KMT troops in many parts of Indochina keeping the Chinese
                    communists from infiltrating into Laos and Thailand and Burma. Some were good
                    soldiers; others were terrible. Some of the good ones were eventually evacuated
                    and brought to Taiwan. The others remained. Later, Taiwan actually inserted some
                    of its troops into the area who were very disciplined and participated in some
                    activities against the communists.</p>

                <p>In the north of Burma, we had two tribes: the Kachins and the Karens. They were
                    essentially trying to establish themselves in the country; they had been shunted
                    aside by the Burmese. These tribes were big and well-organized minorities. They
                    were interested in some kind of autonomy. The government had a lot of problems
                    with these two tribes. One of the difficulties we faced was that both tribes had
                    been on our side during WWII, whereas the Burmese had supported the Japanese. So
                    we owed these tribes some debt. Furthermore, the Karens were Christians and that
                    gave us an affinity.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did we believe that the Chinese communists were trying to
                        subverthe Burmese regime?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>CROSS: I suspect that we felt that the Chinese communists were trying to subvert
                    all governments in the area who were not devoutly communist. But we had no
                    indication that the Burmese government was in any way playing ball with them. It
                    would have been quite inconsistent with Ne Win's views. The end of the 1950s and
                    the 1960s were the heydays of the Non-Aligned Movement, though Ne Win, in his
                    own words, was “not aligned with the non-aligned.” So I don't think that the
                    Chinese communists were much of a factor in Burma in this period, although I am
                    sure that the regime watched the Chinese population in Burma very closely.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about India? Was it a factor in our relationship with
                        Burma?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROSS: I think it became more of a factor when U Nu took over as president. He
                    had a certain affinity with the Indians because both Nehru and U Nu felt that
                    they were leaders of the “non-aligned” movement, although U Nu did not have the
                    sharp tone that Nehru displayed and indeed was less active in the movement. But
                    I think in all situations, the Burmese were comfortable with the U.S.; they were
                    friendly with Americans who reciprocated their attachment. The Burmese are very
                    likeable, but I don't think that personal relationships had much influence on
                    governmental policies; Ne Win was going to do whatever he wanted regardless of
                    any outside advice.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CROSS: We had a lot of contacts with it. It wasn't an organization which
                    initiated very much. They needed our support. For example, if they wanted to
                    entertain, we would have to supply it with names of Americans who might be
                    invited. They never would start a conversation about business. That was not part
                    of their culture. We would have to raise the issue and then they might
                    respond.</p>
                <p>Laos Conference - 1961-1962</p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>In retrospect, I was lucky to be chosen for the Burma desk and then becoming the
                    Laos Desk officer because that led to working with Averill Harriman. Early in
                    1961, a power struggle ensued with Kenneth Young, a former head of the South
                    Asian Affairs office, who wanted to be ambassador to Vietnam, but that ran into
                    problems. So he was then considered for Thailand. But before his name could be
                    sent to the Senate, he had heard about a 14 nation conference on Laos that was
                    being planned. The Office of South-East Asian affairs was asked to develop some
                    position papers for this conference. I was asked to join a group consisting of
                    Pat Byrne, Skip Purnell and others to meet - secretly, I might add - to draft
                    some of these position papers. None of us felt very strongly about the issues in
                    any case and I am not sure that the Department did either. We had just one
                    meeting with Harriman, then an ambassador-at-large, before he left for Geneva.
                    We went along on the same plane in May 1961 with people like Joe Sisco and Abe
                    Chayes, the legal advisor. They all had their own ideas on the U.S. positions.
                    Paul Nitze, representing DOD, was also on board with ideas of his own. We all
                    met with Secretary of State Dean Rusk in some lousy office near our hotel in
                    Geneva.</p>
                <p>The first week was utter chaos. Meetings were called and then canceled; press
                    conferences were convened without anyone having a clear idea where we were
                    going. Harriman sat out in a hallway. Then they all went off to Vienna to meet
                    Khrushchev. Finally, we could actually participate in the conference. But even
                    then, we were confused because John Steeves, Harriman's deputy, was not in
                    accord with his boss' views, which were basically to find some way to reach
                    agreement at this conference. The basic concept sort of fell into Harriman's lap
                    when he was visiting Cambodia and met with Prince Sihanouk. It was a pretty
                    concept, but Steeves did not think that the conference should come to an
                    agreement beyond agreeing that the North Vietnamese should not be allowed to
                    occupy Laos.</p>
                <p>So Steeves and Harriman did not get along. I remember that one time, we were
                    meeting with the French foreign minister. The conversation was
                    non-controversial, when Steeves all of a sudden asked in front of everyone why
                    were we holding this conversation. Harriman turned to him and said: “Because I
                    want to!” Soon after that, Steeves and all officers above Class 3, were sent
                    home and Bill Sullivan was sent to Geneva to organize the U.S. delegation, which
                    then consisted only of young officers . The theory was that a group like that
                    would work better because it would follow Harriman's views without challenging
                    them. Early in the U.S. delegation's meetings, Harriman had stated that he did
                    not believe that the president would ever put U.S. ground troops into Laos. He
                    thought that although we were junior officers, we would understand the
                    president's position. We therefore had to get an agreement which did not call
                    for U.S. military intervention on the ground in Laos. Using CIA or other means
                    were acceptable, but no American ground forces.</p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>After my return to Washington, I handled the Washington end of the Geneva
                    conference. Harriman returned twice during the fall to talk to senior officials
                    and the president. I think it was quite clear that neither Walter McConaughy,
                    the assistant secretary for East Asia or Alexis Johnson, the deputy
                    undersecretary, were on the same wave length with Harriman. So he had no support
                    from senior officials and much of the work fell on me.</p>
                <p>I often rode in Harriman's car, an old Checker's cab, which he claimed could be
                    driven for more than 400,000 miles. I used to go to the White House to pick
                    Harriman up to take him to the airport. On one occasion, as we were driving over
                    Memorial Bridge, Harriman said to me, “The President (Kennedy) will not put
                    ground troops into Laos.” I asked him whether that was a direct quote. He
                    said:”I have been in Washington long enough to know that he means it when he
                    says it! But I don't want the president's position to be known by anyone except
                    Alex and Walter.” So I dictated a message to Johnson and McConaughy. I then took
                    to it the sixth floor and left it on the secretary's desk. I didn't hear anymore
                    about it.</p>
                <p>A few days later, Dan Anderson, who was my boss, came to see me. He showed me my
                    memorandum with comments from McConaughy and Alex Johnson saying that they
                    didn't think that I should be passing around information like that. Dan took the
                    memo and put into the “burn” bag. I knew that I had quoted Harriman accurately
                    and I was confident that Harriman had very clear instructions from President
                    Kennedy to bring the conference to a successful conclusion. Nevertheless, there
                    were continual battles over each and every word of what was to be the final
                    agreement. Harriman's view was that if the U.S. position could not have been
                    supported with a particular phrase, it would have to be included in some other
                    way. There was no way, in his mind, that the conference would not succeed. The
                    only thing that might have ended the conference would have been a resumption of
                    war in Laos; as long as the cease-fire held, so would the conference. Harriman
                    thought that if the conference seemed to be floundering, the cease-fire would
                    break down. He also had some plans to enter into some joint efforts with the
                    Soviets. My guess is that the tensions between Harriman and McConaughy were over
                    Harriman's determination to get an agreement. McConaughy was transferred to
                    Pakistan after only a short tour as assistant secretary, to be succeeded by
                    Harriman.</p>
                <p>So the struggle over what the desk officer was to do changed again. What Harriman
                    had wanted when he was in Geneva was someone in Washington to watch out for his
                    interests, which I tried to do. Now that he was an assistant secretary, his
                    requirements changed. The Laos agreement was signed in 1962, which, on the
                    surface, conceivably might have done something about the situation in South-East
                    Asia. We managed to incorporate into the agreement a key provision which would
                    have barred any party which had signed the accord to use Laos as a base for
                    subversive or other activities in another country in the region. That was called
                    the “corridor” provision because it barred the North Vietnamese from using Laos
                    as a passageway for their efforts to conquer South Vietnam. But the North
                    Vietnamese never lived up to that provision; in fact, they never withdrew their
                    forces from Laos as required by the agreement.</p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>I believe that the North Vietnamese unwillingness to abide by the agreements that
                    they had signed had an effect on Kennedy. He might well have hoped that a
                    14-nation accord, which stipulated that Laos would become and remain neutral in
                    the South-East Asia conflicts, might have led eventually to a similar solution
                    for the whole region, barring all the major countries from involvement in the
                    affairs of that area. The fact that the North Vietnamese refused to abide by the
                    terms of a agreement must have been a great disappointment, despite the fact
                    that all the experts had predicted that Hanoi would not live up to it. Harriman
                    was heavily criticized for convincing the president to sign off on an accord
                    which was not likely to be implemented by one of the signatories.</p>
                <p>I spent a lot of time on this agreement. Once it was signed in the summer of
                    1962, I spent a lot of time on seeing to it that the North Vietnamese would meet
                    some resistance in the South in their efforts to subvert the agreement. This
                    included such actions as having CIA arm the Meo (also called Hmong) tribesmen to
                    fight the communists.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was providing the information that the North
                        Vietnamese troopwere moving south?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROSS: We already had in place some elements of an intelligence collection
                    effort. We said that we would withdraw all of our presence from Laos within 90
                    days after the signing of the accord; in the meantime we continued our
                    activities there which were far more expansive than we ever admitted. In any
                    case, we knew from observers on the ground that the Pathet Lao had run over a
                    certain village and then had withdrawn. So communist activities were hardly
                    covert.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who were the principal guarantors of the accord?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROSS: The conference was made up by the two co-chairmen of the 1954 agreement -
                    the Soviet Union and the UK. The 1954 agreement had given these two an oversight
                    responsibility which we interpreted to mean that the British would work with us.
                    and the Soviets, with the Chinese and North Vietnamese. Then there was an
                    international control commission consisting of three countries - Canada, India,
                    and Poland. The composition of the commission was based on Khrushchev's concept
                    of a nation from each side - east and west - and a neutral party. He called it a
                    “Troika” or a Russian three-horse sleigh. The function of the ICC would have
                    been to report on violations of the agreement. If the Indians had indeed played
                    their role well, we might have been able to have a manageable situation; the
                    agreement did not specify that the commission's reports had to be unanimous;
                    majority-rule was acceptable. That allowed the issuance of reports, but when it
                    came to recommendations and implementation of findings, then the commission
                    would have to be unanimous and that, of course, was not feasible. So the
                    commission start with high hopes was soon dashed by reality.</p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>Then there were the countries neighboring Laos: Burma, Thailand, Cambodia and
                    North and South Vietnam. They also had a deep interest in what would be
                    happening - or not happening - in Laos. Laos itself was divided into three
                    factions - left, right, and center. The left was purely ideological, unlike the
                    right or the center led by Prince Souvanna Phouma. It was agreed that the Prince
                    would head up the coalition government.</p>
                <p>Q: As has happened so often before after accords are signed, the principals
                    withdraw from the issue, leaving the mess for the desk officer. That is not a
                    very comfortable position.</p>
                <p>CROSS: The fact that the accords were not working was soon communicated to us by
                    the CIA. So we began to work intensively with the Canadians. They agreed that
                    the arrangements were not working and said that they had been putting pressure
                    on the Indians for the International Control Commission to take some remedial
                    action. We asked our ambassador in New Delhi, John Galbraith, to talk to Foreign
                    Minister Krishna Menon, but the latter was basically anti-American and therefore
                    not helpful. The Soviet Union on the surface wanted to be seen as helpful but
                    was in fact engaged in giving aid to the communist Pathet Lao - mainly by
                    providing air transportation. So the whole agreement sort of petered out by
                    1962. Meanwhile, we were very active in South Vietnam with our “strategic
                    hamlet” program headed by Lansdale and Bobby Thompson of the UK. With all the
                    unrest there, our government's attention moved from Laos to Vietnam. Harriman
                    left Laos matters, and I left the desk in the summer of 1963 to go to the
                    National War College.</p>
                <p>Q: We must have reached the point somewhere along the line when we must have said
                    that “there is no use us playing by the rules; no one else is.”</p>
                <p>CROSS: What we said was that since the other side was violating the agreement, we
                    did not feel bound by it. We never said that we would break the agreement; we
                    were only going to counter what the other side was doing. That is in fact what
                    the Laotian tribes funded by the CIA were doing; they were just resisting the
                    North Vietnamese. The communists built the Ho Chi Minh Trail, which mostly ran
                    through Laos. They were essentially opposed only by the Hmong, not the lowland
                    Lao. In the summer of 1962 after the Geneva accords were signed, I had visited
                    the area. They took me to a place where I saw a whole North Vietnamese battalion
                    settling in in a highly organized fashion - straw/bamboo huts lined up in neat
                    rows, fences, sentries - the whole bit.</p>
                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>Several years later, I asked whether those North Vietnamese troops had ever left
                    in accordance with the agreements they had made. We bombed them, but I am not
                    sure that they weren't in Lao territory until long after our withdrawal from
                    South Vietnam. But back in 1962, we had some hopes that the agreements would
                    stick and that some semblance of stability might return to the area. There was a
                    lot of good work done to support Laos economically; in fact, Laos developed
                    considerably in the post-1962 era. When Bill Sullivan was the ambassador in the
                    mid-1960s, I think we managed to hold the Pathet Lao off, keeping them in the
                    jungles. The North Vietnamese did not make a major push into Laos, with the
                    exception of the Ho Chi Minh Trail. They were concentrating on South
                    Vietnam.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have many contacts with the desk responsible for
                        SoutVietnam?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROSS: We were all in the same office. They supported a more robust stance. They
                    felt Diem was not strong enough. The Thai desk headed by Ed Masters was also in
                    favor of stronger stance.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you resolve these questions at your level?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROSS: We resolved it in I guess the simplest way; Harriman just told them what
                    he wanted to do without asking for their blessings. These were good officers but
                    saw the world in different hues than we or the Laos Desk did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were the Thai and South Vietnamese desks fighting a
                        rear-guaraction?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROSS: Yes. They didn't really have a chance to test their ardor. But I don't
                    want to overstate what were really shadings of U.S. policy. Harriman was not
                    opposed to doing anything for Thailand, but he was focused on getting the
                    agreement on Laos and everything else came second.</p>
                <p>Q: What was your impression of Harriman?</p>
                <p>CROSS: I liked the governor. In many ways he operated quite differently from
                    other senior officials. I think his outstanding characteristic was his ability
                    to gather all the facts and details and assess them, depend on his staff, and
                    then ram things through by sheer will. He was totally loyal to the president and
                    whatever Kennedy wanted, Harriman would do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of Souvanna Phouma and his
                        government?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>CROSS: I think that Souvanna was a very skilled Lao. He did not come across as a
                    very hard charging leader. He was an aristocrat; he was married to a French
                    woman. He was very urbane and I suppose suave by his lights. He was respected by
                    most of his countrymen. The right wing was not antagonistic to him as long as
                    American aid flowed to them, too. He was really the only person who could have
                    brought the various Lao factions together.</p>
                <p>The National War College - 1963-1964</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In 1963, you were assigned to the National War College.
                        How wathat?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROSS: That was a great break. It had been a long three years. Except for my two
                    week annual vacation, I was in the office every day, except for one day and one
                    Memorial Day.</p>
                <p>So the War College was a welcome change of pace. My only criticism of the
                    curriculum was that it did not include enough military subjects. We FSOs were
                    advanced beyond the military students in world affairs, so we had to listen to a
                    lot of repetition of what we already knew. I think the curriculum has been
                    beefed up considerably since I attended.</p>
                <p>I did not see ourselves as a resource for the professors. There were State
                    officers assigned to teach classes; we students should have been that and only
                    that. We were regarded as people who didn't know very much about certain
                    subjects in which our military colleagues were far more expert and, on the other
                    hand, we were also students who knew more about other subjects. So there was a
                    useful combination of backgrounds and talents which I think worked quite well
                    when we broke down into working groups. We got to know each other very well in
                    those groups. We did of course become well aware of the military's attitude
                    toward certain issues. Since I had been in the military myself, I was not
                    surprised by the positions that my military classmates took.</p>
                <p>We did have a thorough briefing on nuclear issues, but as I said, there might
                    well have been more military issues discussed. On nuclear weapons, we had a
                    highly classified briefing and became acquainted with how an explosive device
                    and the whole system really worked.</p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>The most interesting revelation I had during that year came during the annual
                    trip that the class took overseas. I chose Europe because I felt that I would
                    never be assigned there. We were one of the few classes that went to Moscow.
                    There we were invited to attend a “war game” led by a senior Soviet tank
                    commander. It was about this time that there was a lot of discussion about the
                    use in tactical nuclear weapons in Europe. The “war game”' scenario, as written
                    by the Soviets, was intended to prove that after one tactical nuclear weapon was
                    fired, we would all immediately find ourselves in a complete nuclear exchange.
                    We all took notes of the Soviets' conclusions and I am sure that my military
                    colleagues reported that Soviet doctrine to the Pentagon after our return. Our
                    doctrine of course was quite different and stemmed from our analysis that the
                    Soviets had a military advantage in conventional forces which could only be
                    off-set by these tactical nuclear weapons. Any ground attack would be met with
                    tactical nuclear weapon and that was to bring the fighting to an end.</p>
                <p>Cyprus</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you went to Cyprus as DCM and served there from
                        1964-66.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROSS: I was the last person to receive his assignment in that War College class.
                    I was supposed to go to Singapore to be the consul general, replacing Sam
                    Gilstrap who was to go to some African post as ambassador. He was an
                    administrative officer who was from Texas and a buddy of Lyndon Johnson. On the
                    next to last day of the course, I was told that FE could not hold on to me any
                    longer, waiting for the Gilstrap assignment to go through. Therefore they had
                    released my name for assignment to NEA. I was told that I would go to Cyprus as
                    the DCM. I found that intriguing because this was the time when Cyprus was
                    attracting considerable attention. The UN was just beginning to mount up its
                    mediation efforts between the Turks and the Greeks. Greek Cypriot terrorists had
                    placed a bomb in our chancery and partly destroyed it (No one was killed, but
                    the embassy had many security scares while we were in Cyprus. A few years later,
                    our ambassador was killed by sniper fire.)</p>
                <p>Toby Belcher, who was our new ambassador, was anxious for some leave. He was an
                    expert on Greek affairs and had been the consul general before the post was
                    upgraded to an embassy. As a newly arrived ambassador, he wanted his own choice
                    as his DCM. So I was delighted to go to Cyprus for two years. They were very
                    exciting years for a DCM.</p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>I should mention that the day after I graduated from the War College, I went to
                    the office responsible for Greek, Turkish and Iran affairs in the Department.
                    That office was headed by Kay Bracken, who had served in both Iran and Greece.
                    When I went to see her, I was told that she didn't have time to talk to me nor
                    to give me any work. She suggested that I go to the Operations Center which
                    apparently had a vacancy, and while I was working there I could read all of the
                    telegraphic traffic which mentioned Cyprus. So I did that only to find that
                    there was no one in the Operations Center. There wasn't anyone who was reading
                    the cables about Cyprus. So I sat down and started to read the files when along
                    came someone from the Secretariat. He had a messenger with him; he asked me to
                    read a draft cable, put in appropriate paragraphing, check the spelling, but not
                    to change the message in any way. I started; it was exciting since I had been in
                    the Ops Center just a few minutes and in an area strange to me and here I was
                    working on obviously a very important message. It was a message from President
                    Johnson to President Inonu of Turkey. It turned out to be a very important
                    message for U.S.-Turkish relations. It was in my eyes a very crude message; it
                    was just phrased wrong. It asked how the Turks could expect the U.S. to protect
                    them when they took unilateral actions. I thought that this was not the way I
                    would approach the Turks. But I didn't change anything and gave the cable to the
                    messenger. Soon after that, Kay came to see me and asked how things were going.
                    So I told her about the message, which surprised her since she had never heard
                    of it. I had not even finished my sentence when she flew out the door, very
                    distressed. It was obvious she had been left out of the loop. The draft had come
                    from Rusk's office which was trying to prevent an intra-NATO war. This was after
                    George Ball, the undersecretary, had visited Athens, Ankara, and Nicosia without
                    success.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation in Cyprus when you arrived in
                        1964?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROSS: The UN peace-keeping force (United Nations Peacekeeping Forces in Cyprus -
                    UNPKC) was just getting started. The commanding general was an Indian, General
                    Thimayya, a wonderful guy. The British brigade, which had been stationed in
                    Cyprus for many years, was assigned to the UN command. Then the command also had
                    regular battalions from Canada and Ireland and forces from such countries as
                    Sweden and Denmark, seasoned “peacekeepers,” plus a medical team from
                    Austria.</p>
                <p>But this command was just getting organized when I arrived. Its main goal was to
                    stop incidents between Greeks and Turks before they could spread. For example,
                    there were allegations that some Greeks were mistreating Turkish farmers. So the
                    UN command set up a check-point to end that harassment, and with the visible
                    presence of the UN forces, the violence did end. The command submitted regular
                    reports to UN headquarters in NY that were published and distributed around the
                    world. There is no question that the UN presence reduced the number of
                    incidents, but it never was able to eliminate them entirely.</p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>About two or three weeks after my arrival, the Turkish air force bombed the
                    island. That obviously raised tensions between the two communities.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the embassy staff relatively small?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROSS: Yes. We had a political officer - Robert Sharp. Barry King was there.
                    George McFarland, a Turkish language officer, was assigned to the embassy. You
                    have to remember that we in fact had a dual workload. Whatever we did with the
                    Greeks, we had to do with the Turks and vice-versa. We could not afford to be
                    seen as giving one side greater weight than the other. On my first day in
                    Cyprus, I was taken to dinner in Greek territory. I heard all about their
                    positions. Then after dinner, I went to the Turkish side to have a brandy with
                    Turkish leaders who told me their positions. As far as I can remember, when I
                    left two years later, both sides still had the same positions they aired that
                    first night.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Archbishop Makarios was the president of Cyprus at the
                        time. Whawas your impression of him?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROSS: I had no background on Greek, Turkish or Cypriot affairs. I found him a
                    remarkable person. He had a noticeable steeliness and stubbornness to him -
                    which was not a rare phenomenon among the Cypriot Greeks. There was no question
                    that Makarios' main - and perhaps sole - goal was to achieve independence for
                    Cyprus. He was not interested in annexing the island to Greece. In the early
                    years of Cyprus - somewhere around the 6th Century - a princess from Christian
                    Turkey came to the island and was healed from some malady that she had. From
                    then on, the archbishop of Cyprus became an independent power, an Autocephalous
                    Church. For example, he was allowed to wear a blue robe rather than a black one
                    as did other members of the Greek Orthodox Church and use a special
                    purplish-colored ink to sign documents.</p>
                <p>So for centuries, the church on Cyprus was an independent entity and no
                    archbishop would have considered really turning the island over to either the
                    Greeks or the Turks. So Makarios just followed the lead of his predecessors. The
                    Greeks, in the person of Colonel Grivas, were still a major force on the island;
                    later this group tried to mount a coup against Makarios. I met Grivas several
                    times; I found him to be a “barbershop” kind of hood - that is, talkative,
                    boastful. His actions set Cyprus back a good many years and gave the Turks a
                    very good reason to invade the island in 1974.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Denktash the Turkish leader at this time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>CROSS: The same people were leaders then as they are today (except for Makarios.)
                    We used to have dinner with Clerides quite often. Glafkos Clerides at the time
                    was a policy advisor; the foreign minister was Kyprianou. At the time he was
                    very young - about 30 years old. We got along with the government pretty well -
                    they thought we were on their side. Toby spoke excellent Greek and I think did
                    in fact sympathize with the Greek Cypriots because he was concerned that the
                    Turks would invade and occupy the whole island.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was our view at the time of the treatment that the
                        Turks werreceiving?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROSS: They were essentially badly treated. The Greeks kept them down, despite
                    the warnings from Turkey that such treatment would call for a response. The
                    Greeks operated in gangs, driving the Turks out of their native villages. It was
                    very cruel. The UN tried to put a stop to this barbarism, and I must say that
                    during my time, there weren't many incidents.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the Turkish Cypriots take any action?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROSS: They were arming themselves and eventually were able to defend themselves
                    against the Greek gangs. According to the 1961 agreements that made Cyprus an
                    independent country, a battalion of the Turkish army and a battalion of the
                    Greek army could remain on the island. In fact, they were stationed relatively
                    close to each other near Nicosia. When matters seemed to get out of hand, the UN
                    advised the Greek army that further escalation might force the Turkish battalion
                    to take action. That stimulated the commander of the Greek battalion to call the
                    Greek Cypriot leaders to encourage them to calm things down. That helped quiet
                    the waters.</p>
                <p>Q: I think that in the 1960s we saw the growth of the Greek-American lobby which
                    painted an unbalanced picture of Cyprus. The Turkish story was really not told
                    in the U.S.</p>
                <p>CROSS: I think that is right. I think the Department was under considerable
                    political pressure from the Greek-American lobby to support Greek Cypriot
                    claims. I should mention again that during my tour, there was in Cyprus a
                    representative UN secretary general. This official kept looking for a solution;
                    first it was Galo Plaza, the former president of Ecuador. He was very skillful,
                    but he was not able to get the sides together. He was replaced by Carlos
                    Fernandez, a prominent Brazilian diplomat. Fernandez ran into the same problems
                    as his predecessor.</p>
                <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                <p>We worked with these UN representatives most of the time. They would talk to us
                    and the British about their efforts and possible solutions. The dialogue was
                    almost always the same because there weren't any solutions acceptable to both
                    sides. Furthermore, these Latin American diplomats were limited in what they
                    could propose. They had to be careful not to push either side to the edge
                    because then failure was certain and mediation would have to cease.A few months
                    before I left, Ambassador Toby Belcher and I began to see that the whole
                    situation was ridiculous. Our embassy in Athens was supporting the Greek
                    Cypriots, and our embassy in Ankara was supporting the Turkish Cypriot cause.
                    They were just showing “clientitis.” Only we in Nicosia had any ideas on how the
                    issues might be resolved. I was certain that if there were no interference from
                    either the Greek or the Turkish governments, a solution could be found by the
                    parties living in Cyprus. So I suggested that the embassy in Nicosia develop
                    some general outlines of a solution based on our knowledge of what would work in
                    Cyprus. We would then approach the Greek and Turkish governments with our plan.
                    We would put it to these governments that we were sick and tired of the
                    stalemate and that this plan would be our last effort. If they accepted the
                    plan, we would pursue it on Cyprus with the Greek and Turkish leaders there; if
                    they didn't accept it, we would announce we had lost interest in Cyprus and
                    would be unresponsive in the future to the pleas of either government. We would
                    declare that the Cyprus crisis had nothing to do with NATO and that we would
                    have no further interest in the matter.</p>
                <p>We sent this proposal to Washington where it was met with considerable fear. But
                    the Department did agree that the idea could be floated in Athens and Ankara
                    without it being designated as an official U.S. proposal. I went to our embassy
                    in Athens which agreed to most of our suggestions. I then went to Ankara where
                    Ray Hare was the ambassador with Ed Martin as DCM.</p>
                <p>Hare said simply that one doesn't present the Turks with ultimatums. In any case,
                    they didn't buy our proposal. Soon after that “shuttle” diplomacy, I left Cyprus
                    and was never again engaged in this issue. I went to London on a direct
                    transfer, but went through Washington for consultations and saw Ray Hare, who at
                    that time had become the assistant secretary for NEA. He told me that he thought
                    the plan had lots of merit, but that if we were to approach the Turks on a
                    take-it-or-leave-it basis, it wouldn't work.</p>
                <p>I should explain that the plan called for the same Turkish political status that
                    was in the Cypriot constitution. But the issue was that the Greeks were seeking
                    a unitary state under one president, not a confederation that the Turks sought.
                    We tried various formulas which would satisfy both positions, and I think we
                    finally found one that we thought might have met the political needs of each
                    side.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was it to deal with the Cypriot Turks?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                <p>CROSS: Toby dealt with Denktash. It was easy to deal with them because the
                    leadership was well educated and even the shepherds spoke English. So language
                    was not a problem, but they did have their share of “hotheads” who pushed the
                    leaders. I think it is fair to say that neither the Greek not Turkish leaders
                    could have remained in power - or even perhaps alive - if they had not heeded
                    the pressures from the “hot heads.” I must say that since my service in Cyprus,
                    I smile whenever I read about the periodic surges of optimism that the community
                    problems on Cyprus were about to be resolved through the appointment of a new
                    negotiator who would bring the two sides to Geneva and settle the whole thing -
                    probably by sitting in some good restaurant where he would say the same things
                    that had been said ad nauseam many times before.</p>
                <p>Q: I went to a meeting in Washington a couple of years ago, mourning 25 years of
                    tyranny on Cyprus - obviously sponsored by the Greek-American lobby. This
                    tyranny allegedly started with the Turkish invasion of 1974 - which was a
                    response to a Greek coup. All the speakers attributed the Cyprus “problem” to
                    this invasion. There was never any reference to the Greek atrocities perpetrated
                    on the Turks. I think one could not have left that conference without having a
                    feeling that the Cyprus problem stems from irrationality - on both sides.</p>
                <p>CROSS: Of course, it doesn't help that the Greeks and the Turks have been enemies
                    for centuries. It seems to me that there is really no possible negotiated
                    solution to the Cyprus problem. I think the world might be able to impose a
                    settlement if enough pressure were brought to bear on both countries. At the
                    moment, the Turks have the better of the situation because they occupy a much
                    larger portion of the island than their population would seem to merit.</p>
                <p>Q: From 1970-74, I was consul general in Athens. I liked the individual Greeks,
                    but I found their political behavior very hard to take. They blamed us for
                    everything, and they kept poking sticks at the Turkish tiger who could eat them
                    up without lifting his paws. The Greeks never seemed to quite grasp the reality
                    of the situation.</p>
                <p>CROSS: I agree. The Turks put the Greeks on notice many times that unless they
                    stopped harassing the Turkish Cypriots, they would bomb the island. And finally,
                    when the Greeks did not change behavior, they did bomb. The world was shocked,
                    even though it had heard the warnings.</p>
                <p>Q: The oral history collection has many stories about the vicissitudes of trying
                    to deal with the Cyprus problem. In today's terms, it is somewhat akin to
                    dealing with the Yugoslavia. The history of these conflicts goes back centuries.
                    We still have in the Department an ambassador named to deal with the Cyprus
                    matter. Talking about sinecures!</p>
                <p>CROSS: Holbrooke had the job for a while. I felt like writing to him to tell him
                    that the best way to handle the Cyprus problem is to tell the warring parties
                    that the U.S. had the solution and not to accept any arguments.</p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>London</p>
                <p>Q: You may be right, but I would guess it is a non-starter. But to go on. In
                    1966, you were transferred to London. Did you think that by this time you had
                    been tagged as a Near East hand?</p>
                <p>CROSS: I felt that I knew the Cyprus situation, but that was only a small corner
                    of the Near East. In London, I was assigned to handle Asian matters as part of
                    the embassy's political section. I think that assignment was the doing of Bill
                    Bundy, the assistant secretary for FE. It was a great job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At the time, did we have an Asian, an African and a Middle
                        Easexpert in the London embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROSS: We did then; I don't think that is true any longer. The political section
                    was headed by Bill Brubeck and had Tom Byrne in as the labor attache, Bill
                    Galloway as one of the political officers and so on. Bill was in London for many
                    years; he was already a veteran when I arrived and stayed long after my
                    departure. He had a stroke while we were in London, and I am glad to say that he
                    recovered. I should note that I was in London for only 10 months and left in
                    1967. My family, however, stayed for over two years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROSS: David Bruce. The DCM was Phil Kaiser. My job was to maintain contacts with
                    the British Foreign Office on a variety of issues of mutual interest in the
                    Asian area. We did tend to concentrate on China and Vietnam. But I was sent to
                    London primarily to take part in some secret negotiations we had with the
                    British and the Soviets concerning Vietnam.</p>
                <p>I need to go back to the beginning of the negotiations. I mentioned earlier that
                    the co-chairmen of the Indochina negotiations were the UK and the Soviet Union.
                    This dual chairmanship allowed us to pass information and views to the British
                    who could then pass them along to the Soviets. The Soviets, as co-chairmen,
                    could then pass the information to the Vietnamese. It was a very long round
                    about way; we did sometimes cut out the Soviets, but that was rather infrequent.
                    My job was not too stimulating because all I did was set up meetings and report
                    back to Washington on them and on any other information on Vietnam that I picked
                    up. The job did not call for much initiative.</p>
                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>My biggest challenge was public relations. In my first week in London, I called
                    on David Bruce at his residence. He preferred that to meetings in the office. He
                    was a wonderful guy - a first class diplomat. He told me that he personally felt
                    that Vietnam was distracting our attention from Europe and that therefore we
                    should probably disengage from there. While saying this, he had in front of him
                    instructions to encourage political support for South Vietnam in Great Britain.
                    So he told me to get together with USIS and do something. I worked with the PAO
                    and the deputy PAO; they weren't very enthusiastic and neither was the rest of
                    the political section. So the job landed in my lap.</p>
                <p>As part of this PR [public relations] effort, we were to support Harold Wilson's
                    Labor Party which was defending itself not from the Tories, but from its own
                    back-benchers who were demanding a much more vigorous anti-Vietnam policy,
                    reflecting some strong feelings in Great Britain, particularly from students. So
                    I was involved to a considerable extent in preparing the answers that the prime
                    minister was to use in Parliament during his weekly question-and-answer
                    sessions. George Brown, who was the foreign minister, was not very adept in
                    answering Parliamentary queries - they took place in the afternoon and that was
                    a little too late for him - after a few nips. So the prime minister had to field
                    the questions. We knew some of the questions that would arise; I would transmit
                    them to Washington, even though we knew that the British embassy in Washington
                    was already raising the same questions with the Department. I sent the same
                    message to Saigon so that our embassy there could join in drafting a reply for
                    the prime minister. My main concern was that London would say one thing,
                    Washington something else and Saigon something different from the other two. We
                    had to be on the same wave-length.</p>
                <p>I would attend the Parliamentary session to listen to what the British prime
                    minister did with our information. I think it worked very well and as far as I
                    can remember, there were no PR problems from the prime minister's answers.</p>
                <pb facs="0060" n="Page0060"/>
                <p>My other principal task - and the one that took most of my time - was to speak
                    about Vietnam around Great Britain. I have described this in some length in the
                    book I have written [Chapter 12 - Born a Foreigner). Most of my audiences were
                    hostile. In my 10 months in London, I think I spoke to about 20 audiences. One
                    of these appearances was before the Lady Conservatives of Godalming - a region
                    near London. The other was to the Army/Navy Club in London. That speech was
                    given after dinner, which meant that half of the audience was already asleep.
                    These were my only pro-American - or at least pro-American policy - audiences.
                    All the rest were British students or trade unions. I would have to go to “red
                    brick” universities in Birmingham, or Leeds or Manchester - industrial towns. I
                    was usually met by the secretary of the Socialist club, who was also the head of
                    the anti-Vietnam war committee. He hosted me to a lousy meal at the university
                    cafeteria which was followed by a two-hour meeting in a format which was always
                    the same, university after university. I would speak for 15 minutes after which
                    a student representative would speak; that was followed by a question and answer
                    period. The questions were mostly orations - anti-American. Some of them were
                    undergraduate cagey - like “How many children did you kill yesterday?”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the purpose of the exercise? Did anyone think you
                        coulchange those audiences' minds?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROSS: We thought it was important for our view of the war to be put in the
                    public eye. What we had to do was to keep our tempers in check, mix some humor
                    with our remarks, never maintain that we were “good” because the British
                    regarded assistance to others as a private matter - not to boast of it publicly.
                    There was considerable give-and-take in these sessions, and I think I actually
                    succeeded in bringing some understanding of the U.S. role to some of the kids'
                    minds.</p>
                <p>I tell a story in my book which typifies my experiences. One day, I went to
                    Brighton, to the University of Sussex. For some reason, the anti-Vietnam war
                    movement was particularly strong there. I arrived from London on a train and was
                    picked out as an American - although I carried an umbrella and a briefcase and
                    thought I looked like part of any British crowd. But one student picked me out
                    from all the other passengers who disembarked from the train that evening. I met
                    a nice Quaker lady who was going to be the moderator of the evening's
                    discussion. As I was leaving the station, I saw signs saying “Stop the war in
                    Vietnam” and advertising the evening's meeting. I told the Quaker lady that I
                    would not get into a debate about the war. Those were our instructions because
                    to do so would have been an interference in the internal British political
                    process. Furthermore, the other two participants in the panel were John
                    Mendelsohn, who was on the far left fringes of the Labour Party and another who
                    was said to be the only communist member of the House of Lords.</p>
                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>The meeting hall was packed. People were standing all over the place, with some
                    standing on the platform already making speeches. The aisles had to be cleared
                    so that we could reach the platform. I had learned a technique from previous
                    appearances; I searched the audience with my eyes to see whether there might be
                    anybody who at least would be willing to listen to my presentation. I was asked
                    to speak first; the Quaker lady did not say that I couldn't debate; she just
                    introduced me and thanked me for coming. So I started my speech which usually
                    included quotes from a very important book that had been published in the
                    mid-1960s by Lin Biao, Mao's designated successor at that time. Lin described
                    the tactics that the communists had used first against the Japanese and then
                    against the nationalists. It described how communists took power. It was
                    considered at the time to be almost as important as Mao's “Little Red Book.” I
                    used that text because Lin Biao in his book had intimated that the testing place
                    for this action program was now Vietnam. The essential part of the Mao program
                    was to turn the Asian rural areas against the Western urban ones. So I used that
                    thesis as part of my presentation.</p>
                <p>Then the parliamentarians gave their speeches lauding the Vietnamese communists
                    for doing all those good things for their countrymen. Mendelsohn was
                    particularly harsh in his criticism of the U.S. After the presentations, the
                    meeting was open to a question period. All the questions were addressed to me.
                    Of course, they were more short speeches than questions which ended with the
                    question of what I thought of whatever the audience member had said. Since I had
                    heard most of these comments before, I had pretty much a ready reply already
                    thought out. As time went by, the meeting became rowdier; suddenly one of the
                    people who I thought might more objective on the subject - older and prosperous
                    looking - stood up and in very proper English said he had been listening to all
                    of the anti-American accusations for over an hour and that I hadn't had a chance
                    to complete but a few brief sentences. He suggested that I be given five minutes
                    of uninterrupted time for a few comments. The Quaker lady agreed and I began my
                    comments by saying how sad it was that in Great Britain one could hear such
                    attacks on my country. That somehow stimulated me and I went on to speak of the
                    American commitments which we had made to many countries around the world. I
                    said that we would live up to those commitments and that the U.S. could be
                    counted on by its friends and allies. I noted that we intended to live up to our
                    commitments to the Asians just as we did to “you white Europeans.” One could
                    hear a gasp from the audience when I said that.</p>
                <p>In the audience there was a black man who had spent most of the time looking at
                    the ceiling. I assumed he was attending this meeting by mistake. But he stood up
                    and clapped when I had finished my remarks about commitments. That stopped the
                    antagonism and brought the meeting to an end. It was one of my triumphant
                    moments.</p>
                <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                <p>I found speaking about Vietnam a little strange because I had originally opposed
                    U.S. intervention. But I had learned from my parents and from the Marine Corps
                    that it wasn't quite honorable to talk about wars in which one was not involved
                    and from which one was quite far removed. It wasn't quite cricket to do that. So
                    during one of Bill Bundy's visits to London, he asked me whether I would be
                    interested in serving in Vietnam. I told him that I would only be interested if
                    the assignment was in the field - not in Saigon - connected with the war itself.
                    I didn't hear another word about that for a long time until one day in July
                    1967, I got a message asking me whether I could go to Vietnam to work at I-Corps
                    headquarters. I said, “Okay” and off I went to Vietnam.</p>
                <p>Q: Did you have a feeling that in attacking our involvement in Vietnam, many of
                    the British were really showing an anti-American attitude which may have
                    manifested itself in other opportunities?</p>
                <p>CROSS: I suppose that there must have been some of the sentiment among the older
                    generation. But on the whole, the opposition was pretty much a party issue. The
                    Tories thought we were in the right, although they thought it was a losing
                    cause. Many of the Tories were very well informed about Vietnam; I worked with
                    many of them. They urged us to change our approach without abandoning our goals.
                    That to me was a very important aspect of the British experience because I had
                    become acquainted with a major point of view. I think that the British
                    opposition to the Vietnam war was very much akin to that in the U.S. itself.
                    Essentially, it was based on moral principles; they didn't believe it was right
                    to oppose a native nationalist movement, even if communist led. Furthermore,
                    this opposition also had a very negative view of the South Vietnam regimes.</p>
                <p>I think in some cases, I did make a dent in the opposition by pointing out that
                    the communists were attacking a sovereign nation - South Vietnam. It may have
                    been said that South Vietnam left a lot to be desired because of the leadership,
                    but that was hardly an excuse for attacking it. It wasn't happening against
                    other countries whose leadership might not have been to the British liking. I
                    think this argument did resonate with some. We sent some British journalists,
                    like Mark Frankland of The Guardian, to Vietnam and he came back with some very
                    positive comments. He and others had a free hand in Vietnam; they could see and
                    talk to whomever they wanted. Later, when I served in Vietnam, many of these
                    journalists stayed with me and I showed them around.</p>
                <p>I was excited to be assigned to Vietnam, particularly to a rural area.</p>

                <p>CROSS: In Danang. I was the deputy for I Corps after Barney Koren left. There
                    were four of us - i.e., John Paul Vann, Sterling Cottrell, Charlie Whitehouse
                    (later). We were mostly FSOs - except for the famous Vann.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation in I Corps when you arrived?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROSS: I Corps was in the middle of some of the heaviest fighting. At times we
                    had as many as five North Vietnamese divisions on the periphery of the area we
                    were guarding; sometimes of course they would make incursions into the area. The
                    fighting along the DMZ was continuous. We had a very heavy military load. At the
                    same time, the Marines had instituted some very enlightened pacification
                    measures. For example, they had developed some ways to protect the rice crop.
                    They held County Fairs, which they protected. They would also search villages
                    for subversives. All of that protected the villagers against North Vietnamese
                    and VC [Viet Cong] incursions, although there weren't many VC left in our
                    area.</p>
                <p>I had a very good relationship with the commanding general, General Robert
                    Cushman. He gave us full support. We were advisors to the South Vietnamese on
                    all matters except military operations, again with the exception of military
                    operations in support of pacification; we did give advice on those. We had
                    district advisors most of whom were military officers. There were 42 districts
                    in the five provinces of I Corps. The U.S.-South Vietnam establishment in the I
                    Corps area was huge and since we were responsible for all pacification
                    activities - hospitals, education, police, etc - we had 500,000 regional and
                    popular forces in the militia - a heavy workload.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where were most of the South Vietnamese forces?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROSS: There were 2 ARVN divisions in I Corps, roughly: the First in
                    central/north, the Second in the central/south. We had a brigade of South Korean
                    Marines; they were not very good. In I Corps, there were three American
                    divisions: two Marine and one Army - the “Americal.” One of the Marine divisions
                    was on the DMZ; the other was south of there, near Hue and Danang. The Americal
                    was further south and was involved in the My Lai [atrocities].</p>
                <p>Later on, two more Army divisions were added to the command - the 1st Cavalry
                    division and the 101st Airborne. So most of the time we had a lot of troops in
                    the I Corps area and lots of fighting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your job?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                <p>CROSS: As I said, I was the deputy to the Marine commanding general. I was in
                    charge of the pacification program, which was one of the general's major
                    responsibilities. My title was deputy for CORDS [Civil Operations and
                    Revolutionary Development Support] and I was involved in everything. I wrote
                    about my work in great detail in Born a Foreigner (chapters 13-16).</p>
                <p>Refugees were a major problem. About a third of the refugees were really not too
                    far away from their homes. Many had moved just a few miles to live in the larger
                    towns. They were not really refugees; I would call them “disrupted” people. That
                    was a large challenge for us trying to ease the transition for these people.</p>
                <p>We had a number of very good people working in the field; two or three were
                    actually killed. Right at the beginning, I had a difference of views with a guy
                    named De Haan, who was Ted Kennedy's top assistant working on Vietnam. He came
                    out with a group that was working on Laos, although he himself focused on the
                    refugee problem. I told him that the refugee program was not a nation-building
                    program as far as we were concerned; it was intended to take care of a large
                    group of human beings who had no immediate means of support. For some reason, De
                    Haan took my words out of context and used them as part of a Kennedy attack on
                    the whole refugee program. I thought that was a very unfair attack, particularly
                    since it was made in Congress where it got good coverage. I meant to say that it
                    didn't matter what one did for the Vietnamese refugees if they couldn't be
                    assisted, initially anyway, with food and shelter. Those basic necessities came
                    first; it was a task that only we with our resources - capital and human - could
                    do. The South Vietnamese just were not able to take care of these people. Born a
                    Foreigner (pages 176-177) has this difference more clearly than I have just
                    stated it.</p>
                <p>I must admit that I changed my mind later and came to the conclusion that in the
                    refugee program it was vital to have some South Vietnamese participation. But
                    the philosophical difference with Ted Kennedy and his staff soured me on
                    them.</p>
                <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                <p>Most of the American visitors we saw in the I Corps area who were opposed to the
                    war did not change their minds because they saw only what they wanted to see,
                    which would reinforce their preconceived notions. Ted Kennedy and his staff were
                    a case in point. One time, he visited Saigon and looked at the medical services
                    there. He was then going to come to Danang. We were instructed to make sure that
                    every minute of his time was filled because he didn't have time to wait. One of
                    his staffers came first and when he saw the program that we have developed, he
                    said that it would have to be changed entirely. He told us that Kennedy was
                    totally booked in Saigon, visiting one hospital after another, but he was not
                    seeing any war casualties. He wanted to see wounded civilians who had been
                    “victims” of American gunfire. I told the staffer that perhaps Kennedy might not
                    be able to find what he was looking for. In Danang at that moment, there may
                    have been no more than ten people who might have been harmed by Viet Cong and
                    North Vietnamese mines; by far the largest number of occupants in hospitals were
                    sick from malaria or other diseases or burned by stoves. There may have been
                    times when there was a larger number of wounded. Nor were the wounded always our
                    fault. Many came from mines laid by the Viet Cong. This whole experience really
                    embittered me because I thought that people like Kennedy were looking for any
                    excuse to destroy the good work that we were doing. People who had no
                    preconceived notions, like the British ambassador, Sir Murray McLehose, Bob
                    Scalopino - a well known scholar - and some journalists, were willing to see the
                    situation as it was and would go with me to visit all parts of our area. They
                    would follow me around while I was doing my work and observe our efforts. When
                    we were in a helicopter, I had a chance to explain to them what I saw as the
                    situation on the ground. They got a balanced view of the situation because they
                    were seeing the same things that I was.</p>
                <p>These people were impressed by what they saw and heard. They heard junior
                    military and Foreign Service officers express their desire to do more in terms
                    of the pacification program if they only had the necessary resources; they would
                    point out that certain programs could not be conducted for military reasons. A
                    listener might well have come away realizing that despite the many problems,
                    there were some solutions and that things might work out. When I left Vietnam, I
                    was confident that we were on the right track.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there for Tet?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROSS: I am glad you asked about that because one of my FSO friends was captured
                    during Tet. I had just returned from a ten-day leave in London the middle of
                    January. There had been a couple of bomb incidents in Danang near our office. I
                    had been briefed that the North Vietnamese were making a major move south,
                    moving a large number of troops, many apparently targeted at Danang. At the same
                    time, the North had asked for a truce to last over the Tet holidays. The South
                    Vietnamese had publically agreed to that proposal. So despite the intelligence
                    reports, the South was reluctant to take any action which might subject them to
                    criticism for opposing or violating a truce. We tried to tell them what we
                    thought was happening, but we couldn't convince them to take any action - even
                    defensive as it may have been.</p>
                <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                <p>One day before Tet, I called all the of the senior advisors in the provinces. All
                    the provincial capitals had been attacked in 1967, except for Hue. So when I
                    suggested that they might be attacked again, they were prepared. Our guy in Hue
                    was Phil Manhard, who was a good friend - I got him that assignment. He had been
                    in Hue since Thanksgiving and I think he had good control of the situation. He
                    also had been a Marine and therefore had some experience in warfare. Phil said
                    that he would bring his people together, but not in the MACV compound. That was
                    the last word I had with Phil; he was captured and remained in North Vietnamese
                    prisons for five years and two months.</p>
                <p>The night before Tet all of the servants had the evening off to celebrate. I was
                    invited to the nurses' apartment as the senior civilian in the area. We shot off
                    firecrackers in the backyard after dinner and heard similar explosions all
                    around town - not legal, but done anyway. As the evening went on, so did the
                    firecrackers. Somewhere along about midnight, you could begin to hear those
                    noises interspersed with heavy machine gun fire, followed by rockets. Then the
                    firecrackers stopped to be followed by some very large explosions. These were
                    from rockets that the North Vietnamese were firing into the town. There was some
                    fighting in the outskirts around the I Corps headquarters. The Marines were not
                    attacked directly; the North concentrated on South Vietnamese troops.</p>
                <p>By the end of the next day, it became clear that the North's offensive had only
                    been successful in Hue, which they overran - except for the American military
                    compounds. The rest of the city was entirely under their control. We had Marines
                    south of the city which we moved north; but we didn't have many reports of what
                    was going on except for those people who were in the MAC V compound, who really
                    were not aware of what was happening in Hue itself. The North captured some 20
                    of our people in Hue; they killed seven of the American CORDS people. As I said,
                    Phil was among those captured. The VC invaded his house, but couldn't find him
                    because he had retreated to a hidden room in the house. The VC grabbed the
                    servants who were threatened with sure death if they did not get Phil to
                    surrender. The North Vietnamese were apparently working from a checklist and
                    knew exactly whom they were looking for.</p>
                <pb facs="0067" n="Page0067"/>
                <p>So Phil surrendered, but I have always assumed that the servants were killed
                    anyway. They took Phil off somewhere near Hue, took his shoes away and tortured
                    him for a couple of days. Then they dragged him and the other captives to the
                    north on a journey that took several weeks. They had to be hidden often because
                    obviously we and the South Vietnamese looked for them intently. Eventually, Phil
                    was put in solitary confinement; behind his cell was a very small outside
                    enclosure which held a cistern and toilet. That was also his exercise area. He
                    was never allowed to use the area when the person in the next cell was out
                    there. A sentry would come into the cell to make sure that Phil would not leave.
                    One day, someone peered over the outside cell wall and whispered, “Are you an
                    American?” Phil gave him a signal that the guard was in the cell with him.
                    Later, the other man threw a cigarette wrapping into the enclosure which
                    contained a tap code. Phil memorized that code and then communicated with the
                    fellow in the next cell. They tried to remember all the names of the people they
                    had encountered. This fellow eventually was sent to the “Hanoi Hilton” and
                    reported to his fellow prisoners that he had met Phil, who secretly got the news
                    home. That was the first indication that we had that he was still alive. This
                    was 1969 or 1970.</p>
                <p>Phil was totally incommunicado after the U.S. Army officer next door was taken
                    away - until a German nurse was assigned to the cell next to him. She discovered
                    a pencil-sized canal between the cells which drained water and used it to
                    transmit messages to Phil using cigarette wrapping that she poked through the
                    canal with a stick. He sent replies back, poking the same paper. That opened a
                    channel of communications.</p>
                <p>Eventually, the North Vietnamese figured out that Phil was the highest ranking
                    American in North Vietnamese hands. They wanted to hear his views on all sorts
                    of issues. They sent an “interrogator” who was nicknamed “Walter Cronkite.” Six
                    months after an event took place, the North Vietnamese would try to get Phil's
                    views as if the event had just occurred. He was asked about such developments as
                    Johnson's withdrawal from the presidential race in October 1968 when Johnson had
                    announced his decision in April. One day in 1972, he was taken to Hanoi for
                    treatment for a carbuncle on his back. When he was better, he was treated to a
                    dinner before going back to the camp. His host was apparently a high ranking
                    Vietnamese, according to his guard. This man assumed that the peace negotiations
                    were moving along well enough in late 1972 so that the North Vietnamese could
                    begin to think about opening an embassy in Washington. So Phil was asked a lot
                    of questions about what that might entail logistically. By this time, of course,
                    Phil didn't really know, having been out of contact with the world for five
                    years. But they left Phil with the impression that the war was practically
                    over.</p>
                <pb facs="0068" n="Page0068"/>
                <p>Phil remembered that experience quite well. Two interesting developments came
                    from this conversation. His interlocutor turned out eventually to be a vice
                    foreign minister. He told Phil that the Soviet Union had been urging North
                    Vietnam to retreat on questions of “our national interests.” But the North
                    Vietnamese responded to Soviet president Podgorny that taking such a stance
                    would not only create great objections from the North Vietnamese people, but the
                    whole socialist world would find it repulsive. Phil asked whether the Chinese
                    had participated. He was told that Zhou En-lai had come and had urged the same
                    things. But he didn't get anywhere either; the North Vietnamese were not about
                    to do either the Soviets' or the Chinese's bidding.</p>
                <p>Eventually, Phil was sent to the “Hanoi Hilton” himself. By this time, in early
                    1973, I was in the Department's Policy Planning staff. I was one of the few
                    people who knew Phil well - our families were quite close. When it came time to
                    bring the American prisoners home, the military sent a friend of each prisoner
                    to bring him back. I was sent to bring Phil home. That was a real
                    experience.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you do after the Tet offensive?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROSS: Our first job was to insure that those programs that we had managed to
                    start in the rural areas were resurrected. For a while, all of South Vietnam
                    went into a state of shock. It turned out that we were in fact in better shape
                    than we had anticipated because the North Vietnamese, in order to attack the
                    small cities and towns, had bypassed the villages and then attacked their main
                    targets, most of which they did not conquer. The North Vietnamese took extremely
                    high casualties so that when the offensive was over, there were very few traces
                    of VC or North Vietnamese in the rural areas. So they could not impede our
                    pacification efforts. Once these facts became clear, we really turned up the
                    vigor of our programs. By May - or a few months after Tet - we were going full
                    steam, even though Saigon had to withstand another attack. Hue had to be
                    rebuilt.</p>
                <p>The Tet offensive had some positive effects. For example, through blood drives,
                    Danang was collecting only a few pints of blood. After Tet, they collected 300
                    pints in a very few days. Those province chiefs who had not performed adequately
                    during the Tet period were replaced. There were quite a few who did very well
                    and fought the enemy quite well once they got organized.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What happened in Hue?</hi>

                <p>CROSS: Eventually, the Marines found ways to fight the North Vietnamese off.
                    Before that happened, the North Vietnamese executed people. I think they killed
                    about 3,000 inhabitants. It was a massacre. We had seven guys killed in our Hue
                    CORDS programs. One was an FSR by the name of Miller. He had just graduated from
                    Harvard and had taken a temporary commission to go to Vietnam. A wonderful guy -
                    eager about his work with the Vietnamese. He was among those killed by the
                    enemy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who were the South Vietnamese who were shot in Hue?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROSS: It was a long list which included government people, th“prosperous” ones.
                    It was a very sizeable proportion of the population.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this seen as an example of what would happen if the

                </p>
                <p>CROSS: The Vietnamese in I Corps were a tough bunch from top to bottom. In my
                    opinion most of the Viet Cong from that province, if not all, were eliminated
                    after Tet; they were descendants of revolutionary groups that had fought the
                    French. They had come from Hanoi. They were a tough bunch. So we had two groups
                    which were well matched. The South Vietnamese were from the south-east delta
                    area - not from large cities like Saigon. I think that part of my optimism was
                    that good province chiefs were being assigned to my area, as well as some very
                    tough soldiers. I think we were actually winning the military war; we were able
                    to protect the population and property. That left me with a slightly optimistic
                    view about South Vietnam's future when I left the country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get involved at all in the battle for Khe
                        Sanh?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROSS: Khe Sanh was the subject of many morning staff meetings. I only went to
                    Khe Sanh when it had been secured after the battle. It was an example of
                    Westmoreland's attrition strategy. With our air superiority we could do a lot of
                    damage from the air. We saturated the area with bombs - day after day after day.
                    The VC and the North Vietnamese took an awful beating, and we did as well.
                    Eventually, both sides left the area. It was a very sad chapter. I would guess
                    that at least 10,000 North Vietnamese and 600 of our Americans died in Khe Sanh.
                    It had no strategic value; I think the main reason for the North Vietnamese
                    actions was to draw American troops away from pacification.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How effective were the South Korean military?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0070" n="Page0070"/>
                <p>CROSS: I didn't have a chance to watch their army, but I was told it fought quite
                    effectively. The two South Korean divisions were in II Corps. We had one brigade
                    of Korean marines. Their officers looted the PXs [post exchanges] all the time.
                    Furthermore, when they had to protect themselves, they were very aggressive.
                    They held on to the territory assigned to them, but in doing so, were quite hard
                    on the local population. I received several reports of massacres by the Korean
                    marines. The American general would raise hell with the Korean general, but it
                    didn't have much effect. I don't think it was clear to the Korean military why
                    they were in Vietnam, other than they had been ordered to go there.</p>
                <p>Q: That may have been true for a number of “allies” such as the Thai. They also
                    looted the PXs in Saigon and would drive off in their trucks filled with the
                    goodies.</p>
                <p>CROSS: The PXs that were American-run did not suffer from raids bAmerican
                    soldiers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was it to work with a young FSO or FSR who may have
                        beetotally unprepared for war or the pacification programs?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROSS: It was interesting. Many had spent their academic lives studying European
                    history or some other entirely unrelated subject. But I don't think we could
                    have recruited a more superb bunch of guys. Many of them objected to our
                    participation in the war, but once they got to know the Vietnamese and the
                    American GIs who were interested in helping the Vietnamese, they really
                    performed well and were very popular. They were all very decent and put their
                    hearts and souls into doing a good job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Terry McNamara was the consul in Danang. I guess he was
                        undeyour supervision, but he seemed to operate pretty much
                        independently.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROSS: He did fit his operations into those of I Corps and CORDS very well. He
                    wanted to have another Foreign Service assignment and that is the way he viewed
                    his job in Danang. He didn't want to be seen as being outside the “mainstream”
                    as we were. I remember discussing this issue with him and telling him that none
                    of us, including he himself, were doing “Foreign Service work.” I pointed out
                    that as a senior officer, I certainly was not in a regular assignment, but that
                    it was incumbent on me and all of our FSO and FSR officers to make the CORDS
                    program work. That called for the full cooperation of the military as well as
                    the consulate. He performed well, but he just didn't want to be known as part of
                    the team. That irritated me in some respects, but he ended up in Can Tho with
                    the same kind of job I had in I Corps years later.</p>
                <p>Q: Did you have any problems with the U.S. military officers? In the Army, they
                    tended to spend six months with the troops and six months in a staff job before
                    being returned to the U.S.</p>
                <pb facs="0071" n="Page0071"/>
                <p>CROSS: These officers wanted to “punch two tickets” on the same tour. That is one
                    of reasons why the staffs were so large and cumbersome. What were called the
                    “maneuver” battalions were not really a big part of the American military effort
                    and many of those officers served later with CORDS. We did have many differences
                    with these officers, but we had some hold over them because all the senior
                    officers received efficiency reports from us. So they at least pretended to pay
                    attention to us. They used to be very upset unless each of their efficiency
                    reports said that they were the “most outstanding” officers we had ever
                    seen.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get involved in planning military operations?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROSS: Yes, I did. We had the use of the military staff; I had a personal aide, a
                    Marine first lieutenant. We could use the staff in any way we wanted; we had our
                    own staff, which worked with the Vietnamese units in the provinces. So if we
                    heard of a major operation that they wanted to conduct - search and destroy or
                    to meet a potential attack from a North Vietnamese force - we would steer them
                    away from areas where large numbers of refugees might be created by the military
                    action. This helped both us and them.</p>
                <p>When I was in Danang I had my own staff coordinating with militarstaffs so that
                    we could support the efforts of the Marines.</p>
                <p>Q: I think that one of our problems was that people served in their jobs for such
                    a short time that by the time they began to become familiar with their
                    responsibilities, it was almost time to leave. I remember being chairman of a
                    civilian board with responsibilities similar to those of a court martial for
                    civilians who worked in the black market or other civilian violations. I was the
                    institutional memory having been in Saigon for nine months or so.</p>
                <p>CROSS: The problem was not that acute for the CORDS people; they stayed longer.
                    Furthermore, many were true experts. We had people from the Department of
                    Agriculture who knew their stuff and had also served overseas before. They were
                    able to assist in increasing rice production in the provinces. They established
                    an immediate and close rapport with the Vietnamese farmers. It helped that many
                    of the civilians were accustomed to working with foreigners, which the military
                    was not. We advised the military on various approaches that might be made to the
                    Vietnamese civilian society. I did, but rarely, with Cushman, the Marine
                    commander, who had a fine touch in any case.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How effective were the “popular forces” that defended the
                        hamlets?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0072" n="Page0072"/>
                <p>CROSS: They were the key to any successes. They were tremendously helpful if they
                    were strong and “popular” - in the sense that they were from the village or
                    hamlet - ones that wouldn't just surrender at the first sight of a VC. We had a
                    lot of great “popular forces.” Some were completely wiped out because the South
                    Vietnamese forces didn't respond on a timely basis. The Marines developed CAPS
                    (Combined Action Platoons); they were a group a little larger than a regular
                    squad. The leader knew the rules of engagement. They used to live in a hamlet
                    and made friends; they protected the hamlet, trained the “popular forces” and
                    teamed up with them. Then we had a Marine Reaction Force which was ready to
                    support the CAPS if any gunfire began. That was a good set-up. The CAPS did a
                    lot of good work; they played with the kids, taught them something, helped with
                    minor construction. It was a well-conceived program. The CAPS stayed until the
                    area had been secured.</p>
                <p>I learned a lot about being a general because that was the level at which I
                    operated and I had an aide and a cook, etc. I don't think the military ever
                    leveled with us. I got a lot of cooperation because I had been a Marine myself,
                    but I got the straight army attitude as well. At the high level, there was a
                    strong feeling of competition and concern for professional reputation. I don't
                    think that the military in general had a very high opinion of us civilians. They
                    never showed any sign of being discourteous. They would sometimes tell me that
                    they couldn't do something or other; then the chief of staff would be called and
                    he would have to take on the burden of being negative, if that was the way it
                    had to be. That was a game they played - a very intricate game.</p>
                <p>I must say that we in the pacification program were not very admiring of
                    Westmoreland. Bob Komer was the father of CORDS. He had the right idea, but
                    unfortunately the wrong personality. He was a difficult and mean guy, although I
                    never had any problems with him. So Komer had trouble getting along, which Bill
                    Colby did not. When General Abrams succeeded Westmoreland and with Colby in
                    Saigon, we probably had the best military-civilian leadership team. The top team
                    was very good. I wanted to get home to see my family; had I stayed, I think I
                    would have been part of a major success which I think really started in
                    1970-71.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When I was in Saigon from 1969 to 1970, I thought that
                        progreswas being made.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0073" n="Page0073"/>
                <p>CROSS: I think that somewhere along the line the opposition to the war came to a
                    head and Congress just abandoned the war effort. I have made the following point
                    in my book - it is also very fundamental to military analysis of the war: we did
                    not lose the war; in fact we were more than holding our own. We left Vietnam
                    because our democratic system had elected officials who forced us to withdraw
                    due to the strong national feelings. Therefore, the military reasoned that
                    despite the very high stakes that our leaders had set in Vietnam, despite all
                    the casualties, despite that we were not losing, we left. That taught the
                    military a lesson, I think, and that was that wars like Vietnam would not have
                    any domestic support; a military action had to have a clear beginning and a
                    clear ending when the pre-stated objectives had been met. They believed that in
                    this world, our military should be engaged only to protect U.S. national
                    interests and not to advance American interests. I think that is the national
                    consensus.</p>
                <p>I want to mention one more thing about Vietnam. I was there during the My Lai
                    massacre, but I didn't hear of it until I went to Singapore years later. Seymour
                    Hersh had his story published all over the world: I was sick to my stomach when
                    I heard about it because that hamlet was in the I Corps area. It had happened
                    three weeks after I had taken over; I was asked to testify about this incident
                    by a commission chaired by General Peers. But I couldn't return to Washington at
                    the time and therefore submitted a deposition instead. I had to admit that I
                    didn't know about the incident. Under normal circumstances, the system required
                    that I be informed whenever any civilians were killed as result of American
                    action. Normally, I would have heard about it through Vietnamese-CORDS channels,
                    but in this case, I didn't hear a word. So in my deposition, I pointed the
                    finger at several officers including the deputy province advisor who was the
                    deputy to Jim May. That deputy just didn't pass the word up the command because
                    he didn't want the battalion commander in trouble. The whole episode was a big
                    disgrace. General Koster, who was the senior officer in the Corps area, was sent
                    to West Point as commandant not long after the massacre. He was not what I
                    consider to be a figure to be emulated; I wouldn't have left the education of
                    young officers in his hands.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CROSS: I didn't have very much to do with them. They were in the Khe Sanh area. I
                    think that they were essentially cheated by us; we used them too often and had
                    them do too much. The overall Special Forces commander was an officer who was a
                    classmate at the War College. He was a good guy, but I think they pushed those
                    people too far.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of CIA's work in your area?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0074" n="Page0074"/>
                <p>CROSS: The CIA was an integral part of our efforts. They ran the Revolutionary
                    Development teams. The guys I worked with were first class. The senior advisor
                    in a town just south of Danang was a CIA officer who previously had been in
                    Mexico. He was so good that I selected him to be my deputy. He did a fantastic
                    job. CIA had some rough types among its staff, particularly in the PRUs
                    (Provincial Reconnaissance Units). They were doing some things they weren't
                    supposed to do. Some of the PRU advisers were regular U.S. Army officers, some
                    were New Zealanders and Australians. I used to worry about PRU activities
                    because they could arrest or assassinate people and in general act outside the
                    rules we had laid down, although I think our advisers were basically
                    well-disciplined. The PRUs were Vietnamese operating against Vietnamese.</p>
                <p>The Phoenix program was long overdue. It didn't really get started because the
                    U.S. army and CIA couldn't get their acts together. It took several years even
                    to get a program designed. We finally assigned U.S. military advisors to South
                    Vietnam units, but the program really didn't get started until after I left and
                    Bill Colby got control of it. Ted Shackley, the Saigon CIA chief, didn't
                    particularly want CIA to be involved; he didn't think it was an appropriate role
                    for agency officers.</p>
                <p>Q: The problem as I understood it was in identifying the target and then “taking
                    him out.” Wasn't there something akin going on while you were in Danang?</p>
                <p>CROSS: Of course; the PRUs were doing this all the time. We had control of them -
                    theoretically - their operations were supposed to be approved by the provincial
                    senior advisor - or sometimes by the district advisor. They would pick a target,
                    but sometimes their intelligence about an individual was not entirely
                    accurate.</p>
                <p>Q: The Vietnamese general in the I Corps area was General Hoang Xuan Lam. I have
                    heard stories that he may not have been entirely forthright. Was that true?</p>
                <p>CROSS: He was considered to be more honest than his subordinate with the 2nd
                    Division. He was not a soldier at the same level as General Troung, who was the
                    1st Division commander and was considered to be an outstanding officer who would
                    have been so considered in any military organization. Lam was more political; he
                    was considered to be a Thieu supporter from the beginning. When Thieu became
                    president, Lam rose from a lieutenant colonel to a lieutenant general almost
                    overnight.</p>
                <p>There was no indication that Lam was stealing warehouses full of stuff. His
                    misdemeanors were pettier than that. He was not always quick to remove
                    commanders and province chiefs who were known to be on the take. That was our
                    major problem with Lam. I never saw any real proof of his profiteering. We had a
                    lot of information about some of the province chiefs, but they all had been
                    replaced by the time I left Vietnam. They used to play poker with each other;
                    that was the way they paid each other off.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CROSS: They were centered in Hue. I think they really were trouble in the early
                    1960s, but by the time I got there, they had been pretty much brought under
                    control, although we used to watch them warily, because as Buddhists, they
                    really had no philosophical attachment to either side.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did Thieu interfere with our operations in the I Corps

                </p>
                <p>CROSS: As I said, General Lam was his guy. Troung got along with Thieu because he
                    was such a good soldier and we kept telling Thieu that. General Ky came often.
                    He didn't trust us Americans very much. One time, Cushman and I were invited to
                    have lunch with Ky and three or four Vietnamese generals and a couple of
                    Vietnamese civilians. We were the only Americans. They talked Vietnamese most of
                    the time among themselves; every once in a while, they would address a question
                    to us in English. At the end, they all stopped talking and Ky said, “We believe
                    that the United States will leave us. What do you have to say to that?” Cushman
                    denied it; he said he thought that we were too deeply involved to withdraw. Ky
                    argued that we would not stay until the end. I said that I thought we would stay
                    as long as it appeared that the South Vietnamese seemed serious about their war
                    efforts. That ended the conversation. I didn't report it because our embassy in
                    Saigon hated to hear that kind of view.</p>

                <p>CROSS: There were many officers at my level who criticized the way the war was
                    being fought. At the junior level, there were quite a few who were outspokenly
                    against the war; most had been ROTC graduates who were sent to Vietnam for their
                    tour of duty. But in my area, I thought the command handled them quite cleverly.
                    The young officers were told that they would be in Vietnam for a year and
                    therefore might as well spend the time profitably. It was suggested that they
                    seek employment with CORDS where they could help the Vietnamese directly. Many
                    of them did that and when their tour was up, went home feeling that they had had
                    a positive experience.</p>

                <p>CROSS: Upon my return to Washington, I was almost immediately asked whether I
                    would be interested in becoming our ambassador to Singapore. I don't know why
                    that happened, but I think Bill Bundy, then assistant secretary for FE, was
                    behind it. So I spent the summer as deputy assistant secretary and then went to
                    Singapore. The senior deputy was Win Brown; my area covered everything but
                    Vietnam, which was Bill Sullivan's bailiwick. Sullivan headed a task force which
                    essentially reported to Kissinger, who then was the head of the NSC.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CROSS: Mel Laird, the new secretary of defense, was a college classmate. Laird
                    wanted me to come to work for him and the Department supported that idea. But it
                    was too late, since the ambassadorship had already been offered and accepted. I
                    didn't really want to go to the Pentagon. But I did write two memoranda, neither
                    of which made much of an impression. The first one dealt with “Vietnamization;”
                    I took issue with that term because my view was that the war had always been a
                    Vietnamese affair. There was no way that the war could be “turned over” to the
                    Vietnamese - it was theirs to start with. I suggested that the phrase
                    “de-Americanization” be used because that was a much better description of our
                    decreased involvement in the fighting without giving the impression that the
                    South Vietnamese would be helpless without us. My suggestion was squarely
                    against the administration's efforts to distance itself from the war.</p>
                <p>In my second memorandum, I suggested that if we were going to withdraw, we should
                    not take measures to “improve the war.” The efforts to improve the war did not
                    deal only with guns, but also with the military engineers, for example, who
                    looked at what the previous engineers had done in laying square meters of cement
                    and then tried to outdo that. All the new roads that were being built to make it
                    easier for the military to travel and other measures to make life easier for our
                    military, should be stopped. We should leave combat troops in Vietnam, also the
                    special forces and turn over to the Vietnamese all of the infrastructure work we
                    were doing. That suggestion also fell on deaf ears.</p>

                    challenged on my views and soon thereafter I was confirmed.</p>

                <p>CROSS: I didn't have too much contact with him. I think Marshall wanted someone
                    else to go to Singapore. I admired some things about Marshall. He was extremely
                    competent, but we didn't always see eye to eye. There were three other people in
                    the Yale class of 1939 who became senior members of the foreign policy
                    establishment dealing with East Asia at the same time: Marshall Green, Mac
                    Godley, and Bill Bundy. They kept in close contact after graduation. As I said,
                    it was Bill Bundy who wanted me to go to Singapore, even before I was assigned
                    to Vietnam. I was told later that the Department leaned on Bundy to let me go to
                    Vietnam; he never mentioned that to me.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CROSS: I was given a great build-up. I really wanted to go to Kuala Lumpur where
                    I had been previously; it also was a bigger post. But Singapore sounded good and
                    my predecessor, Frank Galbraith, was one of my best friends in the Service. He
                    gave us a very good start. I am glad that we didn't end up in Malaysia; it would
                    have been too much of a repetition of my previous experiences - the
                    Malay-Chinese tensions. Singapore had a lot of glamor. Many large American
                    businesses had their Asian headquarters there.</p>
                <p>Lee Kwan Yew and I got along reasonably well, at the beginning. The issues were
                    primarily technical. I used Lee very often and when he caught on, he was very
                    good. I had him talk about the “big picture.” Lee Kwan Yew was really an
                    international figure, and he knew the world well. He had very good ideas.
                    American presidents like Lyndon Johnson and Richard Nixon used to seek his
                    advice. Kissinger also used him as a sounding board. He was more articulate than
                    either Johnson or Nixon - even in English. Actually, he spoke English much
                    better than Chinese. Lee supported our efforts in Vietnam. He would call me in
                    periodically and ask whether some action that the U.S. had taken meant that we
                    would withdraw from Vietnam. He always opposed that, since he felt that we
                    brought some stability to South-East Asia. He was always very clear on why we
                    should not leave Vietnam.</p>
                <p>Q: What were American interests in Singapore?</p>
                <p>CROSS: We had several. First, we were discovering oil in quite a few places in
                    the immediate area. None of it was in Singapore, but the drillers didn't want to
                    headquarter in KL or Jakarta. They preferred Singapore, which was clean and safe
                    and had good repair facilities, particularly for the vessels. So the oil
                    business suddenly blossomed.</p>
                <pb facs="0078" n="Page0078"/>
                <p>Then Singapore became interested in developing itself into a regional banking
                    center. It had always been a safe haven for money from the rich in other
                    countries, but Singapore really encouraged foreign banks to open regional
                    headquarters. American banks became well represented.</p>
                <p>Singapore developed a very sophisticated and highly organized foreign investment
                    process. They organized industrial parks which were very efficient and
                    attractive. That also attracted American business. When I arrived, there were
                    only two or three electronic firms in Singapore working in Singapore; when I
                    left there were eighteen. The first ones were given huge incentives; the next
                    few were given more modest incentives and the last five were not given any. The
                    last one in fact was told that it was the last one to be allowed to move into
                    Singapore. Most of these manufacturers were working on sophisticated equipment,
                    with semi-conductors having already moved to a place with cheaper labor.</p>
                <p>I think our investment in Singapore grew geometrically while I was there; I think
                    it was about $2 billion by the time I left. The American population grew from
                    about 2,000 to about 8,000 in two years. I think the embassy provided good
                    support to American business and people.</p>
                <p>I ran into some difficulties with former Vice President Agnew. He wanted to visit
                    Singapore. He had been subjected to Kennedy's snobbery. The men who worked for
                    him were sure that they were on the second team. He wanted very much to meet Lee
                    Kwan Yew but had to invite himself to Singapore. On his first visit, he did have
                    a meeting with Lee, which went smoothly. We played golf over my objections; Lee
                    was a very good golfer and his minister of defense was almost a pro. I suggested
                    that our army attach� be invited in my place; his handicap was much lower than
                    mine. That didn't fly. In any case, I was scared to death by this golf match. I
                    really got scared when the PAO came to me and said, with a big smile, that he
                    had arranged for American TV coverage of the tee-off.</p>
                <p>So we all went out to this beautiful golf course. Behind the tee, I saw the
                    scaffolding for the TV cameras. It was decided that the minister of defense, Goh
                    Keng Swee, and I would play Lee and Agnew. Lee started off by stating, “I'll
                    show you the way!” He hit a strange drive about 150 yards off to the right in
                    deep rough. I am sure that he had never done that before. Then Agnew teed off
                    and hit a high fly that went into the jungle. The minister then hit a screaming
                    drive that hit the trees off to the left. That left it up to me; I had never hit
                    any shots like those. I started to drive and as I was doing so I heard the
                    whirring of the cameras. My ball just bounced along the ground and stopped right
                    in front of a very serious group of spectators who were politely not laughing. I
                    think they were the chauffeurs. The camera had no other player to cover since
                    the other three had hit balls where the cameras could not cover them, so I had
                    to hit again on camera until I was finally out of sight.</p>
                <pb facs="0079" n="Page0079"/>
                <p>I thoroughly blotted my copy book because my team, thanks to Goh who played well,
                    ended up being ahead of the Lee-Agnew duo on the last hole. I had a very short
                    putt - 2 to 3 feet - and if I had made it we would have won. But I was short and
                    the two teams ended up in a tie. That didn't help my reputation at all because
                    everyone in Singapore plays golf as if his life depended upon it.</p>
                <p>I thought that Lee and Agnew got along well. Lee told him all about his views of
                    our efforts in Vietnam and what he hoped the U.S. would do in the area - views
                    that I had reported many times to the Department. It was good that Agnew heard
                    them; he could confirm my reports.</p>
                <p>Soon after that visit, I went to a chiefs of mission conference at Clark Field.
                    When I came back, I was greeted by my DCM with a report that Lee Kwan Yew was
                    attacking three sacred American institutions: The New York Times (they had
                    decided to throw its stringer out), the Chase Manhattan Bank, and the CIA. Lee
                    claimed that CIA and the Bank were engaged in supporting a newspaper - The
                    Singapore Herald - that he wanted to close down. He wanted the Bank to foreclose
                    on a small loan it had made to this newspaper to buy a printing press. Lee went
                    through a mean, grinding attack in an effort to get the Bank to do his bidding.
                    It came out later that Lee had gotten it into his head that the U.S. wanted to
                    establish a newspaper in Singapore that might oppose him.</p>
                <p>There was a lady in Hong Kong who was a member of a big and rich overseas Chinese
                    family. That family ran a couple of Hong Kong newspapers. She had loaned the
                    Herald a fairly large sum for those days - I think it was $200,000. She was
                    invited to Singapore where she had a meeting with Lee which lasted for about
                    five hours - it was more of an interrogation than a conversation. She finally
                    broke down when Lee accused her of subversion and demanded that she withdraw her
                    support of the Herald. She finally agreed. The next day Lee called in the Chase
                    Manhattan representative and asked whether the Bank would stick by its loan even
                    if the lady withdrew her support. The Bank guy said that he couldn't answer
                    because the Bank had specific procedures to decide such questions that he would
                    have to follow. Lee viewed that as a refusal despite the representative's
                    assurance that he could not say “Yea or Nay.” He did note that there would be
                    some question about the loan if the Herald was seen as unable to repay.</p>
                <p>The next morning, Lee called in the European manager of Chase Manhattan and
                    discussed this issue with him and Foreign Minister Rajaratnam for three straight
                    hours. At the end, Lee Kwan Yew opened the drawer next to where he was sitting
                    and pulled out a tape recorder. He told the Chase Manhattan guy that all of his
                    comments had been taped. The manager had agreed that the loan might well be
                    recalled if it did not seem likely that it could be repaid. Then he went to the
                    door, and when he opened it, the room was filled with TV cameras and reporters.
                    He told the manager that he wanted him to repeat everything that he told him.
                    When the manager was finished, Lee told the media that they had just heard a
                    sample of U.S. interference in the affairs of other countries.</p>
                <pb facs="0080" n="Page0080"/>
                <p>I reported this story to Washington. The next day, at our staff meeting, I
                    mentioned that I would try to get in touch with David Rockefeller and try to
                    smooth the ruffled waters. I told the staff that we would not take a public
                    position on this dispute; if we had to make a statement, I would make it on the
                    basis of instructions from Washington. I knew that CIA had been caught twice in
                    the last four years in operations and was afraid this was another but was
                    officially assured it was not. This tension lasted for a few days and seemed to
                    be calming down. Then I got a message from the Department announcing that
                    someone from the CIA was arriving, carrying a message from the then director,
                    Dick Helms. The last time CIA was caught with its hands in the cookie jar, Dick
                    Helms had promised Lee Kwan Yew that it would never happen again. The CIA agent
                    did not have a personal relationship with Lee, and I think Lee knew perfectly
                    well that whatever he was complaining about was not a U.S. operation.</p>
                <p>Anyway, the CIA representative arrived and we met with Lee. Lee gave all his
                    reasons why he thought that the operation was an American one. After that,
                    tensions were reduced. Lee kept calling me in, producing evidence of the U.S.
                    supporting newspapers abroad which was being provided to him by British friends,
                    but was not at all apropos of his charges. It was obvious that all he was
                    interested in was in closing the Herald.</p>
                <p>One day, I got a personal message from the Secretary of State announcing that
                    Agnew was coming to Singapore again. I replied to the Secretary that I thought
                    this was not the time for the U.S. to be seen as making a gesture of esteem. I
                    immediately got a reply telling me that he was coming anyway and that he could
                    help me with “my problems” with Lee. I told the Department that I didn't have
                    any problems with Lee; on the contrary, I had very good relationships with him.
                    The problem was the U.S.Agnew arrived and we had a meeting with Lee. Agnew told
                    Lee that he had looked into his charges of a CIA operation and that he was
                    convinced that there wasn't such a thing. Then he had to go on - and I can't
                    imagine who gave him this suggestion - to tell Lee that a large government such
                    as ours appreciated being told when something appeared to be going wrong.</p>
                <p>About two months later I got a message telling me that the Department wished to
                    transfer me. It wanted to change ambassadors. I got a separate message from
                    Marshall Green suggesting that I accept the transfer without complaint because
                    Lee Kwan Yew allegedly said he would prefer another ambassador, which, by the
                    way, was probably true in light of his many public statements about the U.S. One
                    of my staff, who had been working in the control room for the Agnew visit, had
                    heard from one of Agnew's people that the former vice-president had been
                    disturbed by the harsh exchanges that he had overheard me having with Lee. He
                    was particularly unhappy about my opposition to his visit because he was
                    concerned that Nixon would see it and come to the conclusion that Agnew couldn't
                    handle even a minor problem. Of course, I think that Nixon could not have cared
                    less what Agnew did or did not do in Singapore.</p>
                <pb facs="0081" n="Page0081"/>
                <p>In the final analysis, I think Agnew was unhappy with me not only for my
                    objections to his visit, but also because I had worked for Harriman. He had been
                    given this information by one of his military attach�s. That was the straw that
                    broke the camel's back; I was viewed as being unreliable. So Agnew was
                    responsible for my transfer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why did Lee take after the U.S.?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROSS: Inexplicable. I think he thought that the U.S. wanted to establish a
                    newspaper which over time would mouth its “propaganda.” Theoretically, that
                    would give us influence in Singapore. The Herald had done some things which were
                    pretty wild - for Singapore - and that may perhaps have given Lee the idea that
                    we were behind it. For example, the Herald mentioned that the PAP ( Lee's
                    political party) had helped certain people to avoid national service. The
                    Singaporeans were very proud of their national service because it was an
                    excellent way to integrate the society, both racially and economically, thereby
                    creating a national identity and a sense of intra-state collaboration. It was
                    impeccably run, as far as I could tell. In any case, the newspaper was accused
                    of trying to undermine this system. That really irritated Lee Kwan Yew, even
                    though I thought the newspaper was pretty mild. In the end, Lee just closed the
                    paper. I mentioned earlier that I had talked to David Rockefeller about the
                    Chase Manhattan loan. I finally found him in Latin America. He was besieged by
                    journalists from all over the world who were obviously unhappy with Lee Kwan
                    Yew's actions. I suggested that Rockefeller not do anything exceptional.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any thought that you knew of about the Bank
                        leavinSingapore?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROSS: No. I didn't think anything at all would happen. I didn't think Lee's
                    wrath was directed at the bank but at the U.S. I thought after the furor calmed
                    down, it would be back to business as usual. Lee would give his views on world
                    affairs again to the CIA, to Agnew, to me - to anyone who would listen. Chase
                    Manhattan might lose its loan, but the paper would be closed and the whole
                    incident forgotten. The bank didn't suffer much otherwise except Singaporeans
                    were nervous about dealing with it for a while.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While you were ambassador, were you at all concerned by
                        CIA anits activities?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROSS: I thought the station had excellent relations with the police. But by the
                    time I arrived, their best agents had been transferred; the Agency was not using
                    Singapore as a regional base any longer.</p>
                <p>Q: I would like to return to Lee's views of Vietnam. What did he see as the
                    potential consequences of our withdrawal from there?</p>
                <pb facs="0082" n="Page0082"/>
                <p>CROSS: He was very much taken with the “domino” theory. He didn't think that the
                    Thais, or the Laos, or the Cambodians could resist the communists. He thought
                    the Thais in particular could well change sides in a hurry and align themselves
                    with the North Vietnamese and the Chinese. He didn't like the Malaysians and the
                    feeling was mutual; and he thought that they too would cave. He didn't see the
                    Indonesians as much of a bulwark. So he could easily foresee the whole of
                    Southeast Asia falling to the communists. But he thought that if it looked like
                    the U.S. would stay engaged, and if the South Vietnamese leaders remained in
                    office, and if the U.S. military didn't leave entirely, we would be seen as
                    having won the war. I go through this at greater length in my book.</p>
                <p>Michigan and Policy Planning</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you returned to the States in 1971, you were assigned

                </p>
                <p>CROSS: Yes, I went to Michigan. I think those assignments are usually hints that
                    the Department wants the officer to retire. In fact, I got a very good break
                    because it enabled me to get back into Chinese affairs. Michigan has one of the
                    top Chinese studies departments in the country. The staff received me warmly; I
                    taught two courses and lectured in others, but I spent considerable time with
                    the staff on guided reading. I hated going to Michigan under those
                    circumstances, but I really enjoyed it.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CROSS: No, I was given good support by personnel. I was told repeatedly that they
                    had good jobs for me. The good job they had in mind was in the Policy Planning
                    Staff, which really didn't appeal to me because my areas of interest were
                    already being covered and I would have had to work on other Asian areas with
                    which I was not very familiar. I started there, buI could not make much of a
                    contribution. I did prepare a few papers on Cambodia which recommended that we
                    work with Sihanouk to head off the communists.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0083" n="Page0083"/>
                <p>CROSS: I thought that it could be of very good use to the Seventh Floor. The
                    members of S/P are usually senior officers, with some outside experts mixed in.
                    They write papers based on very good information. They are supposed to be the
                    long-range planners. If used properly, and if a secretary of state is willing to
                    take the papers seriously - as was true in Kennan's days - then S/P could be a
                    most useful office. But in fact, a secretary is so bogged down in daily crises,
                    as are the NSC and the regional bureaus, that no one has time for long-range
                    planning. These organizations would talk to me anytime I wanted to, but they
                    would or could not pay much attention to S/P's output. I wrote only a few
                    papers, including one on China that didn't get very far - I supported the view
                    that Taiwan should not be encouraged to declare its independence, lest we get
                    involved in a crisis with the PRC which might include armed conflict. I thought
                    that was not worth the trouble since it would ruin our China policy. I don't
                    know what happened to that paper. But those few papers were the total of my
                    contribution to S/P while I was there.</p>
                <p>Q: You were in S/P when Kissinger was secretary of state and Winston Lord was the
                    head of the staff. Both of them made their reputations on our relationships with
                    the PRC. Were they at all interested in anyone's else views?</p>
                <p>CROSS: They certainly did not want to hear from me about China.Kissinger was
                    still also the NSC Advisor so that we had minimum impact.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How long were you in S/P?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROSS: About a year and a half. I was always looking for another assignment
                    because I considered S/P as a dead end. I thought the S/P concept was a good one
                    and I think, under different circumstances, I might even have enjoyed a tour
                    there. But I was not doing anything; so I wanted to go back overseas. The
                    grapevine kept reporting that Agnew's staff was blocking all possible
                    assignments for me. They apparently had told State personnel that I was not to
                    get another ambassadorship. The whole thing was a shock; I didn't believe that
                    Agnew could be so small-minded. In fact, I defended him for a while; I was kind
                    of ashamed for him not only because he was a representative of Greek-Americans,
                    but also because he looked like such an honest guy.</p>
                <p>One day, I was at the Omaha airport waiting for a flight to Washington and
                    watching one of the National League playoff games. The telecast was interrupted
                    to announce Agnew's resignation. So I thought my luck would now change.</p>
                <p>About two days after that event, I got a call from a senior official in the
                    Office of Personnel, wanting to know whether I would be interested in a Hong
                    Kong assignment as consul general.</p>
                <p>Hong Kong II</p>

                    <pb facs="0084" n="Page0084"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in Hong Kong from 1974 to 1977?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROSS: I was there three years and nine months. That was about as long as one
                    could hold on to that job, in light of the long list of others who wanted
                    it.</p>
                <p>Q: It must have been an interesting time since we had just opened relations with
                    Beijing. What was there to do in Hong Kong during this period?</p>
                <p>CROSS: We had a Liaison Office in Beijing, headed first by David Bruce and then
                    George Bush. At the beginning, they were highly restricted in their activities.
                    The Office was not allowed, for example, to get newspapers. They would sit at
                    dinner parties in Beijing with the PLO representative. They were not really
                    being as active as they might wish to have been. So we in Hong Kong still had
                    the main responsibility for “China watching.” We had some very good Chinese
                    language officers - Wever Gim and Don Anderson headed the section, for example -
                    and a great Chinese staff. Beijing did not have a local staff - or at least a
                    very small one - and all Chinese were PRC employees. Therefore, it was very
                    limited in what it could do.</p>
                <p>So we still had a major reporting requirement which covered all aspects of
                    Chinese life. We still had a lot of resources in Hong Kong, but over a period of
                    time, we began slowly to assist the Liaison Office as best we could. We had a
                    very good relationship; most of us were old friends.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was happening in China at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROSS: It was the “Gang of Four” time - for the first part of our time. The Gang
                    of Four and the residual effects of the Cultural Revolution created problems for
                    our Liaison Office. We interpreted this weird phenomenon of the Gang of Four as
                    symbolic of the last years of the Mao regime. We really had no idea of what was
                    happening within the Chinese leadership. Deng Xiaoping had emerged again and in
                    1974 (I think) was returning to a leadership role. Zhou En-lai died in January,
                    1976. By April, Deng had been dismissed again. That was followed by a hysterical
                    period in China. When Mao died in September 1976, the “Gang of Four” was
                    dismissed and Deng took over once again.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was our intelligence pretty good about all of these
                        events?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROSS: I don't think so. We based our analyses mostly on Chinese directives,
                    which were policy oriented. But Kissinger would always complain that we would
                    provide good reports on what had already been decided, but very little on how
                    and when it was decided or by whom for sure. That intelligence was only
                    developed as the Liaison Office expanded its contacts and then later when full
                    diplomatic relations were established and our embassy could get around.</p>
                <pb facs="0085" n="Page0085"/>
                <p>As for the “Gang of Four,” it was clear to us that they were hated,although the
                    depth of that hate did not become clear until later.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did we foresee a new day dawning?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROSS: There was no question that the “Gang of Four” were the worst of the Mao
                    period. We assumed that sooner or later that leadership would fall apart and
                    that one would come out on top. But as long as Mao was alive, the four had to
                    depend on each other - despite the fact that Mao by this time was senile.
                    Eventually, Hua Guofeng became the figurehead leader. In fact, he was such a
                    surprise that our political section did not recognize the name. He arrested the
                    “Gang of Four” after Mao's death. But Hua did not immediately have any base and
                    was soon replaced by Deng. But in the intervening time, Hua criticized the
                    Cultural Revolution and all of it excesses.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your relations with the Liaison Office were good?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROSS: Yes. We could hardly be seen as rivals. We were separated geographically
                    and as far as work was concerned, as I said before, the Liaison Office was
                    pretty well circumscribed. I don't think Kissinger really cared much about USLO;
                    he just wanted to be sure that some well known American name like Bush be there
                    so that he could fly out and talk to Zhou En-lai.</p>
                <p>Q: While you were in Hong Kong, we withdrew from Vietnam. How did that impact on
                    your work?</p>
                <p>CROSS: The fall of South Vietnam was a real blow to many Americans in Hong Kong.
                    Almost all of the American operations, private as well as public, employed a lot
                    of people. Our Hong Kong staff was loaded with people such as myself who had
                    worked in Vietnam. So our withdrawal was a real blow to the many who had been
                    involved at one time or another during their lives. The event didn't come as a
                    surprise. Ambassador Martin, traveling to and from Washington, used to stop in
                    Hong Kong. He kept reassuring us that all would be well, but there were lots of
                    other visitors from Vietnam who were involved in actual operations and who
                    painted a different picture. Just before we withdrew, we received a long list of
                    those people who were to be evacuated. The list was so long that it took the
                    machine two hours to run it off. We used to send stuff to Saigon until the
                    embassy asked us to stop; it couldn't even handle what it already had.</p>
                <pb facs="0086" n="Page0086"/>
                <p>On the day Saigon finally fell, I got many calls from American businessmen asking
                    whether I could get Mr. So and So (one of their friends) out. I told them that
                    we were not in communication with Saigon at all. They found that hard to believe
                    even though I told them that we were evacuating all Americans on that day. We
                    also immediately began to put the word out that regardless of what was happening
                    in Vietnam, the U.S. was in no way retreating from Asia and that we were going
                    to try to do what we could for our Vietnamese allies - several thousands had
                    been picked up at sea by one Danish ship. Ship after ship docked in Hong Kong
                    with these refugees on board. They landed in Hong Kong and then were sent by
                    plane to Guam. Shirley and I would go to the docks every evening to shake hands
                    with these refugees and sort of welcome them to the U.S.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the British authorities respond to this
                        deluge?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROSS: The governor had been the British ambassador in Vietnam, so he was very
                    sympathetic to these refugees. But the British insisted they had no facilities
                    to take care of the refugees and so they were very happy when we took them off
                    to Guam. The British eventually had to establish a huge refugee operation when
                    the “boat people” began to come.</p>
                <p>In closing, our job was to report on what was going in Hong Kong as well as on
                    the mainland. The governor and I would talk frequently; he would insist that the
                    major actors in Hong Kong were the Chinese and the Americans. He didn't mean
                    that the U.S. had any policy role in the governance of the colony, but that the
                    security of Hong Kong depended on our willingness to stay engaged in East Asia.
                    He also felt that if China had confidence in its future and if the U.S. tried to
                    help develop the country (e.g., by joint enterprises), that would reduce
                    pressure on Hong Kong. He used Korea and Japan as models of good U.S.
                    policy.</p>
                <p>Senior Foreign Service Inspector</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left Hong Kong in September 1977. Then what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROSS: I was Senior Foreign Service Inspector for approximately a year and half,
                    all in NEA. It was an ideal assignment because it was a period of great
                    turbulence for the U.S. and the Foreign Service; Iran, Bangladesh, Afghanistan
                    and Sri Lanka were all in the headlines. Add Camp David and the Iran hostage
                    situation and you can see it was a very active period for U.S. diplomacy. I
                    inspected Iran just before the first attack on the embassy in November. I also
                    inspected Afghanistan and was warned that a coup would some soon. I left a few
                    days before it actually happened. But I don't think this period of my career is
                    worth going into in any depth.</p>
                <p>Director of the American Institute in Taiwan</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0087" n="Page0087"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then in 1979, you were assigned to Taipei. How did that
                        come about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROSS: I stayed in Taipei until late 1981. While in the inspection corps, I was
                    writing a report on our operations in India. One day I was called to come to the
                    auditorium to attend a meeting with other senior officers. It was then that I
                    found out that we had arranged for full normalization of relations with the PRC
                    which automatically called for a termination of diplomatic relations with
                    Taiwan. There would be some unofficial relations with Taipei. After the meeting,
                    I was asked to go to speak to the editorial board of the Atlanta Constitution
                    and to a Rotary Club in Tampa. I was to go the very next day.</p>
                <p>That I did. While talking to both groups, I was impressed by how comfortable they
                    were with the concept of better relations with the PRC; I was also impressed by
                    how these groups insisted that we maintain good relations with Taiwan. Without
                    that, I could see that our overall China policy would be in great difficulties.
                    When I returned, I found that my two former DCMs from Hong Kong, Roger Sullivan
                    and David Dean, were going to organize the new institution that we were
                    establishing in Taipei and that David would become the “unofficial” president of
                    the American Institute here in Washington. I asked what they intended to do in
                    Taipei and was told that it would be as low key as possible. But they were
                    looking for a senior officer to head up whatever the institution would be and
                    they said they would be glad to put my name on a list if I wanted to do
                    that.</p>
                <p>I then was assigned to inspect the NEA Bureau in the Department. When that was
                    finished, I formally retired from the Service and joined the American Institute
                    in Taiwan as its first director. Of course, there was no difference in pay or FS
                    perks and the job had the same or, perhaps more, responsibilities as an
                    ambassador. That was very interesting and all of us in AIT felt we were engaged
                    in the difficult but essential work of keeping things going with Taiwan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What kind of vetting did you go through?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROSS: Dick Holbrooke was the assistant secretary for EA. Harriman had asked to
                    look at some papers, during which I had a chance to talk to Dick in his home in
                    Georgetown. He asked me what I was doing and I told him that I was interested in
                    the Taipei position. Harriman had been instrumental in getting Holbrooke the
                    Assistant Secretary job in the Department and Holbrooke was living with the
                    Harrimans, so that helped considerably, although I must say that I never did get
                    along with Holbrooke very well. He was worried that I was psychologically too
                    close to Taiwan. We never really clashed, but we did not have a close
                    relationship either. He did give the clearest instructions I have ever received;
                    he told me not to ask for anything because nothing could be done for the
                    institute. Deputy Secretary of State Christopher said roughly the same
                    thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0088" n="Page0088"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did any congressmen talk to you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROSS: Absolutely; Congress was after all the parent of the Taiwan Relations Act
                    over the opposition of the Department, which in some details reflected the PRC
                    view. The Department just wanted to sneak me over to Taipei and then we would
                    see what would happen. But in the negotiations with the PRC, we insisted that we
                    be permitted to sell “defensive” arms to Taiwan. That raised - and continues to
                    raise - some contentious issues. Then came the question of what we would do with
                    all the treaties that we had signed with Taiwan, which were numerous. For
                    example, we had the standard treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation. All
                    trade between the U.S. and Taiwan as well as U.S. investment on the island was
                    governed by that treaty. What would happen under the new circumstances?</p>
                <p>These questions and many more like them forced Congress to step in and it drafted
                    the Taiwan Relations Act [TRA]. I looked at the draft and saw that it would be
                    easy for us to operate under it. As I said, the Department was unhappy with the
                    TRA in general and about a statement at the beginning of the Act which
                    stipulated that the security of Taiwan was very important to the U.S. That was
                    the rationale for the arms sales. It also suggested that an attack on Taiwan
                    could be viewed as an attack on the U.S. It was a very strong statement that
                    raised objections from President Carter and the Department. But it was passed
                    anyway and the president signed it. So I talked to a lot of congressmen, many of
                    whom were unalterably opposed to normalization - for example Ed Derwinski, who
                    later joined the Department. Jesse Helms was also strongly opposed.</p>
                <p>I think we should recognize how good Congress was on this issue. There was a
                    fascinating inter-play between Congress and the academic community, for example,
                    that fought the Taiwan Relations Act tooth and nail. Most of the questions were
                    not about arms sales, but how the “unofficial” relations would look. That was
                    hard to explain to my colleagues in the Department and others; it was an unusual
                    arrangement that required considerable pioneering. All of the issues concerning
                    the role of the institute were worked out before I went to Taiwan.</p>
                <pb facs="0089" n="Page0089"/>
                <p>I should mention on the arms sales, with which I was deeply involved, that the
                    Department insisted that we not discuss arms sales in Taiwan. All negotiations
                    on those questions would take place in Washington even though DoD sent a couple
                    of first rate officers - retired - to Taipei. Washington was afraid that we
                    would make recommendations that might be embarrassing. I said that I thought
                    that restriction was unwarranted because it would predictably result in the
                    Taiwan representatives in the U.S. talking to the arms manufacturers, the
                    Congress and DoD, thereby generating lobbies that would really complicate the
                    Department's decision making process. I thought that we in Taipei would be much
                    freer to discuss the Taiwanese requests. We would take a vow of silence; we
                    would just listen and not comment; we would send our recommendations which would
                    not be difficult for Washington to deal with. In the process the Department was
                    establishing, the pressure groups would have been all over the Department before
                    we even had a chance to make our views known. But the restrictions on us were
                    maintained.</p>
                <p>The only real dispute we had with Washington was on the question of the follow-on
                    fighter. The Taiwanese had the F-5, which had been the standard export fighter
                    sold to many countries. They were not as capable as some of the more modern
                    fighter planes available by then, such as the F-16 or the F-4. So any follow-on
                    fighter that might be available had far greater capability than the F-5 which
                    had intentionally been built for export and which by then was already many years
                    old. The Taiwanese were partially, if not primarily, interested in a new fighter
                    for symbolic reasons. They knew that their air force could never be adequate to
                    match the PRC's in numbers; so their interest in requesting a new fighter was to
                    see what the U.S. would do after the PRC entered strong objections to the sale
                    as it certainly would. I strongly recommended that the discussions of a
                    follow-up fighter be terminated as soon as possible, before we found ourselves
                    in a major imbroglio with the PRC, the American plane manufacturers, Congress,
                    etc. The decision-making process dragged on and on. President Carter established
                    a new system which required the manufacturers themselves to develop an export
                    model of lower capability than the best U.S. aircraft. These could be sold to
                    countries like Taiwan who couldn't buy the most advanced model. However, Taiwan
                    would still have to have permission from the U.S. government to buy. Both the
                    Carter and the Reagan administrations dithered over their decision, with the PRC
                    fussing all the time.</p>
                <p>Our major task in Taiwan was to conduct all of the business of an embassy without
                    being one. We had to do a lot of little things that irritated the hell out of
                    the Chinese. Fortunately, I knew the Chinese well enough that I think we managed
                    to soften the impact of our Taiwan operation; I think, therefore, that our
                    operation became more acceptable than it might have been.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But weren't your operations difficult to undertake lest
                        they bviewed as part of “formal” relations?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0090" n="Page0090"/>
                <p>CROSS: They were. For example, the Taiwanese wanted to address me as “Mr.
                    Ambassador.” I told them that was not acceptable; I might have been one once
                    upon a time but was so no more. Then they tried to treat us socially as they
                    would have any diplomatic mission - there were a few still left; so after a
                    while we just didn't attend such things as national days unless other private
                    Americans were also invited.</p>
                <p>Our operations in Taipei had to be conducted with great skill and caution; much
                    of the business was conducted indirectly. I had a couple of contacts which I
                    used periodically for that process. One was Fred Chien, who was a vice foreign
                    minister; he really became the U.S. desk officer. He could be difficult, but I
                    accepted him for what he was, a hard working diplomat. I also worked closely
                    with the advisor to the president, Admiral Ma Chi-chuang. I wasn't allowed to
                    meet President Chiang. I deliberately did not seek any relationship with him. So
                    we never met, even secretly, even though that might have been useful. But
                    sometimes I met Admiral Ma one-on-one to discuss specific issues, such as the
                    Institute's role in Taiwan's human rights - the KMT security services was
                    beating up on the Taiwanese again. I knew that our view would be accurately
                    conveyed to President Chiang. AIT kept plugging away at these issues, all behind
                    the scene. We kept making the point that the regime didn't need to worry about
                    the oppositionists; its reputation around the world was much more important. I
                    think that our quiet approach did have a beneficial impact on the Taiwanese
                    government's action on human rights in the end.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we trying to discourage any movement, if there was
                        one, foTaiwan independence?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROSS: The KMT of course was pushing against that. There was nothinsubtle about
                    their goals; they were right up front against independence.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any noticeable difference in Chiang Ching-kuo
                        over timon this issue?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROSS: The only hints I saw really came after I left. While I was there, there
                    was no public diminution of the KMT stated desire to return to the mainland or
                    against independence. One person I knew well - a former Foreign Minister and
                    later Secretary General of the KMT - spoke in terms of enough time having passed
                    and that Taiwan should now move towards democracy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any particular problems with Washington's
                        generadesire to expand contacts with the PRC?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0091" n="Page0091"/>
                <p>CROSS: I had endless problems with the people in charge of U.S.-PRC relations
                    mainly because I think they viewed me as a strong proponent of Taiwan. In fact,
                    I was really downplaying the issue. The main proponents of closer ties with the
                    PRC were on the Desk and in the NSC. I wrote policy papers suggesting that we
                    could not expand relations with the PRC beyond a certain point without giving
                    Taiwan some assurance that their future was safe. One way of doing that was to
                    make the advance fighter available. But Washington was continually concerned
                    that the signing of an agreement for the sale of the advanced fighter - which,
                    by the way, was not yet built - would be viewed by Beijing as a sign that we no
                    longer believed that the two parts of China could be peacefully reunited. I felt
                    that the some people in the Department had the view that the PRC thought that
                    U.S. arms sales to Taiwan was the main reason why unification was not
                    happening.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I guess Taiwan was really an embarrassment to the
                        administration.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROSS: Nixon's policy was quite clear. Taiwan was to be tolerated but would not
                    be allowed interfere with the improvement of relations with the PRC. I think we
                    could have handled the situation much better with both the PRC and the Congress,
                    not to mention Taiwan itself. In fact, the Carter administration would often be
                    viewed as being a hand-maiden of the PRC and doing its bidding. That really
                    frustrated Congress.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have many congressional visitors?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROSS: Indeed, and they all praised Taiwan for its stance. Of course, the Taiwan
                    leadership had no equal in the world on how to milk these congressional visits.
                    I think almost all of the visitors came with open minds. For example, John Glenn
                    wasn't sold on Taiwan. He and Mansfield were leaders in the Senate pushing for
                    improved relations with the PRC all along. When they would come through Hong
                    Kong, I would discuss the situation with them. I also thought that we should
                    have better relations with the PRC; that was one of the reasons why I took the
                    Taiwan assignment. I wanted to help improve the U.S.-PRC relations, but I always
                    ran into suspicions about my sympathies.</p>
                <p>Q: I think you have illustrated one of the problems of our foreign policy. At the
                    second or third level in Washington, you often see people who think they can
                    manipulate the policy and the outcomes and want to show their power. I am sure
                    that the China desk found Taiwan an embarrassment which barred them from doing
                    whatever they wanted with the PRC.</p>
                <p>CROSS: Not only that, but the PRC was constantly telling us that we couldn't have
                    anything that could be interpreted as diplomatic relations with Taiwan. Taiwan
                    had a consulate general in Dallas and the PRC objected to including the names of
                    the staff members in the official consular list. So the PRC was always on our
                    backs trying to undermine our relations with Taiwan.</p>
                <pb facs="0092" n="Page0092"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get much pressure from that part of the
                        Chinese-Americacommunity that supported Taiwan?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROSS: The Chinese-American community has supported Taiwan for such a long time
                    that there is bound to be a close affiliation. But I must say that the
                    Chinese-Americans were delighted with the opening to the mainland. They also
                    supported American policy to preserve Taiwan. Most of them didn't speak Mandarin
                    in any case, so communications with the mainland would have been difficult.</p>
                <p>I should tell you one story which is very important. During all of the debates
                    about the fighter aircraft, in the spring of 1978, I came back to Washington -
                    at my own request - to talk to Secretary Haig. I wanted to talk to him because
                    it was obvious to me that some people in the Department were willing to proceed
                    with the sale of arms to the PRC on the assumption that then sales to Taiwan
                    would be easier. I thought it was a terrible strategy. I am not sure that Haig
                    was familiar with this ploy, but he did want to reduce the number of fighter
                    aircraft that were to be sold to Taiwan. I thought that the American Institute
                    people in Washington were very good, but I doubted that they had access to the
                    leadership of the Department.</p>
                <p>So I came back and had long discussions with John Holdridge, the assistant
                    secretary for EA. We were good friends, having served together in Hong Kong.
                    John told me very clearly that nothing at that point in time would stand in the
                    way of the Cold War; that is to say, our relations with the PRC had always to be
                    seen in the context of our competition with the Soviet Union. That clear message
                    worried me even more; it did not portend well for U.S.-Taiwan relations. But
                    there was nothing I could do about the facts of life. But one day, I was invited
                    by Fred Chien and James Soong, who was then head of the Information Office and
                    later a candidate for president. This was a family affair to take place at a
                    resort on the coast; so Shirley and I went. We had a very nice time. On the last
                    evening, after we had finished the social events, the two Chinese took me off
                    into a private room where they told me that President Chiang wanted me to give a
                    message to President Reagan. The essence of the message was that Chiang would
                    not make any waves about the putative arms sales.</p>
                <p>I asked why. I was told that Chiang had a personal message from Reagan which was
                    the go-ahead for a Taiwan purchase of the advance fighter. I then asked what
                    type plane was being considered. I was told that it would be a model adequate to
                    Taiwan's defense needs, meaning the FX. It seemed to me that this strategy had
                    been a very good one for the U.S.; it was putting the Taiwan issue on the
                    back-burner. I called my deputy, Stan Brooks, and a couple of other staff
                    members and told them that we had succeeded in our mission; Taiwan was going to
                    get an advanced fighter which should give them a sense that the U.S. was
                    supporting them. I thought that then my job was done and I could return to the
                    States.</p>
                <pb facs="0093" n="Page0093"/>
                <p>So I left; a few months later, the Department turned down the request for sale of
                    the advanced fighter for Taiwan. This was Holdridge's recommendation; he thought
                    that the PRC might raise serious objections. In fact, as soon as we turned down
                    the fighter, the PRC called in our representatives and told them that it would
                    object to any arms sales to Taiwan. They threatened to withdraw their ambassador
                    from Washington if the U.S. didn't agree to stop arms sales. That pressure
                    finally resulted in the Taiwan communique of August 1982 which stipulated that
                    we would not increase either quantitatively or qualitatively our arms sales to
                    Taiwan. That was completely cynical because within two years, we upgraded our
                    arms sales and then during the Bush administration, we sold F-16s to Taiwan. I
                    still think that had we sold the advanced aircraft in 1979, when I went to
                    Taiwan, we would have saved ourselves a lot of trouble because it would have
                    closed an open wound between us and the PRC. At the same time, we could have
                    restrained Taiwan from making some of its extreme comments because it knew that
                    this aircraft would be delivered whenever it came off the assembly line. (See
                    Born a Foreigner, pp. 263-270, on arms sales and dealing with the Taiwan issue
                    generally)</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left in the Fall of 1981. You retired then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROSS: I had already technically retired when I became director of AIT in Taipei
                    and I was also at the then retirement age. I was asked whether I would take a
                    political job, where the age issue would not be a factor. But I didn't think
                    there would be any post available for me that would equal any of the ones I had.
                    So I retired and went sight unseen to teach at the University of Washington in
                    Seattle.</p>
