                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We are in Caguas, Puerto Rico with Mike Norton. It's the
                        6th of September 2007. And we're going to talk about Mike Norton from zero
                        until the present time. Mike, tell me first of all in one paragraph just the
                        broad outlines of where you were, what you did, and we'll go into the
                        details later. You were born where? You went where to school? Let's get it
                        in a tiny capsule and then we'll go back and cover it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORTON: Okay, my biosynopsis. I was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota in May 1942. I
                    suppose it was a lovely spring because in those days before climate change had
                    become an issue springs were lovely in Minnesota. I was born into a working
                    class, Jewish family. I went to school. When I wasn't in their school, I was
                    learning Hebrew at Hebrew School. I went on to college. I began work, actually,
                    at 13 sweeping the floor of a cleaner's and unloading trucks for a number of
                    years and went on to college.</p>
                <p>I went to a small college in St. Paul, one of the Twin Cities, called Hamline
                    University. And then I went on for a brief period to post-graduate study at
                    University of Chicago. I didn't last there very long. I found it horribly
                    snobbish. Maybe it was the ghost of its benefactor and the Gothic atmosphere; it
                    also may have been because I felt that it was more important to follow a woman
                    than to pursue my studies. I then went to the University of Minnesota for an MA
                    in Philosophy and English and American Literature. And concluded my studies,
                    that is to say my evasion of the draft, in 1969 at the University of Wisconsin.
                    I had a candidacy for the doctorate in American Literature. I then left for the
                    great beyond.</p>
                <p>I spent some time in Ireland. Then I went on to Paris, France, and other
                    adventures followed. I met a wonderful woman who was one of Haiti's most
                    glorious artists. And, in her attempt to get back to her native land, we left
                    Paris in 1979 and went first to Martiniquspent four or five years therthen went
                    to live in the Dominican Republic. And then when Duvalier fell, Jean-Claude
                    Duvalier fell, in 1986, we crossed the border. Actually, we were flown in a
                    private plane. The pilot was the same pilot who was with Aristide when Aristide
                    was ousted.</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>And then I went to work in Haiti. I scrounged a while looking for a job - very,
                    very difficult to find a job. And then I got into, I did some teaching. I had
                    taught English as a foreign language for a number of years and then I went into
                    radio and I became a journalist. I had my own prografirst at night, a program of
                    commentary. I commented on the eventthe extraordinary political revolution in
                    Haiti. And then I began a Sunday night interview program with the luminaries of
                    Haitartists, politicians, intellectualin French and Creole.</p>
                <p>I did that until the state of siege in 1988 of General Prosper Avril. And, since
                    my good friend, Antoine Izmery was banished—he was later killed during
                    Aristide's exile by military thugs—since he was my sponsor, I stopped. I stopped
                    regretfully since radio was my true love. And then I dedicated myself entirely
                    to reporting for The Associated Press from 1988 until 2004. And simultaneously I
                    was a sort of pundit/performer for the BBC on the subject of Haiti. I had a
                    lovely experience with the BBC. I was free to give my opinions and arguments. I
                    also, during the coup d'�tat, did free commentaries and analysis in Creole for a
                    community radio in Montreal for the Haitian community... Things like that:
                    believing at all times that if people could get to know the truth, right action
                    would follow.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A unique trajectory. Thank you for the thumbnail. Every
                        bit of it must be expanded greatly. Let's go in order. Let's go back to the
                        beginning in Minneapolis. What was Minneapolis to you, and how did you see
                        it in your development as part of the larger world?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORTON: I was a young Jewish boy in Minnesota. You have to understand what
                    Minnesota was to me. Again, it's my Minnesota. What did it mean to be in
                    Minnesota? What was Minnesota? Within a radius of ten blocks, three separate
                    English accents could be heard. The accents of the African Americans whose
                    fathers and mothers had probably migrated from the south after the Second World
                    War. We're now talking about the 1940's as I was born in 1942. The accent of the
                    sons of native-born Minnesotans, and then the accents of the sons and daughters
                    of immigrants like myself. My accent, although you can probably hear something
                    of Minnesota in it, was largely shaped by national broadcast newEdward R. Murrow
                    and all those other people that my father listened assiduously to. So three
                    different accents.</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>It was, now looking back on it, rather curious. At the time it seemed natural.
                    But you integrate the unnatural and it functions naturally in your system
                    whether you're conscious of it or not. Minnesota, to me, was the backyard of the
                    house I was born in. It was the elm tree. It was the fresh-smelling grass. It
                    was the bleeding hearts my father planted in the garden. I was in wonder that
                    the ground could put forth such things. It was the aerial I strung from my
                    bedroom to the garage. That was stolen by a neighborhood kid. Hostility: theme
                    of my first youth. That led from the garage to my hiding under my sheets
                    listening to the Voice of America and Willis Conover. And, above my head, the
                    walls plastered with the faces of the great jazz musicians I adored: Satchmo, of
                    course, and Johnny Hodges, Art Tatum, Dizzy Gillespie, Charlie Parker... Charlie
                    Parker died in 1955. I never really got to see him in any of the concerts I
                    tried to attend. My parents were not racist but they were somewhat taken aback
                    by all of those black faces looking at them from my bedroom wall. I was attached
                    to that back yard, to that elm tree, to the beasties I found there and to the
                    smell of the earth in spring. And then when we moved, that became
                    detachment.</p>
                <p>I really didn't know where I was. There was a Jewish tradition which, as we will
                    discuss, was extremely important to us. We were orthodox Jews because we were
                    poor. As my parents went up the social laddemy father was an office worker, he
                    became an office worker with a slightly larger salarthey became conservative.
                    They never got wealthy enough to become Reform Jews, but it was completely
                    class-oriented and turned me off. I didn't understand then two things: what the
                    American way of life was that I was taught again and again at school, and what
                    the Jewish tradition was. For me, American Judaism was Unitarianism with
                    dreidels. I didn't want to play and I didn't understand anything about the
                    anti-Semitism. I mentioned hostility was rife in the neighborhood. Looking back
                    on it, thinking of the son of an Italian immigrant, the son of German Minnesotan
                    stock, “dirty Jew, dirty Jew,” every day. That still rings in my ears.</p>
                <p>That was Minnesota for me. The nature was splendid. I loved it, I loved it. At
                    that time there were no suburbs. There was a city and there was the country, so
                    my older brother and I went fishing. And we caught snakes and we caught frogs.
                    And we let them go in our neighbor's yard to frighten the not-very-friendly
                    Jewish neighbor. So that was Minnesota to me. No man's land. When we left, I was
                    about thirteen, to move a couple blocks away which was into another world, and
                    it just lost its hold on me. The American way of life I just didn't understand,
                    yet they kept on harping on it. Don't forget this is the '50's; this is
                    Minnesotmore liberal than many parts of the United Statebut this is McCarthyism.
                    The relation that my family from Europe had with the left in Europone uncle of
                    mine was a member of the Bundwas completely, completely covered. I had no clue
                    that I was working class. My two grandfathers were both factory workers. My
                    father was a simple office worker. Some things were unexpressed and I had no
                    idea that they were unexpressed. I was sold what I always felt to be a bill of
                    goods.</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>The American way of life was what? The hotdogs I couldn't eat because they
                    weren't kosher? The awfuat that time television wasn't so bad but I was a child
                    with a radio, I loved the radithe awful television programs, the
                    commercials...it was just beginning something that has now been developed into
                    America as Disneyland. It wasn't quite that at that time, but I didn't like it.
                    It turned me off. I knew there was something else there. I didn't understand
                    that it was, for example, the Jewish tradition. I don't mean the religious
                    tradition; I mean the cultural tradition. I mean the wealth and wisdom of the
                    Talmud, the extraordinary mythical power of the Tanach. I didn't know anything
                    about that. I felt it. I knew it was there. It had been transmitted to me, and I
                    knew that somehow four thousand years of Jewish tradition weighed a little more
                    heavily than Dick Clark. I liked jazz, so I didn't like rock and roll. I liked
                    the other that I was and didn't know I was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You say you were the son of immigrants. Is it your parents
                        who immigrated or your grandparents?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORTON: My parents immigrated. My mother was six; my father was nine. Both of my
                    grandfathers left Polanone from Lithuania, one from Galicito the United States
                    in probably 1914. And along came the war. They had planned, of course, to bring
                    the family over. But along came the war and they were without news from their
                    families from 1915 to 1918. They completely lost contact with their families.
                    And so it was a great reunion in the 1920's when they reunited. And I think that
                    they were friends, so they both reunited in Minneapolis. Jews went to New York,
                    they went to Cleveland, they went to Chicago...and then, like the Mafia,
                    sometimes they went to Minneapolis when things got hot farther east. And that's
                    where I grew up, in Minneapolis.</p>
                <p>I must say that if my family history had been different I would never have left
                    Minneapolis. I think I would have traveled, but I would have come back because
                    no place in the world is as beautiful as Minneapolis. The lakes, the
                    people...friendly kinds of people I like, the cultural environment, the
                    weather...the cold in the winter, the heat in the summer, Loring Park... I used
                    to go down to Loring Park and look at the muskrats. They're fascinating.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before we leave the topic, your parents came as small
                        children. Tell me a little something about your grandparents.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>NORTON: My paternal grandfather, I never knew. I saw one picture of him; he was
                    white-haired. He was fifty-two. He worked himself to a heart attack, obviously.
                    People worked their asses off at that time. They worked. They really worked. I
                    don't know if it was a work ethic. I think it may have been to the crack of the
                    whip that they worked. And he worked himself dead. I never knew him. As a matter
                    of fact, my father, who was quite intelligencame to the United States at nine
                    and graduated high school at sixteen, so he mastered the language in that short
                    period of time and the subjects at sixteen and he graduated at sixteen and had
                    to go to work to support his familthat's why he didn't become middle middle
                    class. He was lower middle class, as we say. I lived in a lower middle class
                    neighborhood. That's hopeful, as in that you're not working class. You're in the
                    lower middle class. It's just a question of time before you rise on the ladder,
                    so he went to work and he took care of his family.</p>
                <p>My maternal grandfather was a factory worker, as was my paternal grandfather. He
                    spoke no English really. My paternal grandmother had been a waitress in a Warsaw
                    restaurant. My maternal grandmother never spoke a word of English so far as I
                    know, and I think was traumatized because she never went out. Her daughters did
                    shopping for her. I only saw her outside of the house on the High Holy Days. I
                    don't know how she was transported from home. Did she walk? Was she teleported?
                    Anyway, I think she was terrified of America. She stayed home and cooked and,
                    when I came over, she smiled and rumpled my hair and gave me some gelt and no
                    other contact. They were the old country. They were strange transplanted
                    flowers. And yet, I must say, although there was no commonplace communication
                    between us, there was something more real about them than my teachers or even my
                    schoolmates.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A couple of things: So your father was a father at the age
                        of sixteen?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORTON: No, no. My father had to become the breadwinner for the family at
                    sixteen.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ah, the extended family...</hi>

                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>NORTON: Well, it happened to many people. The Jewish community, unlike I think
                    other immigrant communities, didn't want to have anything to do with the old
                    country. Many of them, of course, turned toward Palestine. My father did, too.
                    My father was a Zionist, but a left-wing Zionist. But they didn't want to
                    remember. They were bad memoriebad memories that became atrocious memories when
                    the Shoah occurred. I remember survivors of the Shoah turning up in our
                    community. A friend of my mother's, I remember this woman. This nervous woman
                    with very thin hair who had saved her husband from death in Auschwitz. I
                    remember the look on their faces. I remember a little boy. I remember some of
                    them trickled into our community. The question was...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The use of Yiddish...your grandmother...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORTON: Yah and so my parents, although they didn't want us to speak it and they
                    didn't want us to learn it. We were American Jews, although I later said I was
                    not a Jew of American origin, I was an American of Jewish origin. They spoke
                    Yiddish when they didn't want us to understand, and, of course, they so often
                    didn't want us to understand that finally we understood. I had two brothers. I
                    understood, I think, more than my brothers because I was the middle child and I
                    had a special relationship, I believe, with my mother. And I was always kind of
                    vigilant. One never knew when the storm would break. So I was always listening.
                    I couldn't speak it but I understood it. And then I was learning Hebrew. And
                    then I learned German. And then all of that. Those three languages I've lost,
                    I've forgotten, by the way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In your first ten years, was it mostly English?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORTON: It was English. It was exclusively English but, again, it was in a Jewish
                    home that, gradually (as my father made a little more money, still in the lower
                    middle class but I think he attained the middle middle class), became more and
                    more Jewish style rather than Jewish. My mother kept kosher at home, but we
                    didn't keep kosher outside. It was all very confusing. I didn't understand how
                    you could divide up supposedly divine commandments between inside and outside. I
                    didn't like that sort of stuff. I didn't, I think, ever really believe in the
                    divineness of the commandments, but I did believe in coherency and consistency.
                    And I didn't find that in my family or in the surrounding environment. I only
                    gradually understood the American way of life. Again, after my fashion. It
                    wasn't what I was given at school. It wasn't everybody obligated to go to pep
                    hour. Everybody would “Rah, rah, rah!” the high school football team and all
                    that. It was awful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Pep hour it was called?</hi>

                <p>NORTON: Something like that. It was an hour. Two of my friends and I finally said
                    no, and we didn't go. They allowed us to be different—that was a deep lesson in
                    the American way of life. The three of us had study hall. We were all alone, and
                    the rest of the school was shouting, you know, “Rah, rah, rah!” for North High,
                    and I didn't understand that. I didn't like the competitiveness. I didn't like
                    the violence. Look at a football game, it's even worse. Holy Moses, how can they
                    attack that football player for violence. With the dog fighting, Mike Vie, is
                    that his name?</p>

                </p>
                <p>NORTON: Mike Vick. I mean, hey man, sure it's illegal, but why isn't football
                    illegal? Why isn't boxing illegal? Why is violence legal in some cases and not
                    in others? Because of what community you belong to? Cock fighting where I am
                    right now is legal. Why is it legal? Why is bull fighting legal? Why don't
                    people get up in arms about bull fighting? Holy Cow, as Phil Rizzuto would
                    say.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So many things to go into. You mentioned the hostility
                        that you felt as a child and later you mentioned the friendliness.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORTON: Well, the truth of a society is in its children. The prejudices of the
                    parents are expressed by the children. I was a child. I got it double-barreled
                    like all the other Jewish kids, I suppose. At least in my neighborhood,
                    anti-Semitism was rife. Jesus was on the Cross. Who was Jesus? A boxer who lost
                    a championship match. He was all hung up on the ropes. The Catholics learned how
                    to box, and they boxed us. The neighborhood kids threw rocks at us. Why? I don't
                    know. Because we're dirty Jews. We're just dirty Jews. That expressed itself
                    whenever people knew I was a Jew. I was a child. Later on, either because times
                    had changed or because adults hold their tongues, the friendliness - the
                    hospitality of these people - was more apparent. At that time, we never locked
                    our doors.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you say later, later as you matured...</hi>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>NORTON: It might be, but also there was a race problem. Mine was minor. The race
                    problem was basically between the whites and the blacks. It was a small black
                    community, but ultimately, the black community was so desperatit must have been
                    in the '60's, I was no longer therthat they burned down the nearby main street
                    of my neighborhood. They were poor. They were really poor. And they spoke
                    different and they acted different. But they gave birth to jazz. Lester Young
                    and his family lived in Minneapolis when he was a teenager. It was a small and,
                    at times, explosive black community.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, let's get a painful thing on the record. The
                        hostility: do you think it was general? You mentioned Catholics becoming
                        fighters. Was it everybody else or were there certain ethnic groups?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORTON: No, well the Catholics didn't like us. I mean they had skills we didn't
                    have. They knew how to box. The blacks at the end of junior high basically the
                    blacks would pick on us. There was an article that Norman Podhoretz, of infamous
                    memory, wrote way back when when I was actually a subscriber to Commentarearly
                    '60'something about “My black problem.” And the situation's pretty well
                    described. Again, it's a child's view of the world. You later learn why, you
                    understand why, but basically I was a member of the oppressed in junior high and
                    the blacks were a member of the oppressive class. They were tough. They were
                    bitter. They were brutal. And they were lost. I had a glimmer of that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Wouldn't it be logical for two oppressed groups to combine
                        forces against the oppressors?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORTON: Well, didn't it happen when there was the Civil Rights movement? We were
                    kids, and there was no consciousness. Coming out of McCarthyism, I tell you,
                    there was no consciousness of anything. I didn't know I was working class. I
                    didn't know really the history of the Jews, the immigration. I didn't know the
                    history of the United States. I didn't know what made America that unusual, not
                    completely unique, thing we call a democratic empire, an imperial democracy. I
                    didn't understand manifest destiny. I lived it because I dreamed of hitting the
                    road. Most of my friends went either easthe more intellectual oneor westhe more
                    surf-oriented, culturally marginal onewent west. I went across the ocean. It
                    wasn't far enough for me across the ocean. If I could have gone to the moon I
                    would have gone to the moon. Not to get away only from the bad memory of the
                    draft and the ill-digested knowledge I did acquire finally about America's role
                    in the world, but also and especially my family. It was a very turbulent family,
                    a maelstrom, and there was no way out of it. I measured my strength and I found
                    myself wanting. And I thought that the better part of valor would be to flee and
                    I did. I understood it in my own way, of course. The most important sentence in
                    my life was the first sentence I learned in Hebrew School. We didn't begin with
                    B'reishit, with creation; we began with God speaking to Abraham. Lech l'cha, go.
                    Go. And that resonated in my mind as the possibility for me of something
                    glorious. Strange, isn't it?</p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>It means, “go,” in Hebrew. Lech l'cha. I remember those words. I remember the
                    version of the Tanach that we were reading from. I must have been eight. Was I
                    eight? Maybe even younger. Lech l'cha. And I went. And I went.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sorry, the Tanach is what? Is it the Pentateuch?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORTON: It's that and everything else. It's the Jewish Bible.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm going to ask you in a moment about your concept of the

                        This is part of your intellectual development. Before we get there, let's
                        get as much as we can from your origins. The men in your family worked very
                        hard, you said. By coercion more than by inspiration, I think you were

                </p>
                <p>NORTON: I think my grandparents. My father, no. My father was a true believer,
                    and, of course, he was paid as all true believers are paid, by being
                    shafted.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: True believer in what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORTON: Work. And doing a good job. And making the boss happy.</p>

                </p>
                <p>NORTON: No, no, no. He was a bookkeeper, an office worker.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I thought that was his later situation.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORTON: No, no. He was always a bookkeeper.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay. Why was he shafted? Just by having the
                        ceiling...?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>NORTON: I think that there was a ceiling on his pay. I noticed, I don't know the
                    details, a certain bitterness. He came to realize he was not appreciated, he was
                    expendable. He would take work home on Saturdays. He worked, he worked, he
                    worked. He was always busy puttering in the yard or puttering in the basement.
                    He finally got into the stock market. He kind of became one of these people's
                    investors. It disappointed me, of course It may have been at the same time that
                    he committed the unpardonable sin and he shifted from the Democratic Party to
                    the Republican Party. I don't know, was it when McGovern ran, at one moment he
                    voted Republican. That's another subject and worthy of analysis. Why this...he
                    prided himself on being the Average Joe. His name was Joe, by the way. He prided
                    himself on being the Average Joe. I don't know why the Average Joes vote against
                    their interests, but my Average Joe father was not ambitious. He was honest. I
                    admired him for that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why did it disappoint you that he went toward the stock
                        market?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORTON: Because it meant greater integration. He liked the game of it. He didn't
                    invest very much money. By that time already I was anti-capitalist in my
                    outlook. There's nothing that attaches us more to a system than the pleasure we
                    derive from it. And he was obviously deriving pleasure from it. That he didn't
                    connect it with the bitterness of his work experience where the nitty-gritty
                    was, after all, exploitation, that was his affair. Again, I assume he didn't. I
                    don't know. My father did not talk. I can tell you, do you want me to tell you,
                    the one conversation I had with my father?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORTON: I'm getting into the '20's now, my brother got married. He wasn't happily
                    married and my parents, being skinflints, never supported this talented young
                    man. He was so talented. I learned so much from him. I learned more from him
                    than from anybody. I worshipped him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: His name?</hi>

                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>NORTON: Leslie. He would take me on hikes and he would force me to collect stones
                    and rocks. We'd hunt snakes. I didn't want to and he forced me to, and I
                    learned. He had the sharpest eyes. He'd look up into the tree and see a cecropia
                    moth. He could...he was wonderful and he kept animals and he...was wonderful.
                    And he had a collection of trilobites. And he wanted to learn taxidermy. He
                    would have been a marvelous biology teacher, but my parents wouldn't help him.
                    He had to work. He had greater problems with my parents than I did. That is why
                    he never moved away. I had lesser problems than he, and so I was able to escape
                    their enchantment. And so my brother was sick. He went to the hospital. Why was
                    my brother sick? He wasn't sick. He was pooped. What did we say at that time? We
                    didn't say depression or anything like that. That came later. I don't know. Not
                    nervous breakdown. That was too...I don't know. Whatever it was at the time, he
                    had it. He couldn't take it anymore. I talked to my father and I said, “Hey,
                    Dad. Surely in life there is more than a house, a collection of opera records, a
                    job, and a kid. Surely.” And my father said, “What?” And shame of shames, I
                    couldn't answer him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you think you could answer him now?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORTON: Oh, of course I could. Look at my life. Dan, I hope you have a good life,
                    but now, at the end of mine, I can say I knew glory face to face. And, of the
                    many women I have known, I have known the most wonderful. And I have spilled my
                    guts on the planet.</p>
                <p>My father was repressed. My father didn't sneeze. My father held his sneezes in.
                    My mother was quite the opposite. She held nothing in. But since the only thing
                    that came out was her misery, poor thing, I think she was traumatized by the
                    wathe First World War. By lack of affection. She just didn't have what it took
                    to be happy. And so, between the two of them, Scylla and Charybdis, I decided
                    the best part was to wend my way. Odysseus, by the way, since I'm talking about
                    Scylla and Charybdis, The Odyssey is my favorite book. The Odyssey is not
                    particularly Jewish in spirit, is it? But Odysseus is the most Jewish of the
                    Greeks. I love Odysseus. I love Ulysses.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So did Odysseus take the next step home to heart?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORTON: Ah, of course.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What else about Odysseus appeals to you?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>NORTON: The capacity to extricate himself from predicaments. The wisdom. The
                    courage. The valor. And the intelligence. Great values: intelligence and
                    courage. Persistence. Never ever forget. Never ever give up. Twist and turn if
                    you have to, but never lose sight of the goal. The goal is not straight ahead
                    but it's there. And it's internally straight ahead, not externally. Ulysses was
                    not compassionate. But he was able to live a double life and Lord knows I have
                    lived onmany double lives. Many double lives, I've lived.</p>
                <p>What is my name? Michael Norton is the name that this interview will go under
                    because I was a reporter for eighteen years and I wrote under the name Michael
                    Norton. I gave interviews under that name. But my name is really Michael Norton
                    Blustein. And Blustein comes from where? Eighteenth century. The Austrian empire
                    forced us Jews in Galicia to take a family name. That's why we have Blustein,
                    Goodman, Goldmaall of these treacly romantic, sentimental names—Rosenblum. I
                    mean, I understood Malcolm X. I understood Malcolm X. I hated my family name. My
                    real, if I may say, my real name is Nissan Maher ben Joseph. That's my name.
                    That's the name I would have had if the Austrian empire hadn't emasculated so
                    many of us Jews. “Michael Norton” comes from the habit of the Jews to name their
                    children after dead ancestors, and to use the initials to find an American
                    equivalent. I became Michael Norton without the “Blustein” when I was in Haiti,
                    and thereafter whenever I wrote anything journalistic. So I've had a number of
                    lives. Who am I really? I don't know. I guess I'm Michael Norton Blustein after
                    all.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Again, before proceeding...we've talked about the men in
                        your family. The two grandfathers, the father. The mother was a bit
                        bewildered by her situation. Anything else to say about the women whom you
                        knew as family members?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORTON: My mother was very disappointed that I was not a girl. She had three
                    sons. I was the second. She gave up, I think, and accepted her terrible destiny.
                    Thank God she never had a daughter. And so it was, I later learned by chance,
                    that my aunt, my favorite aunt, in fact took me home with her. And I stayed with
                    her for the first weekJulia, a wonderful woman. The most intelligent of these
                    peasant women. My father who was a factory work, paternal grandfather, left the
                    children in the countryside, and they were basically peasants. They had a
                    relative who had some kind of corn mill or sawmill or something like that, and
                    Julia lived in Milwaukee, so we didn't see much of her. So whenever she kissed
                    me, she left a big red mark on my cheek. But I loved her because she was so
                    smart, and she was the only one that took an interest in our family tree. Roots,
                    you know. Through her, I learned that we had one survivor from our family from
                    the Shoaa maternal great aunt in Bielorusi is what we called it. What's it
                    called now?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Belarus.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>NORTON: Belarus. And also the story of the destruction of my mother's native town
                    in the First World War. It was no man's land between the Russians and the
                    Germans and they strung up the inhabitants of this town upside down and they
                    burned them alive and then they burned the town down. I never could get the name
                    of my mother's hometown straight. It was a small village, and they razed it. The
                    Germans did. But it could have been the Russians after all. Mirror image,
                    right?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Scylla and Charybdis.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORTON: Again, Scylla and Charybdis. She was a light, a very faint light, because
                    kids miss so much. At least I missed so much as a child. I was dreaming. I had
                    to get out. And having to get out, I missed so much. I missed so much of
                    interest in Minneapolis. Of things that were going on. Of the people. I was more
                    interested in looking up and away than looking around attentively. I learned
                    that later. What could I have done? I was extremely, extremely unhappy there,
                    and only gradually, when the distance and the years enabled me to, did I start
                    looking around and at and much less away and up. The discovery of history helped
                    me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As we go forward chronologically, let's get out of
                        chronology just for a moment. Once you left, we're going to take you to
                        Ireland and France and University of Wisconsin or Minnesota. How did you
                        remain in touch with your family, if you did?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORTON: I didn't.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You didn't.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORTON: I didn't. Occasionally I sent a note to my mother saying, “My mother, you
                    know it's not that I disown you. You can't disown your mother.” The reason why I
                    finally...that was the last straw in our relationship. It's complicated. My
                    mom's behavior toward my first wife was so intolerable, so crazy. She was so
                    lunatic that I just said hell, I can't do this anymore.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So your mother, your father, your brothers... Your father
                        lived until what year?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORTON: I don't know.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yeah, okay. You had two brothers...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORTON: ...My father died in 1982.</p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Eighty-two...Okay. Any contact...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORTON: No. For me, it was a snake pit. Again, I measured my force against it.
                    And I found myself wanting. I missed out, probably, on a relationship with my
                    elder brother. My elder brother who was a mechanical draftsman, a worker, and my
                    younger brother who I think became a professorather distinguished professor of
                    philosophy, bioethics, that sort of thing. But I didn't. It destroyed my
                    capacity to be a member of the family. Too bad. I don't consider myself a model
                    in any way. It's not a model behavior, but that's the way it panned out for me
                    and, hey, if you've got a broken leg, you limp. I limped. I mean, it was better
                    than not having a leg at all. I limped. It was all right. I'm not a
                    long-distance runner.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left for where first? And when you left that first
                        time, is that when relations were cut off before?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORTON: They were cut before. I left in 1969. I reached the magic age. Don't
                    forget, this is VietnaVietnam that awoke us. The Civil Rights movement awoke us.
                    It was a period of extraordinary ferment and wasn't a happy period for families.
                    Many families broke up. I wasn't the only one. A lot of families broke up on
                    those reefs. I understood labor, of course. My family had worked so hard. They
                    had suffered through the Depression and finally they had a little breathing
                    space. Hard to breathe breathing space. Maybe we'll talk about American
                    insecurity, but we had a house. We had some security. And they give birth to
                    children who, at that time, grew up in the time of full employment. That's the
                    Golden Age. We're talking about three thousand years ago.</p>
                <p>That was in the '60's, full employment. Wanted adventure! Wanted to discover.
                    People of all sorts, not just in their particular ethnic community, who wanted
                    to have sexual relations outside of the institutional sanction, who wanted to
                    travel, who wanted to fuck up. To a certain extent, I think yes, a certain
                    number of the newer generation wanted to fuck up. They called it, “Have fun.”
                    That was the drug generation. That, of course, never tempted me. Never tempted
                    me. I'll tell you why. Because I was very young. I was thirteen, fourteen. I
                    don't know how we did it, but we had a little comba couple of friends of
                    mindrums and piano and clarineand we used to hang around the bars. I don't know
                    how they let us in the taverns; they were strip joints on the bowery. And we'd
                    listen to the musicians because the musicians were really quite good jazz
                    musicians but they were on cough syrup for want of anything better. And then
                    other things. And I met jazz musicians who were so brilliant, so wonderful, and
                    so destroyed by heroin. It was heroin. It was smack. Don't forget, this is
                    before drugs came to suburbia. Marijuana, man, you got caught with a roach, you
                    got sent to Stillwater for six years. Marijuana was in the black community;
                    heroin was in the black community.</p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>So when the 60's came and there was a war and the Civil Rights movement and all
                    of that, the generation that came out of these hard-working parentgone through
                    World War II, alsthey wanted something quite different from their parents. Some
                    of them took the road of drugthe drug generation, the flower generation. Some of
                    them “the hippie don't do anything” generation, you know, and have fun. Peace
                    and love. New age, before the term was coined. And others turned toward
                    political activism. And that was what I was in, sort of, because by then I had
                    already discovered philosophy. I had already discovered poetry. And those are
                    the secret springs of my life.</p>
                <p>So my political activism was an ethical stand and went very well with the idea of
                    lech l'chgo, go, go for it. I think I was quite insightful. In 1969, when I
                    decided to leave the United States... When I did leave the United States: I had
                    decided to leave the United States when I was born... That was the last year, I
                    believe, that PhD's could get a job. In 1970, PhD's had a great deal of
                    difficulty. There were no more slots for them. It may even be the case that full
                    employment died its unnatural death at the end of the 1960's. I felt that. I
                    didn't like school. I wanted an adventure. I wanted my life to be an adventure.
                    I wanted to be a hero. Not in other people's eyes. Not even in mine. Under the
                    eye of eternity, I wanted to go. I heard that in my ears: “Go. See what happens.
                    And do what you must.” So, off I went.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You went where first?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORTON: To Ireland.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Graduate school or...college was where, when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORTON: I left the University of Wisconsin in 1969 and went to Ireland. Couldn't
                    find a job. My then wife, we had some of her money, and we spent it in Dalkey
                    which was where the Martello tower of Stephen Dedalus is. So I mean, “stately
                    plump Buck Mulligan” went down the tower steps almost within view of the house I
                    had on the rocky hillside. It's where Stephen Dedalus taught Algebra, by the
                    way, for those who know Ulysses. So that was very exciting. I couldn't find a
                    job, but I was looking when the troubles in Northern Ireland broke out. And
                    there was a lot of political agitation, political discussion. I discovered the
                    Maoists. I had a memorable meeting in Trinity College when the Maoists attacked
                    James Joyce for not being in Dublin on Easter Sunday in 1916 but for being in
                    Trieste. That sort of thing stuck in my mind and was one of the landmarks, one
                    of the guardrails of my thought in ethics and in politics. What matters is the
                    individual. What matters is human kindness. Can I read something from Life and
                    Fate?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>NORTON: And life...this is from Life and Fate, the great novel of Vasily
                    Grossman. I feel very close to his somewhat Chekhovian ethics. And this is from
                    that book.</p>
                <p>Remember, this is the Maoists saying James Joyce was guilty because he didn't
                    participate in the uprising in 1916. This is with the words still fresh in my
                    mind of this woman in Paris later on who said that, “Why do you attack Stalin's
                    crimeall of the tens of millions of people he killed. Some of them, after all,
                    were enemies of the people.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who said that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORTON: It was a womajust a conversation. Somehow I learn more from conversations
                    than books. I, as I said, learned slowly to pay attention to what's around
                    me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: She said, “Why do you concentrate on the crimes of Stalin
                        when some guilty were taken away?”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORTON: Yah.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's get your reaction to that. Sounds like a foolish
                        question. Let's hear that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORTON: That's like the Maoist saying, “Where was James Joyce?” In other words,
                    he was candidate for the Gulag. “Whenever,” said Vasily Grossman, “we see the
                    dawn of an eternal good...whenever we see this dawn, the blood of old people and
                    children is all we shed.... Human history is not the battle of good struggling
                    to overcome evil. It is a battle fought by a great evil struggling to crush a
                    small kernel of human kindness.” I swore when I left, wanting in some way
                    unimaginable to me to contribute to the reform of the world, that I never would
                    sacrifice truth to the advancement of a cause no matter how good. I swore that,
                    and I kept my oath.</p>
                <p>Let me go to another passage from Vasily Grossman. “Let's begin with man; let's
                    be kind and attentive to the individual man — whether he's a bishop, a peasant,
                    an industrial magnate, a convict in the Sakhalin Islands, or a waiter in a
                    restaurant. Let's begin with respect, compassion, and love for the individual —
                    or we'll never get anywhere.”</p>
                <p>He speaks from my heart.</p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>In Paris after leaving Ireland I became involved in post-1968 left-wing politics.
                    I was a fellow traveler with the Ligue Communiste R�volutionnaire, a Trotskyite
                    organization. At one moment, a very critical moment in my life when I met Toto
                    Bissainthe with whom I stayed for twenty-two years, we'll talk more about her, I
                    suddenly realized something: that none of my comrades were friends. None of
                    them, I would never want any of them as friends. Somehow, and I didn't quite
                    understand it, something was wrong. Of course what was wrong was the absence of
                    the spirit I have just been talking about. It's not necessary to say what I
                    imagine they would say about those words. I don't see, however, that those
                    people who have been inspired by those words have caused as much suffering as
                    the people who have not, who believe that violence is necessary. A positive
                    aspect of history, its midwife not its butcher.</p>
                <p>“You can't make omelets without cracking eggs.” How many times has Lenin's
                    expression been repeated? How many people who have repeated it realize that they
                    are eggs? Do they look in the mirror and see an egg? Their child, an egg? That's
                    all?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You said earlier that during the awakening of the 60's
                        there was the Vietnam issue, the Civil Rights issue, and there were various
                        options among those who sought something else. The one you chose was
                        political activism. Were you disillusioned with the Trotskyite
                        movement?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORTON: This is not a play where you have to choose between honor and love. I was
                    bemused. I chose love and revolt rather than violence and power. I chose myself.
                    I chose to be the poet who would contribute as he could to further the
                    betterment of society, a society of which I was a part. To live the ethical
                    life. I did not reject...how could I? I learned so much from Marxism. Marx will
                    come back. Marx may be buried, but he is not dead. When I was in college, not in
                    graduate school, there was no mention of Marx in the books. You could get a
                    doctorate in sociology without having even read, let alone denounced or refuted
                    Marx. He just didn't exist, you know? He just disappeared. Class exists. Class
                    conflict exists. Class struggle exists, come on. Economic determinism exists.
                    So, I mean, Marx slapped me in the face, “Wake up!” How you make your living
                    shapes how you live, what you think about life.</p>
                <p>Now, the ultimate benefit of it for me was basically paying attention to
                    realitreal situations. Gradually I realized that the concrete analysis of
                    concrete situations was exceptional, that it wasn't particularly practiced by
                    official Marxists because they had an ax to grind. The defense of the Soviet
                    Union, the defense of their particular political faction. It's not easy to make
                    an analysis, and if your general is truth and not Commandante Zero, you're going
                    to get into conflict, and I assumed that conflict. I assumed it fully. So, I
                    mean, it was no disillusionment with Trotskyism. It was, oh, something's
                    missing, and I didn't really figure it out until much later. It all has to do
                    with human rights. It has to do with the Republic. It has to do with forms and
                    forums. It has to do with respect for forms and forums. I learned that after I
                    left with Toto to wend my way towards Haiti.</p>

                </p>
                <p>NORTON: No, no, no, it's wonderful. It was a wonderful choice that I made. It was
                    enormously instructive. It helped me. I had at least the wisdom or the luck to
                    stop. I met Toto, who was pure love and revolt and not violence and power the
                    summer I was going to go to camp to learn how to use arms. I stopped.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's just get to chronology. You were in Ireland and then
                        you ended up in Paris...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORTON: 1972.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were married. There was Toto. We don't need to get

                <p>NORTON: Well, I obviously got divorced.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sorry, you went to Ireland in '69.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORTON: '69, and then...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What got you to Paris?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORTON: And then in 1970 I came to Paris. Began worthe job I held until 1979. I
                    taught English as a foreign language. I had some experience in
                    linguisticteaching, as a matter of fact, Japanese teachers of foreign language
                    how to teach English as a foreign language, so it was a logical choice. At that
                    time I was teaching English in businesses. I got to meet the French people in
                    the way most people didn't because I taught chief executives, workers, hair
                    dressers, engineers, publishers, secretaries, writers...it was wonderful. I
                    could sharpen my techniques of interviews. I realized I had a gift for
                    interviewing and I would teach basically through interviehelp people say what
                    they had to say but to say it in a foreign language, and it was quite wonderful.
                    I stayed until 1979.</p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>And then, of course, having met Toto who, just to be brief, was, in my opinion,
                    the greatest artist that Haiti ever produceactress, singer, writer.. She didn't
                    think she wrote well, but she wrote marvelously well in Creole. You know, when
                    people meet a genius, something happens. I mean, I had the enormous privilege of
                    living with a genius for twenty-two years with all the ups and downs and I don't
                    need to go into that... Toto married Haitian and French culture, Creole and
                    French culture. She would recite Rimbaud, Bateau Ivre, just like that. She was
                    one of the founders of Les Griots, that put on Genet's Les Negres (The Blacks).
                    She was in the original cast. She played Beckett. That's an example. She did
                    Moliere. She sang in an opera. Under the hardest taskmistress of my life, I
                    began to write in French.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This interview is about you, but we have to find out what
                        brought Toto to France. How did she...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORTON: She left in one of the migrations before Duvalier. She went to New York
                    and then she went to Paris to pursue her studies. And she was a natural, and so
                    quite quickly she was in movies and she was in, well, not so many movies, and
                    theater. And then in the 1970's she began singing. That's when I met her, and
                    she began discovering herself as a Haitian and putting together these marvelous
                    groups to sing Haiti and to sing against tyranny wherever it was. And, of
                    course, I began to do what I could for her. It was a movement to liberate Haiti
                    where, you must understand, there was a very definite correspondence between my
                    past and my present.</p>
                <p>I remembered my musical past, remembered when I was a jazz fan, and I wrote songs
                    for her. And I wrote words and music for her. And things for her showthe poems
                    that she would recitin French. And so, she was a hard taskmistress. She would
                    never tell me what was the matter. She would just say, “This is shit.” Why is it
                    shit? So I just kept going back and back and back to the drawing board and found
                    out it was shit indeed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're talking about the texts that you wrote for her
                        songs.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORTON: Yah, well for whatever. For whatever. Several of them were recorded. Most
                    of them she didn't like. She liked the writing I did for her theatrical
                    performances.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the reception for her in France?</hi>

                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>NORTON: Fabulous. Fabulous, especially beginning with 1976, but she had a
                    destructive streak in her. She would have been quite famous. She appeared on
                    television. Our readers don't know who Jacques Chancel was, but she had an hour
                    devoted to her ...it's like NBC for an hour-long show. The Humanity Festival of
                    the French Communist Party, ten thousand people stood up and applauded.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could she walk by and be recognized by people?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORTON: No, I don't think so. I don't think so. She wasn't a star. She was a
                    counter-culture star, yah. Anybody who knew anything about music...she did Vodou
                    songs, but she did fusion with jazz musicians, with African drummers. And she
                    had a stage presence which was beyond belief.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did your own political activism fade as your
                        knowledge...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORTON: No, it didn't fade. It stopped. Immediately, immediately. And took a
                    quantum leap. I realized it was absolutely crazy, and that you don't engage your
                    life with people you don't even like. I mean...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Immediately when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORTON: In 1972. And I still kept thinking what to do, how to do it, and I was
                    wound up in her activities and then writing myself, writing poetry. These are my
                    works. All of those. But that's...my real me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're looking at a bookcase with manuscripts. About
                        fifteen different manuscripts which is Mike's basic work.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORTON: Right. The conquest of the West, basically. That's the first four
                    volumes. And then a journal from Haiti and then other writings.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As I see, these are manuscripts. Some things were

                </p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>NORTON: I published a little book in Spanish in 1998. I was in the Dominican
                    Republic and I fell in love with the Spanish language. I wrote a little book in
                    Spanish that I published in Cuba book of poems. Curiously enough, I think one of
                    the best things I ever wrote. Crazy, crazy. I like that little book very, very
                    much. Out of despair, out of anguish, I wrote that book. But that's another me.
                    Another me is in Eschatology, my latest book of poems, which should be published
                    in 2008.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, Mike, we've got you in 1972 in Paris. You've turned
                        away from political activism and you've turned...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORTON: Political activism of that sort.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of that sort. Let's get you from '72 to '79.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORTON: Well, Toto was particularly committed. She was Haitian. She was a
                    descendant of Roi Christophe, King Christophe who built the Citadel. She was all
                    fire. She was storm. She was sincerity and force. Somebody who never let
                    anything pass. In Paris that meant getting into fights with Parisian racists
                    every day. And never let anything pass. Do you understand what that means? I
                    want you to consider that. Never let anything pass. Never. If anybody says
                    anything in your presence which is base, mean, patently false, you pick that up.
                    She would throw that in their faces. She was never violent, never raised her
                    voice. But she never let anything pass. No injustice was tolerable. She would
                    act on the spur of the unjust moment.</p>
                <p>It became unbearable. And the tug of Haiti was so strong. Jean-Claude Duvalier
                    was still in power. She made some trips to Haiti where she became known as a
                    singer of French songs because her idea was to introduce the best French songs
                    to the Haitian public. But of course it was a bourgeois public. And also she
                    needed money because we were always dirt poor. We never had any money. And she
                    would sing Brassens. She would sing Ferr�. Oh, she sang Ferr� better than Ferr�,
                    oh! Piaf better than Piaf. Brel. She was a marvelous interpreter of the French
                    repertoire. But then the family there found her somewhat worrisome. So they told
                    us that we were banned. We, I say, because at one moment in, what was it, 1975,
                    was the first time I went back to the United States, in New York, where she gave
                    a concera benefit for Haitian refugees. And because of that, family members in
                    Haiti claimed that the Interior Minister had put us on the black list. So...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Black list meaning what. Banned politically?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORTON: From going to Haiti. Both of us.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But she went?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORTON: No. So she didn't go any more. After 1975 or 1976. That lasted until the
                    early 80's when another, less reactionary part of the family informed her that
                    it was false. We never were on a black list. She never was in exile. It was not
                    true. She was a pain in the ass because she never let anything pass.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So this was the family who gave her this false
                        message...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORTON: Early on, in the early 1960's, one of her first trips back to Haiti when
                    she first sang, she would sing the song of revolt of the anarchists. Leo Ferr�.
                    She was an anarchist. She would sing them in Creole translation, and Fran�ois
                    Duvalier wanted to see her. Wanted a command performance and she refused. And
                    the part of the family that later prevented our coming to Haiti for many years
                    pled with her that, “We'll be killed.” So she went. And there, she sang the same
                    songs to his face. You know, revolt against tyranny, and after, she went to
                    salute Papa Doc. And Papa Doc says, “You know, you really told those white
                    people off.” The limits of art, let us say. Papa Doc Duvalier considered himself
                    a revolutionary up there with Ho Chi Minh. So, I mean, if you're talking against
                    tyranny, you're not talking about him. So anyways...</p>

                </p>
                <p>NORTON: No. I decide I am flattered when you insult in general terms the tyrant.
                    I'm not a tyrant. I'm against tyrants. I'm with you. We're together. Black

                        anything pass.” Was there anything resonant with your own childhood?</hi>

                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>NORTON; Well, everything was “let pass” like in most American childhoods. We let
                    everything pass. We don't sneeze. Of course. She was a very difficult
                    person.</p>

                </p>
                <p>NORTON: Yah, but it took years, it took years, it took years, it took years. I
                    reacted sometimes, generally after the fact. She never let a heartbeat pass. Try
                    it some day. Don't let a heartbeat pass. Don't go home and then come back. Don't
                    let a heartbeat pass. You probably won't even know you're deeply offended. You
                    probably won't even know that what the person said is ignoble. She knew. She
                    reacted. Very difficult to live up to, after that. I didn't measure up. I mean,
                    I did what I could. It wasn't good enough.</p>

                </p>
                <p>NORTON: Because I think she saw in me what I would become. And because I was a
                    little bit of it already. Because I was pretty smart and because I was of help
                    to her. Because I was mad about her. Because I was eager and innocent. Because
                    1+1=3, or Infinity.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: She was the leader and you were the follower.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORTON: Oh, you couldn't follow Toto. I mean you'd walk on the street with
                    someone who's always ahead of you. She just walked faster. And she had a goal.
                    And she knew where she was going. And fearless. Fearless. I remember, and we'll
                    come back to this in 1987, the terrible day of November 29, 1987 when the
                    general elections, the first in which democracy may have been possible. I'd like
                    to come back, since we're talking about democracy, to see about the Republic,
                    before we get to Haiti. I just want to say one thing about her fearlessness and
                    then trace my itinerary from Paris to Haiti. And then just a word about what I
                    was already on the way to learn. I'll talk about the American way of life, and
                    then when we talk about Haiti, I'll talk about the Jewish tradition.</p>

                <p>And it was 1987, November 29, 1987. She was in P�tionville lined up with others
                    to cast their ballots. Already that summer hundreds of people in the countryside
                    had been killed by the army, which didn't want these elections. The army that
                    the U.S. Embassy and the U.S. government necessarily supported and believed in,
                    and they wanted to run the country after Duvalier had been ousted.</p>

                </p>
                <p>NORTON: No, we're in 1987. We're not in this...it's complicated.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Duvalier's army.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORTON: Duvalier's army that ousted him, but Duvalier's army that wanted to take
                    his place, obviously, and did for a while. And so, all of a sudden, shots rang
                    out and a car with gunmen drove by, scattering the voters. Elsewhere, voting
                    stations were attacked. People were killed. Dozens and dozens and dozens. The
                    toll that day, I don't know, dozens and dozens. When you think of massacres in
                    Rwanda or even in Iraq, it doesn't amount to much. But during the summer,
                    hundreds and hundreds and hundreds had been killed by the army commandos, death
                    squads, and so forth.</p>
                <p>After, when I came back, it was a long, long trip I made around town reporting
                    for the radio. And she was embarrassed. She said, “I didn't stand up to them.”
                    And then somebody who was there said, “You didn't stand up to them? We picked
                    you up off the street unconscious because you ran after them with your fist
                    raised shouting insults at them in their face and you were so intensely irate
                    that you lost consciousness.” Toto Bissainthe. Buy her records. You can still
                    get them. So, we left Paris. Her sisteshe had a sister who lived in Martiniquand
                    there we stayed for a couple of years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, '79 now?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORTON: '79 and we left for...I continued teaching English as a foreign language
                    and getting to know Martinique. I worked on the plantations. I worked across the
                    different class lines and color lines. I was one of the very few who knew the
                    black population as well as the b�k�, descendants of the French colonists. I was
                    sharpening my skills analyzing the society, a society rather different from the
                    one that...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The b�k� is what we would call Creoles?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>NORTON: Creoles, yah. And five years. And then we had friends in the Dominican
                    Republic and that's right next to Haiti, isn't it? And then we went to the
                    Dominican Republic to wait.</p>
                <p>Duvalier fell too soon. The Americans pushed the army to get rid of him. Too soon
                    for the democratic forces to mature. Maybe they never would have. Knowing them
                    from the outside, they never had their act together. They never had any program.
                    And later I realized to a certain extent that the Duvalierists were right. That
                    the so-called democrats just wanted to take their place. They had no plan. They
                    had no thought for Haiti. There was no language for a revolution that wasn't
                    Marxist. You have to realize that. This was a political revolution. You're going
                    from a slave society in isolatioa state that was militarized that then became a
                    dictatorship that had at its origin slogans “liberty, equality, fraternity” and
                    used words like “the republic” and “legal system” and all of that, but it was
                    just a show. The state was basically an instrument of repression, repression in
                    the service of oppression.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it in some cases the language of the early nineteenth
                        century?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORTON: Yah, but, again, it's the language of whom? Whose language was it? It
                    wasn't the language of the people. We'll get to that when we talk about the fall
                    of Duvalier and what prospect it opened for Haiti and how I saw myself in that
                    perspective and how the United States blinked and then blindfolded itself. Do
                    remember, if we're talking about blinking and then blinding, I just skimmed the
                    diary of Ronald Reagan the other day, and he talked briefly about the army
                    ouster of president Leslie Fran�ois Manigat. I don't recall exactly, but in his
                    diary, and it's in two entries, he calls him “Margrat,” or something like
                    that.</p>
                <p>Come on. Don't excuse this sort of ignorance. No French president would make such
                    a mistake. No French president could ever reach the height of power being so
                    ignorant of the world. The Founding Fathers were cosmopolitan and isolationist.
                    For going on two centuries, almost every American leader has been provincial and
                    all have been interventionist. So, Haiti, a dust particle in the world, close to
                    the nose of the United States, tickling it, making it sneeze. Neither nose nor
                    dust particle will go away. We'll talk about that. And so Duvalier fell and we
                    crossed the border in the small plane piloted by the man who later would become
                    Aristide's pilot.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm going to be an annoyance here. Is there anything here
                        we've missed from the departure from Paris to Martinique to the Dominican
                        Republic? Anything we need to add to get you up to that date of entering
                        into Haiti?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>NORTON: Something was developing in my thinking about politics, about the
                    complete irrelevance of Marxist thought to the development in Haiti. It forced
                    me to turn. And it wasn't far from mthe key to a revolution in Haiti. As I said,
                    the difficulty of the democratic movement, so-called democratic movement, to
                    effectuate a political revolution in a country like Haiti was seriously
                    compromised by the lack of a tradition. They didn't know how to think it
                    through. They didn't have an eighteenth century enlightenment the way the
                    Founding Fathers had to think it through. Even if it's mechanically.
                    Mechanism...it's a machine, the Constitution, that's turned into an organism
                    through wisdom, through interpretation. It came out of the eighteenth century.
                    The background of the Haitian democratic movement was either liberal, which
                    means non-thought. We'll have political parties and then elections and then
                    we'll run the country. And we'll get foreign aid. Or Marxist. Now, Marxism was
                    dying in its official form. This was in 1986. It was kept alive by Cuba and
                    being kept alive worrying American policy makers. So maybe in a sense, American
                    policy makers were right not to trust the democratic movement to take power.
                    Something had to be thought through.</p>
                <p>I looked into myself and I realized that this foreigner that was myselforeigner
                    in the United States because I felt so out of iwas American. And then, just
                    jumping ahead a little, in October 1986, a couple of months after the ousting of
                    Duvalier, I saw the army in power, with a couple of civilians who were soon
                    ousted. The Constitution, oh, so badly written. The result of so many
                    contradictory forces but written in the public eye. The sessions were broadcast
                    on the radio, so something from the people's point of view came across.</p>
                <p>Nobody expected anybody to turn out. For the election of the Constituent Assembly
                    in October, 1986, most of the people I talked to prophesied one percent. I said,
                    “No, no, there's something there. I think ten percent.”</p>
                <p>Thirty percent came out, and how they turned out! In white, in a rage with
                    dignity in a country that is supposed to be anarchic (whatever that means), and
                    disorderly (whatever that means), lining up for hours in the hot sun dressed in
                    ceremonial white to cast their ballot for a Constituent Assembly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: October '86.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORTON: It was in October...was it the tenth? I don't remember. October '86,
                    yah.</p>

                <p>Haitians do not ordinarily line up. They line up for the sacrament. They line up
                    to vote. What we're talking about is not democracy; what we're talking about is
                    the Republic. What is a political movement? What is politics? What is a
                    constitution? What is the republic? What is democracy? Those were the central
                    questions that I addressed when I crossed the border, and I guess the school was
                    the Founding Fathers and the American way of life which I discovered to be my
                    way. It was obviously not popcorn and the bleachers. I'm sorry. I have nothing
                    against baseball. It's just it's not my thing. Not rock and roll. I'm a marginal
                    person; I like jazz. I don't like violence. I don't like the arrogance. It is
                    not so-called family values, in God we trust. As I said, I left the United
                    States because I felt wanting in strength, unable to stick it out in the detours
                    of the American way of life. But the American way of life is civil liberties.
                    The American way of life is justice. The American way of life is rule of law.
                    Respect for the individual. Allowance for difference. Belief in redemption,
                    second chances. Not human kindness, but aren't we a short step from that?</p>

                </p>
                <p>NORTON: I think that in certain respects it's a reality. Obviously, at this
                    particular junction in history, the republic may be in the last phase of the
                    Republic. It's obvious that the signs are there. That the leaders are not, I
                    won't say democratic, I'll say republican. They do not believe in the Republiin
                    the ideal of the Republiin guaranteeing the rights of minorities, in checks and
                    balances, and in promoting the greatest possible freedom, and insisting on
                    accountability for acts taken.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How is this different from democracy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORTON: Democracy is, this is Kant, democracy is a form of sovereignty. Republic
                    is a form of government. It comes right out of Immanuel Kant. I was very struck
                    by that. Don't confuse the two. The Republic protects democracy, but it doesn't
                    give all power to the majority. It is a system that guarantees, or that attempts
                    to guarantee, the greatest possible freedom and justice for all with respect for
                    the individual. It's not about prosperity. It's about happiness.</p>
                <p>May I just say one word about the pursuit of life, liberty, and happiness?
                    Happiness in the eighteenth century meant virtue. And virtue meant public
                    virtue. You have the right to be a good citizen, to pursue that ideal. The ideal
                    of a good citizen. It's not getting high, eh? It's not 250 television channels.
                    It's not a credit card. It's not a vacation. It's permanent. It's permanent. You
                    pursue life, liberty, and happiness permanently. Again, happiness being public
                    virtue. The Republic is of citizens not of consumers or producers or owners.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's dwell on that for a minute. I think in Locke it was
                        life, liberty, and property. I think.</hi>

                <p>NORTON: Yah.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why do you think that they took out property and put
                        happiness?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORTON: Because I think happiness, in Jefferson's sense, was broader. To be a
                    citizen, you have to have the right to property. Now, what is property? You can
                    be a socialist and believe in the right to property. A socialist community
                    maintains property rights. Just the definition that Marx gave to capitalistic
                    property is private ownership of public wealth. No, no, no, no, no. No private
                    appropriation of public property. No expropriation.. No, no, no, no, no.
                    Property: my house, my books, my ticket, my passport. Property. That's property.
                    That's mine. Meum, tuum. That's what it is. Socialist property would prohibit
                    private parties from owning the local electricity company, from monopolizing the
                    air waves, from becoming the gatekeeper of the Internet, from controlling the
                    flow of information. Excuse me! Private property is not the right of insurance
                    companies to control the health insurance market. That's a public... Katrina did
                    not destroy houses and streets and school300,000 houseKatrina destroyed a city.
                    What is a city? It is a public good. It is relations between people. It is my
                    grandmother up the street who will take care of my kids so I can go to work. I
                    don't have flood insurance. Well, okay, really you should have thought of it but
                    maybe you didn't have enough money. It is the responsibility of the federal
                    government to promote the general welfare of its citizens, to ensure domestic
                    tranquility, to secure the blessings of liberty, etc. The Preamble of the
                    Constitution is not legally binding. But the Constitution is a means to the end
                    the Preamble spells out. A city was destroyed in the United States of America
                    and it is still unrehabilitated. What?! A city was destroyed, and citizenship
                    was, too? Is this not a scandal that shouts the direct answer to your question
                    in the face of the world? This is the Republic? Res Publica. Public good. Public
                    thing. New Orleans was my city, too. Jazz was born there. Jazz, which, with the
                    Constitution and the Blues, is one of the three major contributions of America
                    to world civilization.</p>
                <p>I hear people recommending that people who can't find jobs in New Orleans go
                    somewhere else. 4.5 per cent unemployment nationally. What kind of inhuman
                    idiocy is that? A city is more than its inhabitants. A sea is not a countless
                    number of water drops. It is the responsibility of government officials to be
                    their brothers' keeper, as Obama said. That is what ensures national security.
                    We'll leave it there for today.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's stop. This is the end of interview number one. It's
                        Dan Whitman interviewing Mike Norton. We are September 6th, and we have
                        ended at the point where Mike crossed the border into Haiti in 1986. We're
                        going to take up from that point on the next interview.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>Okay, this is the second session in Dan Whitman interviewing Mike Norton in
                    Caguas Puerto Rico, 6th of September, 2007. Now, Mike, when we left, we had just
                    gotten you over the border from the Dominican Republic to Haiti during a
                    tumultuous period. Describe to us what was going on in Haiti and what took you
                    there and what happened to you.</p>
                <p>NORTON: It was in August. I think it was August 16, 1986. It was the day that
                    Balaguer came to power again. I've often thought of how interesting it would be
                    to write a book on Balaguer, Trujillo, and Fran�ois Duvalier. One lesson I think
                    you can learn from Balaguer is that cynicism in politics cannot be successful in
                    a value vacuum, in a power vacuum. Duvalier lost power. That's the son of
                    Fran�ois Duvalier, Jean-Claude Duvalier — in February, exactly on the 7th of
                    February, 1986. Every attempt since then or almost every with two exceptions
                    have been attempts to reestablish the dictatorship. And, on each occasion,
                    doomed to failure, whether the dictatorship did or did not have popular support,
                    was headed by a dictator with or without populace rapport.</p>
                <p>The two exceptions that come to mind are when Supreme Court Justice Ertha Pascal
                    Trouillot, who was a provisional president, handed over power to Jean-Bertrand
                    Aristide in 1991 and in 2006, when the current president, Ren� Pr�val, began his
                    second term. His first term is a bit ambiguouthe term that took him from 1996 to
                    2001, since he was really bench-warming for Aristide. So it's really difficult
                    to say whether he wanted to establish a dictatorship or not. I think he wanted
                    to get out of it alive, which is a strange position for somebody who wants to be
                    a dictator. He didn't want to be one. He wanted out in one piece.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Later we'll ask the question: If that's what he wanted,
                        and he always said so, then why did he run for president?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORTON: We can get to that later, but quickly to answer your question, because
                    Aristide wasn't there. So the regime of Fran�ois Duvalier was inherited by his
                    son, Baby Doc, they called him, Jean-Claude Duvalier. I don't know why they
                    called him Baby Doc. So idiotic. Just nicknames.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because of his pudgy face, I think.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>NORTON: He was, but he didn't end pudgy. He was a good-looking guy, finally.
                    Completely in the hands of his wife who was a grasping upstart from the, what
                    they call petite bourgeoisie, which means not petit bourgeois but a bourgeois
                    who is not very wealthy and who wound up air conditioning the national palace,
                    that enormous building, that enormous birthday cake within view and smell of the
                    slums of Port-au-Prince, the capital. Air-conditioning it so she could wear her
                    furs. She wasted a lot of money. The slight prosperity that had begun in the
                    1970's after Baby Doc took poweafter Jean-Claude Duvalier, excuse me, took
                    powefrittered away when the assembly industry started collapsing.</p>
                <p>And since 1980 until today, if I'm not mistaken, Haiti has been in a depression.
                    A 27- year long depression. Sometimes they gain a point or two in GNP, but what
                    does that mean. They're so far from where they were 25 or 30 years ago that it
                    will take a long time, if ever, to regain that GNP. The regime, I think,
                    couldn't continue. Popular discontent. Human rights movements all over the world
                    and the United States collaboratewas a willing collaborator with the Haitian
                    army to oust Jean-Claude Duvalier. The democratic movement, as I already said,
                    was by and large outside and I think unfamiliar with the terrain and especially
                    unequipped with the languagto deal with the situation. How to develop a country
                    like Haiti. Most statistics for Haiti are unreliable. It is difficult to tell
                    you how many people are unemployed. They say, according to the latest census,
                    that there are eight million people. Maybe more now. We don't know how many are
                    unemployed. Most of the people are unemployed or underemployed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The latest census was quite a long time ago, was it
                        not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORTON: No, under Aristide, the last term. Most of the population is
                    underemployed or unemployed. Underemployed means, you know, living hand to
                    mouth. That means scufflingoing from house to house to get a bowl of rice or
                    something, corn meal, corn mush. Most of the population is still supposedly in
                    the countryside but it's very difficult to distinguish the countryside from the
                    cities because it just goes back and forth, back and forth, back and forth. Most
                    of the population is illiterate. The countryside has deteriorated. Most of the
                    country, 95%, is a desert. The chances for recovery of this sick nation are
                    very, very, slim. But it has gotten worse, what I have just described, this
                    current Haiti. In 1986, it was well under way to deterioration. But the despair
                    had turned into anger and into hope. And, to the surprise of everybody, the
                    people didn't just accept their newly won “freedom from oppression.” They took
                    things into their own hands.</p>
                <p>The U.S. and the Haitian military had opened a Pandora's box. Once out, the
                    people did not want to climb back in. The powers that be underestimated their
                    demand for a better life.</p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>The ports that had been closed for security reasons under Duvalier were opened. A
                    flow of used goods came to the country creating this extraordinary population of
                    middlemen, stimulating the growth of the informal economy. Few people have gone
                    into studying the relationship between the desire for democracy and this
                    extraordinary free enterprise atmosphere where anybody could become a small
                    businessman. All you needed was a little capital and you could buy your cans of
                    Carnation and your soap, your pots and pans and your Crest and your Marlboros
                    and you could sell them on the street corner and turn a dollar. How much do
                    Haitians live on a day? People talk about one dollar a day. That's nonsense.
                    There's no way of knowing, no way of converting how Haitians or what Haitians
                    live on a day. That's nonsense. People survive and there is no monetary
                    equivalent of survival.</p>
                <p>You don't have any money for a week, but every day maybe you'll scrounge and get
                    a bowl of rice at your friends'. Most people wake up hungry in Haiti. Most
                    people are born, and this is very important, with 99% of their potentiality
                    nipped in the bud. That is called oppression. That is not repression. Repression
                    is political. Oppression is the situation. It's the sky falling in, falling down
                    on your head. The sky has fallen on the head of Haitians. It is one of the most
                    oppressive societies you can imagine. I will not go over all of the figures -
                    the illiteracy, the death rate, the infant death rate, the maternal death rate,
                    the AIDS. All of that, you know, goes up and down. It's a disaster. All of the
                    wells in Haiti's main town, Port-au-Princmetropolitan Port-au-Princall of them,
                    there are about twenty of them, are polluted. People who can drink water that
                    comes out of the earth, and there's less and less of it. And since there is no
                    zoning, what there is of it is polluted.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The supposed income figures...did the importance not
                        change when subsistence agriculture disappeared for many people?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORTON: I think that's another question. I don't think we have time to go into an
                    economic history of Haiti. What is important, I think, is the relevance of
                    statistics in a country like Haiti. The donor nations - please don't let me say
                    international community, let's say donor nations and if I say international
                    community please chastise mthe donor nations have to get a handle on this
                    slippery creature. The Human Development Index tells us what? In which countries
                    is the humanity of human beings the most and least developed? Americans are more
                    fully human than Haitians? Speak of ethnocentrism! The UN experts cannot factor
                    hospitality and solidarity and courage into the scores. How do you get a handle
                    on a society? You get a handle on it by means of figures. That's all. How are we
                    going to judge if there's any improvement? Well, that the average income has
                    increased, say, by fifty cents or whatever is absolutely ridiculous. In Haiti,
                    things don't function that way. I guess that would be the major theme of what I
                    have to say about Haiti. Things don't function our way.</p>

                        republican and other things are key. What is it that is pejorative about the

                </p>
                <p>NORTON: A community for me is something that is close-knit, that's organic.
                    Something more than based on interest. Shared values. History. What it's
                    supposed to mean is an international bloa bloc of nations that's acting in a
                    similar way toward Haiti. Community, for me, is very special. A community is
                    livinit's a living tissue of relations. The donor nations act as a bloc of
                    interests.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When the so-called Friends of Haiti used to meet on a
                        regular basis - I think it was, I'll get it wrong, Canada, EU, France,
                        Spain, US, perhaps Mexichow were they not behaving as a community?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORTON: Well, their representatives may have had coffee at their meetings. It was
                    not a coffeeklatsch. They did not represent a community. I know what a comity of
                    nations is. I don't know what a community of nations is. I don't know what that
                    possibly could mean. Not in today's world.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, are you saying that the various nations that have
                        embassies in Haiti and that are donors are acting out of self-interest and
                        failing to coordinate with...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORTON: No, I'm not saying anything like that. I'm saying only, and we can talk
                    about the behavior of the donor nations or international bloc. Just the word,
                    “community,” doesn't seem to me appropriate for nations. It just doesn't seem
                    appropriate. A bloc. Friends of Haiti. When I say self-interest, I'm not talking
                    narrowly. It's obvious that with certain exceptions, there's not much economic
                    interest in Haiti for anybody. Okay. Donor nations, friends of Haiti, etc. The
                    international financial institutions need to get a handle on Haiti. And from the
                    very beginning, you're dealing with a stubborn obstacle. You don't have reliable
                    statistics.</p>
                <p>People say that the last census was correct. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I don't
                    know how they did it. When people take opinion polls of Haitians, I don't know
                    how they do it because Haitians are not used to answering questions. They're
                    used to evading. I don't know. It has no scientific validity for me is what I'm
                    saying. But it is a necessity for the international donors to have some way to
                    get a handle on this country. And it has not, until this day, been able to get a
                    handle. Willy-nilly. Either through innocence, through ignorance, or through
                    indifference. It has not been able to. It has never read the situation
                    correctly.</p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>Let us begin with 1986. I arrive with Haiti in turmoil. There was enormous hope:
                    the creation of associations forbidden under Duvaliehundreds upon hundreds upon
                    hundreds of associationlabor unions, neighborhood political action committees,
                    economic groupings, you name it, farmers, youth groups, an incredible number of
                    thefloating on the dream of economic betterment because of all of these products
                    that are flooding into Haitsecond hand clothes, food goods of all sorts. The
                    hope was contagious and, at unequal rates of disillusionment, doomed, either to
                    dissipate or to be transformed into the raw material of charlatans. Uncontrolled
                    imports of goods destroyed Haitian manufactures. Imported rice is less expensive
                    than locally grown rice. Finally, the middleman bubble burst.</p>

                    repressive acts. It's obvious that the army didn't want what General Namphy, who

                    spite of the army. And so, a Constitution was written. I can't remember the
                    exact figures, but a Constituent Assembly was elected in October 1986, by an
                    enormous number of people in comparison to what was expected. And then when

                </p>
                <p>NORTON: Yah. And then came the referendum day the 29th of March 1987 in which you
                    had, I don't know how many people came out, certainly the majority of the
                    Haitian electorate. And, manifesting the same order, the same respect, for one
                    another. The same rejection of disorder and anarchy. The same quasi-religious
                    attitude toward casting their ballots. Yes, it passed. Now, this was the new
                    Haitian republic.</p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>The Constitution is very badly written, as I already mentioned. Everybody can
                    block everybody else. And it's so complicated that, for it to be fully
                    effective, it would take forever. I don't think it's fully effective yet,
                    because certain institutions have not yet been able to take root, local
                    assemblies and departmental assemblies and interdepartmental assemblies. And
                    they come up again and again and again, and there are so many elections it's
                    maddening.</p>

                <p>NORTON: Right, and there was no Provisional Electoral Council provided by the
                    Constitution for two elections. The Provisional Electoral Counsil was for the
                    first election, scheduled for the 29th of November 1989. Anyways, it was a mess.
                    But it was the charter. It was a constitution, that is to say a document that
                    designated a distribution of power that, unfortunately, in a lot of ways was
                    short circuited.</p>

                </p>
                <p>NORTON: No, they tolerated it. They never accepted it. But still I don't think
                    they got it. They didn't get it. They were not particularly intelligent. Don't
                    forget that subsequent dictatorships were composed of reduced factions of the
                    army because every time one faction of the army took power, it demobilized the
                    other. So the army was continually reduced in its capacity to govern. They
                    didn't get it. They didn't get it. It was suicidal. But, as I said, the
                    dictatorial tradition was so strong in Haiti and the alternative to that
                    dictatorial power was not really apparent. So the electoral campaign began.</p>
                <p>We're now in 1987 and we're heading toward the 29th of November 1987. Bloodshed.
                    Bloodshed in the countryside. Hundreds of people massacred by death squads. The
                    army with auxiliaries. The night before the 29th of November, the electoral
                    counsel under siege canceled some elections in some of the departments but
                    decided to go ahead with the other... How can you have partial general
                    elections? They had a partial general election, and it ended, of course, in
                    blood at the polls.</p>

                <p>NORTON: There was none. They were canceled. No election. It was the end of the
                    great naivet�. It was the end of the massive, massive, spontaneous, joyous
                    movement toward a new world. It wasn't a coup de grace. It was a kick in the
                    stomach.</p>
                <p>In Haiti, I wept twice: the 29th of November when I came back from the house of a
                    politician who was running for president and he was already working with the
                    military and I understood it was over.</p>
                <p>The second time was in the year 2000, April 3rd, year 2000, when the radio
                    director, opinion maker in the camp of Rene Pr�val and, at one time of Aristide,
                    Jean Dominique, was assassinated. Jean Dominique is another story. But there are
                    so many stories, I don't know that I'll ever have time to talk about Jean
                    Dominique and why I wept when he was assassinated. It's not the same thing. Jean
                    Dominique was, however, the leader of the free speech movement in the early
                    '70's. He took Jean Claude's liberalization at his word and pushed for a
                    democratic regime. He was a pioneer of the political revolution in Haiti. I wept
                    because the tradition was cut. And the hope was cut. It was all over for me.
                    There was not a glimmer of hope.</p>
                <p>But Jean Dominique's own relationship to power was anything but clear. In early
                    2000, Jean Dominique was turning from Aristide. He was becoming critical. It was
                    a heroic moment; it was a moment of heroism, in my opinion. I think he was so
                    proud, he didn't realize he was courting death. I don't think he believed he
                    was. But he had turned against the man he had believed he could influence. His
                    belief was very misguided and very harmful to the country, but that's the way it
                    is. He died heroically.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Skipping around a moment, could we discuss the language of
                        threats, both by gesture and through innuendo in the local language, Creole,
                        that makes people's intentions clear among nations and which seems to
                        obscure those intentions to outsiders.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORTON: Well, that's part of the character of this country, which is not just
                    different from the countries that are donor nations but distinct. It has to do
                    with another kind of culture. It has to do with how this country, in which the
                    human rights movement was born more than two hundred years ago, has survived.
                    The French revolution brought liberty, equality, and fraternity to everyone
                    except blacks. And Haitians said no to that when Napoleon, in 1803, decided to
                    reestablish slavery. And this French-trained army, with its French ideals but
                    with its Haitian interests, defeated the French army, the strongest army in the
                    world, through superior soldiering.</p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>People say, “No, it's not true. The French soldiers were sichad yellow fever.” On
                    the other hand, I reply the yellow fever mosquito was Haitian and was enlisted
                    in the Haitian army to defeat these foreign troops. I'm not joking. The sand of
                    Iraq is on whose side? The jungles of Vietnam were on whose side? War isn't just
                    people and guns. It's also place. Haiti defeated France to make the French words
                    a reality - liberty, equality, fraternitwell, not exactly. The Haitian generals
                    militarized Haiti. They installed a perfect imitation of the French masters. No,
                    an imperfect imitation. For whatever evil slavery represented, it was a means of
                    production. It did make people and countries very wealthy. The re-imposed lack
                    of freedom in Haiti did not make people very wealthy. It was squandering. It was
                    ostentation. It was madness. It made it impossible finally for Haiti to
                    transform itself from an agrarian to an agrarian industrial society.</p>
                <p>Since the beginning of the nineteenth century, Haiti has been cursed with fewer
                    and fewer resources, less and less forest cover with more and more despair, with
                    weaker institutions, etc. Now...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well it wasn't as rich as before. The first few decades of
                        the nineteenth century Haiti retained a relative wealth. Was this just
                        inherited from the previous system? Also, that they remained wealthy and, in
                        fact, conducted conquest.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORTON: Now that's in 1822. That's another part of Haitian history. That is the
                    imperial design of the early Haitian generals to unite Hispa�ola. Haiti had, I
                    believe, the largest standing army in the western hemisphere in the early part
                    of the nineteenth century and was considered a threat to the security of the
                    United States which did not recognize Haiti until, I believe, after the Civil
                    War. I think the great Frederick Douglass was the first U.S. ambassador to
                    Haiti, and I am generally sparing of the use of the word, “great.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now since we're in history for a moment, what was the role
                        of Haiti in permitting the U.S. to acquire Louisiana? Much has been said
                        about this. There've been some simplistic things. Napoleon lost his
                        re-supply center. Therefore, he became discouraged... I know it's much more
                        complicated than that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORTON: Well, let's come back instead to your original question about the
                    language and the otherness of Haiti. This is a country that was founded by an
                    uprising of slaves. This is an uprising of slaves. It is the only verifiable
                    example of a successful slave uprising in the history of humanity. The other
                    successful one may or may not have been historical. That is the one that is
                    recorded in Exodus in the Bible. It has been an inspiration down the ages.</p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>The Haitian example was not nothing. This was an achievement that should put
                    Haiti on the map and in the schoolbooks of all students of world history. I'm
                    just looking at a History of the World, by J. M. Roberts. The importance of
                    Haiti in the movement toward equality is not spoken of. World history books
                    don't talk about that. French education doesn't talk about that, and, of course,
                    in the United States it's little known. The American black community is so
                    alienated from its roots. Haiti was not unimportant. On the contrary, it was a
                    great event in the history of the human spirit. It degenerated. It deteriorated.
                    The lack of insight of its leaders. They didn't understand that the French
                    masters were not just cruel slave drivers; they were also makers of wealth,
                    creators of wealth. It didn't just go to spoliation. It built cities in France.
                    The slave trade built Liverpool. Sugar built Nantes in France. How much wealth?
                    A very important amount went to the construction of European civilization on the
                    backs of the slaves. In Hispa�ola, the richest country I think in the world at
                    that time, it was the most productive of wealth. Then the country withdrew into
                    itself. It was the victim of an international boycott.</p>
                <p>The ideal of the republic, institutions that guarantee rights and demand/enforce
                    obligations, for the new leaders of Haiti, all of that was just western BS -
                    trappings of western civilization. Continuing the traditiothat is a safe
                    traditioshucking and jiving. You pretend you're Western. You've got the
                    Republic. You've got this literature and music and art and all of that. You've
                    got a court. You've got an emperor. You've got a king, whatever you have. You
                    speak French. But, in fact, you don't believe a word of what you're saying, but
                    you're really good at convincing the other person that you're on their side.</p>
                <p>Whereas the country operates according to another set of criteria altogether.
                    Vodou - the Vodou religion, the Vodou culturdominates the spirit of everybody in
                    Haiti whether he be bourgeois or peasant. You don't have to practice it. It's a
                    way of being in the world. It's a mode of being in the world different from our
                    mode of being in the world. It implies another conception of causation. It
                    implies another way of conceiving of life and death. Of what is divine, what is
                    sacred and what is not. Of how you speak, when you speak, what you speak, when
                    you speak, who you are. Another conception of individuality. Another conception
                    of collectivity.</p>
                <p>Haiti is Carnival. The soul of Haiti today is in Carnival where once a year
                    individuals meld into this extraordinary creature. I say creature because when
                    you're part of a hundred thousand people moving, you don't know which way, you
                    lose control. You lose your mind. You become part of another body and that
                    body's the collective body in which you participate in a form of communion in
                    Carnival. You're recharged. Now whether Carnival is taking place or not, it's
                    there. The so-called disorder of Haiti is the disorder of a Carnival which is
                    not anarchy, which is not even disorder. It's another kind of order, another way
                    of setting things to rights. Haiti sets things to rights in a way which is
                    different from how Western countries set things to rights. Western countries set
                    things to rights with laws, rules and regulations, obligations. You know, rules
                    of the road, even rules of thumb...unequivocal language.</p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>It is the language I've been trying to speak to you in, succeeding or failing,
                    but I'm not trying to hoodwink you. I'm trying to make myself understood. Myself
                    understood, that's a mouthful. Who am I to make myself understood? A Haitian
                    makes Haiti understood when he speaks, and when you try to make something like
                    that, a Carnival, understood, you don't know whether you're coming or going.
                    There is no guarantee that the language you are hearing is unequivocal. I'm not
                    saying it's not unequivocal, but there's no reason to believe that it's not
                    equivocal. The faces are masked, the masks are faces, the faces are masks. You
                    don't know. You don't know if people are telling you the truth because truth is
                    not a value in itself. It's instrumental. Truth is instrumental. It furthers my
                    caussurvival, power, whatever. That's what truth is. Truth is not transcendent.
                    Truth is pragmatic. So lies are estimable if they're successful. You never
                    know.</p>
                <p>I could give you hundreds of examplepolitics, daily life, wherever you wish.
                    Haiti by definition to Western eyes is always wrong. Haitians have to set things
                    to rights in a hostile world, a world that arrogates the right to call Haiti to
                    account. They have to set up a false front because they are unacceptable to the
                    standard bearers of Western civilization. Haitians do not believe that the world
                    likes them. They're probably right. It becomes a little megalomaniac: “We were
                    the first black republic,” etc. “We whipped the ass of Napoleon's army.” We, we,
                    we, but that was two hundred years ago.</p>
                <p>Few Haitians know or care to know about nineteenth-century Haitian history. And
                    the founding fathers of Haiti are mythological figures. That's normal because
                    that's the kind of being Haiti is, legendary.</p>
                <p>You speak in public. You are overheard. Now my parents spoke in Yiddish. They
                    knew they were overheard, but they didn't know they were understood. Haitians
                    make themselves understood to foreigners in French. Haitians - in the apparatus
                    called the state, with its judicial system and foreign relations—speak French.
                    Yet only a small fraction of the Haitian people speaks French, a smaller
                    fraction fluently, correctly. Everyone speaks Creole, which is not bastardized
                    French but an example of a new language family. New, that is to say five hundred
                    years old, called Creole. We have CreoleEnglish Creoles, Dutch Creoles,
                    Papamiento, Talkie-talkie. We have Portuguese Creole. We have French Creoles. In
                    the Caribbean, French Creole and its dialects, its versions. It's spoken by, I
                    don't know, tens of millions of people. That's a hell of a lot of people. It's
                    not a bastardized version of French. It uses old French words. It's not a
                    mixture of African dialects and French. Its origin is in a contact situation
                    where you have slaves who speak a variety of languages, and a slave-holding
                    class. And they have to get together. They have to talk among themselves. It's a
                    pidgin that becomes a mother tongue.</p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>So everyone in Haiti speaks Creole. Okay. I could speak Creole to a Creole
                    speaker and be overheard by a foreigner. I could, but it would be like my
                    parents speaking Yiddish. Nothing guarantees that the foreigner doesn't
                    understand my language. I understand Creole. Missionaries, and there are
                    thousands of them coming down to convert the heathen, understand Creole very
                    well. What do I do to ensure that, overheard, I am not understood? I speak in
                    code. Everybody understands that it's Creole, but not everybody understands the
                    meaning of the words. You have to be prepared psychologically, culturally to
                    capture it. This kind of language, this coded language, is the language of an
                    in-group which is under threat of destruction by an out-group. In Haiti, what's
                    awful, of course, is that the out-group is, to a certain extent, interiorized by
                    the in-group. I could give you some examples if you like.</p>
                <p>I'll give you one example. On the 29th of February, 2004, Aristide was forced
                    into exile at gunpoint, figurative or real. We can go a little into what I think
                    is the background of that later. What we're talking about now is a country that
                    uses one language to speak to the foreigner, and another to itself. And it can,
                    in its use of language, have its cake and eat it too, communicate and subvert
                    communication simultaneously.</p>
                <p>Aristide said he signed his prepared resignation, and then went off. And then
                    later said, “I was kidnapped.” Now, there is an already well-known use of the
                    word “kidnapped.” Now I don't understand why the ears of people didn't perk up
                    when they heard that word, “kidnap.” How inappropriate. I don't enter into the
                    question of whether he left willingly or not, whether he is a courageous person
                    or a coward, whether he accepted the invitation to leave or was carried onto the
                    airplane. I don't know. I wasn't there. Kidnapped? He was exiled. He was
                    banished. He was expelled. He was forced out. He was overturned. He was
                    humiliated. He was an awful lot of things, but he wasn't kidnapped. And nobody
                    said, “What is he talking about? Is he nuts?” No, he's kidnapped. Take it at
                    face value, kidnapped. This is a code word. You recognize it as a code word
                    because it stands out.</p>
                <p>When Aristide, after a visit abroad, comes home and congratulates the people who
                    were in his absence keeping the peace. When the people who were keeping the
                    peace, that is to say the so-called popular organizations, ruffians, his
                    hirelings, when they had just killed nine people in various raids... I mean,
                    wait a minute. Thank you very much. Keeping the peace? Well, peace is a code
                    word. It's used in a different way. Lavalas. Marvelous use of the word Lavalas.
                    Lavalas is the name of his movement. Lavalas in Creole is a flash flood. The
                    rain falls and there are no trees and there's no vegetation. It fills up a
                    ravine and rushes torrentially carrying everything before it. Nothing can
                    withstand it. And the next morning it leaves detritus in the streets. It leaves
                    behind a terrible mesdead dogs, dead cattle, dead babies, houses, doors,
                    garbage. That's a lavalas.</p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>How to turn that into something positive. He said he wanted to point out that the
                    people is an unstoppable force, but he gave it away, didn't he? He gave it away
                    for those who had ears to hear. Now, poor America, poor international communita
                    community of ignoranccouldn't understand that. It's not important. It's only
                    language. He says hell on earth is going to rain in Haiti. The toilets are going
                    to overflow, and it's going to leave a terrible mess. This is nihilism. Trouble
                    is on the way. That's what he said.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: “Ba-yo sa yo merite.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORTON: That's something else. That's understatement. That's not the coded word.
                    When he came back from the UN after insulting the Pope basically calling him a
                    racist and got wind of the coup d'�tat, which he didn't believe because Haitian
                    leaders seldom believe the worst. They believe that they're unmovable objects.
                    He gave a speech telling the people to be alert, that something is afoot and
                    ba-yo sa yo merite means “Give them what they deserve.” And then he went on into
                    a kind of ecstatic extolling of the order of burnt tires, how sweet a smell it
                    was. Okay. It's understatement. He's telling them to take charge of their
                    revolution and, if necessary, execute the enemies of the people with flaming
                    tires.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now there's a lot of controversy over that phrase. I think
                        that you either recorded it, or... There are some people who claimed he
                        never said it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORTON: Okay. I'll tell you one thing. First of all, he said it. I heard it. But
                    let me tell you, as forewarned as I was having been involved in Haitian affairs
                    since 1972 and then having lived and worked day after day in Haiti since 1986.
                    In 1991 when he gave that speecthat's 20 years after my venture into Haitian
                    affairwhen he gave that speech, I reported it. And I didn't give that sentence
                    in my report. I didn't say that he said, “Give them what they deserve. How sweet
                    is the odor of flaming tire necklaces,” because I didn't believe I had heard it.
                    I had censored myself unconsciously because I couldn't believe, literally, I
                    couldn't believe my ears. No, he could not have meant what he said. What did he
                    say, then? What did he mean? He didn't mean ba-yo sa yo merite was that the
                    enemies of the people deserve to be reeducated or something like that, that the
                    sweet smell is of church incense. He said what he meant. I couldn't believe my
                    ears. He was speaking unequivocally.</p>
                <p>Let's come back to ransom. I will come back to kidnapping because, for me, it is
                    his last masterpiecI'm not talking about his subsequent speeches on New Year's
                    Day which have been interpreted variouslI think it's just so perfect. So
                    perfect, first of all, because it's a code word. Second of all, because no one,
                    outside the circle of those it concerns, got it. Not his supporters, the Randall
                    Robinsons of this world. (Hazel Robinson, his wife, was on Aristide's payroll.)
                    In good faith or bad, defenders of Aristide behaved as though his use of the
                    word “kidnap” is in no way bizarre.</p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>To be kidnapped means what? Gangsters spirit you away. You are sequestered. A
                    ransom is demanded of those who care for you. A ransom is paid. If the ransom is
                    not paid, suffering will occur. If the leader identifies himself with Haiti, as
                    Aristide does and says so many times, who is kidnapped? What is kidnapped? Haiti
                    is kidnapped. And if its leader is not returned safely soon, suffering will
                    occur. How strange the rash of kidnappings that occurred after his “kidnapping.”
                    “I was kidnapped.” People who know how to listen hear. If you don't know how to
                    listen, you don't hear. Who cares? I tried in my Associated Press reports to
                    mention something about this double language. Nobody seems to have picked it
                    up.</p>
                <p>I was in Haiti from 1986, first a reporter for one of Haiti's main radio
                    stations. I had an evening program that began as, quite simply, a review of the
                    headlines for the English-speaking community that I translated from the
                    newsroom. I learned how to be a reporter there, and then I started getting
                    ambitious. And then I realized since it was 10 o'clock and the owners did not
                    mind, I could do whatever I wanted. And so I started thinking and I started
                    doing. And every night I broadcast what I called “The Evening Chronicle” where,
                    for 45 minutes or longer I just went on and on. I tied in all of the events of
                    the day and tried to explain what the political revolution in Haiti was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is a crucial part of this interviehow you developed
                        as a commentator, as an observer. Let's close the chapter on the theme of
                        double language. The question I've been wanting to ask: is it double or is
                        it multiple? Do Haitians understand this type of innuendo and do most
                        foreigners just misunderstand? Or is it the type of language that has a
                        multitude of different meanings even to Haitian listeners?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORTON: Remember what I said, I never know what the other person thinks because,
                    don't forget, this is a country under the shadow of slavery. Do slaves tell you
                    what they really think? Freed slaves tell you what they think when they have the
                    paranoiac, or not necessarily paranoiac, impression that slavery's going to be
                    re-imposed? When the country's militarized and there's no law and there's no
                    recourse for justice? When the truth leaves you vulnerable to the malignity of
                    your neighbor? Why should they tell you what they think? I used to get very
                    angry at my bosses who would come down and would walk with me and would say,
                    “Ask that woman what she thinks.” Why would she tell me what she thinks?</p>
                <p>So I don't know. I know that some of my friends agreed with me. Some of my
                    Haitian friends who, at that particular moment were transparent in their
                    discussion with me. Others were prudently quiet, which I interpreted as
                    agreement. Others no. And, so far as the international / donor nations are
                    concerned, they didn't get it at all.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The question is, did most or all Haitians get it when
                        these equivocal words were givethe word, “kidnapping,” the word, “I love the
                        smell of tires or the smell of...”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORTON: Again, what does it mean, “to get?” If somebody else is in the room while
                    I'm speaking to you and I say, “Get up,” and I look at you, you'll get up. The
                    other person will not get up. Does that mean that other person didn't get what I
                    said? Well, yes and no. I directed my words to you. When he said kidnapping, he
                    was speaking to his followers. He wasn't speaking to the people at large. He
                    wasn't speaking to people elsewhere. He figured cleverly enough that his
                    supporters abroad would take it as a colorful synonym for ousted, manhandled and
                    forcibly ousted.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now he said, “Please keep the peace,” when he went to

                </p>
                <p>NORTON: Absolutely to his followers. People didn't even pay attention to him by
                    the end.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you say people: outsiders?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORTON: No, in Haiti. The myth of Aristide's popularity is worth discussing, too.
                    Aristide was swept into power in a 1991 landslide. Unfortunately we don't know
                    how many people voted. I myself criticize myself for not perking up my ears
                    because I'm a formalist. When we get to talk about the Constitution, we can talk
                    about that. I was not faithful to my principles. I should not have said he was
                    elected. I should have said he was swept to power by a plebiscite. In an
                    election you count votes. An election respects the individual. Every vote
                    counts. It's not true in fact, but morally every vote counts. Every vote is
                    counted whether it counts or not. Every vote is counted. That means I, who cast
                    that ballot, count. I am a citizen like you. I'm poorer than you, but I'm just
                    like you. I'm equal. Hey, equality. And that gives us, at that moment, liberty.
                    Maybe not at other times but...OK. Not to count the ballots, not to be able to
                    count the ballots, is an infringement of my individual rights. To accept it
                    saying well, “You know, Haiti is a country that has no democratic tradition.
                    It's better than nothing, and he won, didn't he?” The American political
                    establishment was completely blind, deaf, dumb, blind, lame, quadriplegic,
                    lobotomized in 1991. They foresaw the victory of Marc Bazin, former World Bank
                    project officer, Mr. Clean, etc. He was really presentable.</p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>He was a priesAristide was not a parish prieshe was a priest, he was a Salesian
                    father who gave these fantastic sermonparticipative sermons. He was absolutely
                    spellbinding, with his gifted use of language. Unfortunately the United States
                    put their money on Bazin the way they put their money on the army in 1987, not
                    foreseeing for one moment that, hey, with the fall of Duvalier, you opened the
                    ports, you opened the floodgates. And you not only opened the doors of
                    prosperity, relative prosperity, but of hope, of a heretofore obstructed future.
                    Hope in a country that is oppressed means freedom. A country of slaves that has
                    been humiliated. You are opening Pandora's box. You don't want Pandora's box
                    opened.? Well, you don't get rid of Duvalier, or do something else. I don't
                    know. But if you do open Pandora's box, judge whether or not you can co-opt
                    whoever comes out. What was sad, tragic, pathetic was that it had been and would
                    have been possible to co-opt those fugitives from despair.</p>
                <p>There was nothing socialist, let alone communist, in the movement for Haitian
                    democracy. Nothing was more foreign to it. The Soviet Union was already going to
                    collapse. What was this fear? And so a normal transition from a dictator to a
                    dictatorial army formed, by the way, trained by the United States in the 19
                    years of its occupation on the model of the Marine Corps. These are the people
                    that are going to provide the transition to democracy? The Marines?</p>
                <p>Anyway, that was the American policy, of course. Warned as they were by some
                    journalists that the coup d'�tat reaction would occur in 1987, they didn't
                    listen. Or perhaps they didn't care. Or perhaps they didn't know. Or perhaps
                    they wanted it. I'm talking about the Americans. In 1991, it was a different
                    story. Aristide was a different kettle of fish, in my opinion. Also co-optable,
                    but you had to understand him. You had to want to understand him. Is it
                    important to understand if you formulate policy? They didn't understand. So,
                    Marc Bazin was going to win hands down.</p>
                <p>I remember Jimmy Carter coming down and he was worried because Aristide, after
                    all, was a rabble rouser. Now, Jimmy Carter believed, I believe, that Aristide
                    was losing, but that he had enough supporters to cause a great deal of damage to
                    the country. And in his own peanut farmer way, he went and talked to Aristide.
                    This was marvelous. This set up a belief that never disappeared. Because
                    Aristide interpreted Jimmy Carter's plea to him that he be peaceful. That when
                    he loses he not unleash the hordes. It was a plea. And Aristide, of course,
                    since every word is in a double language, took it as a threat. Nobody
                    understands anybody. I believe that Jimmy Carter spoke unequivocally. I believe
                    it was a plea. He had been misinformed. Aristide won. I will never forget that.
                    Thousands and thousands and hundreds of thousands of peoplpoor, middle class,
                    wealthy, black, not-so-black, mulatteverybody, almost everybody, voted for
                    Aristide in 1991 and it was clear why.</p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>Why wasn't it clear why to the Americans? You have to ask them, but I have two or
                    three ideas. Let's take the...without ascribing evil intentions. The U.S. comes
                    into a weird country. It's the other side of the looking glass. The sentence
                    does come before the trial. I mean, off goes their head. It really is that way.
                    Who's going to tell you the truth about such a country? What they call in French
                    interlocuteur valable. What would it be in English?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A credible interlocutor.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORTON: An “interlocutor” is a character in a minstrel show...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: An informant.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORTON: A credible one. So, who are credible informants? I'm an American. Simon
                    Pure. I go to talk to ministers of the protestant churches. I talk to bishops of
                    the Catholic church. I talk to leading representatives of the business
                    community, especially them. I talk to some politicians who present well, rub
                    shoulders with civilization. Americans abroad do not know who they are talking
                    to, because they do not know who they are. An American abroad is an American,
                    whatever his or her color. When you're in the United States, the diversity of
                    Americans is enormous. A black American is an American but he's quite different
                    from the Amish of Pennsylvania. You put an Amish in Haiti or a black American in
                    Haiti, they'd be the same. Haitians call foreigners blancs, white men. It
                    doesn't mean white color; it means foreigner. But it also means white. So what
                    you get in Haiti when you get, for example, an African American diplomat, is a
                    white black man.</p>
                <p>And I'll tell you a story later, the funniest one I remember, about a white black
                    man of renown. Who do you talk to to get a hold on this crazy country? We talk
                    to business people. Of course, these business people invested in Marc Bazin's
                    campaign. He was an absolute shoo-in. Now I covered the beginning of Marc
                    Bazin's campaign in 1991. I knew Marc Bazin personally.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You'd been sending material to the AP for how long?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORTON: Well, I began at AP with the coup d'�tat against Leslie “Margrat,”
                    remember? And then shortly after, I was with the BBC and gave these pundit
                    performances. But Toto Bissainthe was somebody and because of her, I knew
                    everybody. I knew many politicians already in Paris. People who became heads of
                    parties I already knew. I had relations with them, so I was introduced, I guess
                    as no other journalist was, I was introduced in the bourgeoisie, in the
                    political class, and since I chose to live in poor quarters, in slums, after the
                    death of Toto in 1994, I knew the people, too. I knew everybody. So...</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were covering...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORTON: Yah, the send-off of Bazin's campaign was another example, too, of this
                    other world we're talking abouthis Alice in Wonderland sort of thing. It was in
                    St. Marc, his hometown, I believe. There I was in the town square. There were so
                    few people, I said, “I'm not even going to cover this.” Bazin doesn't exist. A
                    buddy came up to me and said, “How many people do you think are here?” I said
                    two thousand, I don't know. People were hanging out of the windows. Do we call
                    them down “participants”? I don't know. They live here. Have they come to see
                    Marc Bazin? I was overheard, but before I left, just to make a test, I asked one
                    of Marc Bazin's supporters, “How many people do you see here? How many people
                    have turned up for the opening rally of Marc Bazin's presidential campaign?” He
                    looked around and said, “Seventeen thousand.”</p>
                <p>Okay. They were very mad at me. Marc Bazin didn't speak to me for a year and a
                    half because of that. I didn't even do an article on the rally. But the figure
                    got into the radio station where I used to work because of my buddy who asked me
                    how many people I saw there and because people trusted me.</p>
                <p>Another thing, I used to have this little gadget from Radio Shack because I used
                    to always measure. You press a button and it'll tell you how many meters to the
                    nearest wall. So what I would do is I would measure and then I would multiply by
                    the number of people I estimated per square meter. And when the reporters saw me
                    with this machine, they thought it was a counting machine. So they believed me
                    because I had the technology which could give them an exact figure. Eh?
                    Wonderland? Where objects are magical? Where numbers are emotional vehicles?
                    Numbers are alive? And if you say it's not 17,000, you are guilty of attempted
                    assassination.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you say two thousand?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORTON: I said two thousand, and my buddy picked it up. And other stations picked
                    it up, and, what do you know, it's two thousand. But they knew it was me because
                    they overheard me on the plaza because I was so silly, so na�ve, and I never
                    shut my mouth in Haiti, even during the coup d'�tat. I never shut my mouth. I
                    was fearless. I didn't care, but I did care. I was hurt, personally hurt. But I
                    was in Wonderland. How can you have any right to be personally hurt since your
                    person doesn't exist? You're different. It's different. You don't exist in the
                    same way. The last experience I had in Haiti was when Aristide was ousted for
                    the second time, and there were these demonstrations organized by the
                    bourgeoisie and utilizing students and pseudo students, etc.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're now in 2003, I think.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>NORTON: 2003 and 2004. Aristide was very repressive. There were clashes between
                    his thugs and this group of people. Their slogan to oust Aristide wait's
                    difficult to translate, but basicallgrenn nan bounda. The English equivalent
                    would be, “If you got balls, prove it.” I found that not charming. Aristide had
                    perverted the hopes of the Haitian people into a racket to keep them in poverty
                    and to enrich his buddies and himself. He was an obscurantist. He sat on the
                    throne of truth and he used it as a cuckstool, if you know what that is. That's
                    the worst you can do. That is evil. He enjoyed the suffering of others. That is
                    evil, for evil is not doing my pleasure. It's preventing you from enjoying
                    yours. And that's what Aristide did. That's why he was evil. Evil. He perverted
                    the last, best hope of Haiti. “If you've got balls, prove it.” I thought that it
                    was necessary to oust him. He was not an elected president in the year 2000 as
                    he was in the year 1991. The elections were basically controlled. He lied about
                    the results. He was an illegitimate president. There was no reason not to oust
                    and it was necessary for the political health of the body politic to oust this
                    poison but not “if you've got balls, prove it.” I found...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was the slogan of those who sought to oust him.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORTON: Exactly, my friends thought...my friends...I didn't have any friends by
                    now. By now I had lost almost all of my friends because there was unanimity for
                    Aristide in 1991 in spite of his very early deviation from the Constitution. I
                    protested on television. I don't know what gave me the idea of doing that, but I
                    was one of five or six people who criticized Aristide publicly. Everybody was
                    afraid before the coup d'�tat. All of the others were for the coup d'�tat. I was
                    the only one who wasn't because he was elected. There were other ways to do it.
                    Aristide was furious with me. It was only the intervention of my friend and
                    sponsor, Antoine Izmery, that saved my neck in Haiti.</p>
                <p>So in the year 2003 and 2004, I thought that the repression in Haiti required
                    something else, not “if you've got balls, prove it.” It's just violence. It's
                    just machismo. And at times the students were as violent as the others. It was
                    violence, violence, violence when the only thing that can save Haiti is respect
                    for the law and respect for the individual. Violence, violence, violence.</p>
                <p>Okay, so get rid of them and do what? Are you prepared? Are you better prepared
                    than your predecessors to turn this miserable savanna desert into an inhabitable
                    region of the earth? Are you prepared? Do you know a way to bring hope to these
                    people which is not founded, as Aristide's was, on thievery? One thing often
                    forgotten by Aristide's defenders: Aristide supported the pyramidal scheme of
                    banking which destroyed the savings of I don't know how many millions of people
                    and filled the coffers of people who knew enough to get out soon. Aristide, from
                    the presidential chair, supported this.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: 2002, I think.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>NORTON: Yah. So I lost their friendship. And what really sealed it, of course,
                    first of all, I was opposed to Aristide in 1991 and everybody who was in favor
                    of Aristide believed I was for the coup d'�tat. And then during the coup d'�tat,
                    since I reported faithfully all of the misadventures of the army, the army
                    thought I was trying to get them ousted. Because I'm not just a reporter. I'm a
                    political activist. But, in fact, when I came to Haiti, I didn't have to be a
                    political activist. All I had to do was tell the truth. Every enunciation was a
                    denunciation. All I had to do was say how things were. That's what I did. So
                    Aristide believed I had sold out to the military. The military believed I had
                    sold out to Aristide. It was not too pleasant, but the taboos that maintained a
                    certain cultural order prevented me from getting killed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And the count of the people...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORTON; So I come back. Now, we're going to get rid of Aristide. And then I
                    didn't quite agree with the grenn nan bounda, “If you've got balls, show it.” I
                    started counting the demonstrators. Now I know how to estimate the size of a
                    demonstration. You take the number of people per square meter, which varies
                    depending on how fast they're moving. If they're standing still, it can be two,
                    three even if it's really like in an elevator. Generally, most police forces in
                    the world will tell you that it's one and a half person per square meter, and
                    you multiply that by the square meters of the distance traveled. I mean at any
                    one time. How long is and how wide is the demonstration and then you get a
                    figure. And then if it's two thousand five hundred, you say around two thousand
                    five hundred. Now, when I said it was around two thousand five hundred, they
                    said it was around sixty thousand. And since I was the AP and I was the BBC and
                    I was the most read reporter in Haiti, most widely read, it went from bad to
                    worse. Finally, I would stand on the street corner as the demonstration went by
                    and count them one by one. And, of course, it was like running the gauntlet
                    standing still. They were running but I was receiving the gauntlet. Death
                    threats, insults, spat upon, pushed. It was an experience that was at one and
                    the same time the most inglorious and glorious I had in Haiti. I was a hero and
                    nobody knew it except me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In favor of what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORTON: The Republic cannot exist without truth. There is no human betterment
                    without respect for the truth. Without striving for the truth, you cannot strive
                    for the betterment of man. In a society of lies, of violence, of inherited
                    inferiority where everybody is suffering from post traumatic stress syndrome,
                    face the truth, tell the truth no matter what the cost. The republic needs the
                    truth. It will flounder without the truth.</p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>And so, that was my own. Of course, it's completely romantic or idealistic,
                    however, I don't know. You can call it what you want, but for me, I was
                    defending the last sputtering wick, the dream of a Haitian republic. Of course,
                    what happened? As every time, when Aristide fell, a new regime took over.
                    Corrupwith the worst elements from all the past regimes. Of course. Corrupt,
                    violent, no justice, no prosperity, nothing, no prospects. And then along came
                    Pr�val and that's another story.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Fifteen years previous, you described yourself as a
                        political activist. You had certain objectives. You transformed into another
                        type of person or creature. If I understand, you did not do what you did in
                        the name of activism but truth. Were your objectives the same?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORTON: Yes, I think so. Of course, the anti-capitalist struggle was a pretty big
                    thing and it was another ambition which was absolutely unrealizable. And I was a
                    Westerner. I didn't feel bad about participating in French politics. I didn't
                    feel bad about that. It's the same capitalism. But in Haiti, Haiti's on another
                    planet almost. It has its own specificity; but, also, Haiti is in the
                    avant-garde of the capitalist disaster, a dump for the superfluous, the
                    unwanted, its soil and its soul eroded. How could I be a political activist? It
                    didn't make any sense, accord with my former understanding of political
                    activism. I was a political activist for what I call the republic or the
                    political revolution of Haiti, yes, but all I had to do was tell the truth. I
                    didn't have to take arms or paste posters or propagandize for a party. I didn't
                    have the inclination either. All I had to do was report.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you say you were opposed to capitalism, the reader of
                        this text will form some impressions. They will have a sense of what that

                </p>
                <p>NORTON: Sure. Look, it's the system that governs, and has governed, the world for
                    hundreds and hundreds of years. In my opinion, communist China, communist
                    Russia, Stalinist Russia were variants of capitalism. Capitalism tried them out
                    and found them wanting. Same with fascism. Tried it out and found it wanting.
                    Imperialism still remains. Colonialism still remains. They're still working. The
                    limits which capitalism doesn't recognize are not causing capitalism to collapse
                    because of global warming. Not yet. Capitalism is the economic, social,
                    political, cultural system that reigns, and it secures security for the rich and
                    insecurity for the impoverished and the impoverishable.</p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>Capitalism lays waste to old worlds to build a new world in its image. It lays
                    waste to lives, it produces mass migrations, a dead end for millions, garbage
                    dumps. In our day, the truly Utopian demand, a demand the system cannot satisfy,
                    would be full employment. The insecurity in the United States is a case in
                    point. The job insecurity is terrible in the United States. 47 million people
                    don't have health insurance. What is this? Katrina destroys a city of over a
                    million people and it's still in ruins? Capitalism is for the profit of the few.
                    It's private ownership of the public means of production. That's what it is.
                    It's exploitation. Everybody knows what it means to be exploited. For the
                    moment, we seem to have no alternative. We have certain ways of diminishing its
                    negative aspects. Perhaps, I don't know, we can never get beyond that. Perhaps
                    we can never move into a world system where exploitation will not be the rule,
                    where private ownership will only be of private things. Perhaps not, I don't
                    know. It's too big of a question for me, but I bet on it: it is my secular
                    version of Pascal's wager. Why else should I give this interview?.</p>

                        observer become involved in those events or separate?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORTON: Well, in Haiti, it was really most special because I had a calling card.
                    I was the representative of The Associated Press and BBC in Haiti, the two
                    biggest news-gathering organizations in the world. I was somebody. Wow. One
                    time, we were threatenethe news wire serviceof being expelled. Once. Called in
                    by the information minister. I think it was during the coup d'�tat. Fuck you,
                    basically we said. I didn't care. I knew they wouldn't do it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do what? Take you do the airport?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORTON: Yah, because it'd be worse. I mean it'd be worse for them. And at least
                    they knew who I was. And they knew I was fair even though they didn't like it.
                    You're implicated in events when you're reporting. I was there at the massacres.
                    I was shot at. Nobody could tell me bullets weren't flying because they shot at
                    me. Nobody could tell me that it wasn't true. I was there. I talked to the
                    people. I talked to the army. I had contacts all ovein the army, among the
                    thugs, among the killers, among the victims. I was everywhere. I tried to be
                    everywhere. I felt the extremities of the country in my fingers and my toes. I
                    was there. I was implicated. And I spoke. And I wrote it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was anybody not a thug?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORTON; Yah, a lot of decent people.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any political formations who were not
                        thugs?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORTON: Yah, yah, but they all had a tendency. I'm not talking about individuals;
                    I'm talking about the political parties. They all had a tendency to thugdom
                    because none of them really respected the Constitution. By respecting the
                    Constitution, that is respect the idea of the Constitution. You have to have law
                    and order. Haiti was the only place I have ever been where law and order was a
                    left-wing demand, not a right-wing one as it usually is. Law and order, respect
                    the individual, respect his rights, follow the rules, let them be transparent,
                    let them be posted, and let those who infringe be punished. Is that so hard to
                    understand? I was there. I was everywhere. I was implicated in all the events
                    because I wrote about them every day. I made Haiti known to the world for almost
                    twenty years. I was able.</p>
                <p>I was finally evacuated from Haiti because of bad health. We can come back to
                    that and talk about the American embassy. And I had sources in the national
                    palace. I was evacuated to the hospital in Jamaica. From Jamaica, I called the
                    office to tell them that Aristide was being ousted. I did. Two hours before
                    anyone else. That's how embedded I was in reality. To be a reporter in a
                    country, you have to be embedded in the country. You cannot come in and find
                    your credible informants. You can't. It's an art. It's not so much a science.
                    You feel the country or you don't feel the country. You know you can trust this
                    person and you can't trust that. You feel that something bad is coming or you
                    don't feel it. Now, there is a slight decline in insecurity in Haiti. I know how
                    it works. The editor says, “What can we say about Haiti today? I have to say
                    something.” “Well, there is a slight decline.” “Oh, Okay!” “Haitians breathe
                    free after two years of violence,” headline.</p>
                <p>Come on now. You don't understand the country if you believe that headline.
                    Thugdom takes a breather. Thugs take a breather. They go underground. They wait
                    until, you know, the heat's off and then they come back because the causes of
                    their thuggery have not been eradicated. Why should the thugs be eradicated?
                    Sure, they lose some of their people, but the number of thugs is legion in Haiti
                    because despair and desperation and despondency are deep and deepening, because
                    the traditional value system has been knocked out of whack. That's the kind of
                    news you get out of Haiti. Haitians breathe free after two years, etc. And the
                    U.N. applauds itself. They've done it. They have done it. They have caused the
                    respite, thank goodness. But it's a respite. Nothing has been done in Haiti to
                    change its destiny, which is self-destruction, annihilation. Aristide was a
                    nihilist. He wanted his country poor. He told an Inter-American Development Bank
                    representative, “Please Sir, don't take away our poverty. It's our dignity.”
                    Quote unquote. “Please, Sir. Do not take away our poverty. It is our dignity. It
                    is our strength.”</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When observing events, did it sometimes happen that you
                        wished for an outcome other than the one that you saw? And if so, what was
                        happening inside you as a professional? Example: in counting the people on
                        the streets, you gave an accurate count. Would you have wished on that day
                        that those who said sixty thousand had been correct?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORTON: I guess this will tie into your other question. My implication. It's true
                    I wasn't a journalist like other journalists. There was a certain militant
                    aspect to me. I talked to people. I tried to reason with them. I mean, I gave my
                    point of view. You're not supposed to do that, are you? To give your point of
                    view. I talked to leaders and said, “What the hell is this? 'You've got balls,
                    prove it.' This has to have dignity. This has to have meaning. This has to have
                    a future.”</p>
                <p>“You've got balls, prove it” doesn't mean anything. I would talk. It didn't
                    affect my reporting. I would like to believe so. I mean, who knows. Listening to
                    my voice on this interview, I don't recognize it, so maybe I'm deluding myself.
                    I would talk to everybody. I talked to everybody, and to the extent that I
                    thought there was a possibility to be heard, I would give my opinion. And my
                    reason, not my opinion. I hate opinions. You have an argument. You have a reason
                    to believe what you believe. If you have reason to believe what you believe,
                    it's not an opinion.</p>
                <p>I believe that Mitt Romney will be the candidate. Why do I believe that? It's an
                    opinion. I have no idea why I believe that. Maybe because he's a corporate man,
                    because he looks clean, because he hasn't made any extraordinary mistakes. Maybe
                    if I look, I could justify that but that's just rationalization. It's an
                    opinion. If I give a reason, if I say, for example, there's no fundamental
                    difference between Mitt Romney and Hillary Clinton, you better expect an
                    argument. You better expect an argument concerning the nature of political
                    parties in the United States, etc. That would not be an opinion. What do you
                    call it?</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You gave arguments to Haitian individuals.</hi>

                <p>NORTON: Yah, that is one of the beautiful examples of, again, American innocence,
                    American ignorance, American indifference abroad. Haiti is a small country.
                    Haiti is, to those of us who care about the human spirit, who know what we mean
                    when we say the human spirit, Haiti is a monument. Haiti is Mt. Everest because
                    it is a landmark in the conquest of human liberty and human equality.</p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>Geopolitically, what is it? There are carpetbaggers who come down to Haiti, and
                    some of them with connections to well-known politicians, well-known groups of
                    politicians. There's money to be made in Haiti, obviously. There's money to be
                    made everywhere. I don't know. Can you sell air conditioners in hell? I don't
                    know. I suppose there's somebody who can. Or, I don't know, flaming charcoal
                    briquettes exported from hell ready to cook your beef in Texas? There's not much
                    economic interest in Haiti, geopolitical interest, obviously. Stability of the
                    region. Haiti is part of Hispa�ola. Eight million people in Haiti, eight
                    million, maybe more...sixteen million people in Hispa�ola. That's a hell of a
                    lot of people. That's the Dominican Republic and then you've got Jamaica and
                    then, wow, Cuba. What about Cuba? Where's it going? You never know. And then
                    there are more and more Haitians in the United States. That's a political
                    factor. I mean, one of these days they'll get their act together and, like the
                    Cubans, they'll start voting. They've already got a couple of elected officials
                    in local offices. It'll come. It'll come. Haitians are smart, hard working.</p>
                <p>Haiti is small, but it has geopolitical interest. It's in America's backyard. Its
                    presence...you know, it's like somebody who doesn't cut the lawn. If it's your
                    neighbor, you're going to catch all that ragweed. Haiti, to be precise, is a
                    pain in the ass. And the problem, I think, with the United States is they try to
                    solve it with containment - coast guard sending back the refugees. It's not a
                    threat, in my opinion, but they send them back anyways. If they open the
                    floodgates, of course there would be but...they send them back. Then there's the
                    U.N. who'll stay there and provide an exoskeleton of security, contain the
                    insecurity. The problem with that is you can limit the pain, but you can't make
                    it go away. It's your ass, and it's your pain. It's less of a pain than in Haiti
                    because they're the ones who are suffering, but it is your ass and you've got to
                    cover it. Is what's going on in Haiti the way to cover the ass of the United
                    States and the Caribbean? I do not think so.</p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>I think there never was any danger of a communist takeover in Haiti. There was
                    never any danger of a radical movement taking hold of power. Aristide was never
                    a socialist, much less a communist. Aristide was an upstart who wanted to enrich
                    himself and his cronies in order to be somebody. Poor guy with his inferiority
                    complex and his manic depression. I once heard him name-dropping, not quoting,
                    Plato and Aristotle in a talk with peasants. In one speech at the National
                    Palace, he called Heidegger “the philosopher of peace.” Pompous. Gifted, but not
                    gifted to be president. Insincere, hypocritical, violent. Violent. Selfish. The
                    antithesis of the democratic republican leader. He was not interested in
                    economic development. If you're interested in economic development, you're like
                    Castro, right? You've got a socialist/communist party. He developed with the
                    means at hand an economy. If you don't, you don't stay in power. It's not the
                    problem with Aristide. Proof of the pudding is his support of the pyramid
                    scheme. I remember poor people coming to my house and asking my opinion on the
                    pyramidal banking scheme. They said, “But it's supported by the president. I'm
                    putting all my money into it.” They lost all their money. Economic development
                    is not a problem for the heirs of the heirs of the French masters of slaves.
                    Imitate the master. It's an imitation of the master. To be an imitation, you
                    have to have slaves, but real slaves, menials, mental slaves. That was Aristide.
                    Why was I going into that? You have to understand this.</p>
                <p>Down comes a well-meaning former ambassador. It was in 1991, a couple of months
                    before the ouster of Aristide, and I accompanied Mr. Andrew Young on a small
                    plane to Cap-Haitien. Andrew Young was making rounds, spreading the word of the
                    Lord. And here I am between Andrew Young, charming fellow, and a much less
                    charming fellow, Colonel Valmond, commander of the garrison in Cap-Haitien which
                    is Haiti's second largest city. And here you have the perky, bright former
                    ambassador talking to this sandbag, expressionless but very polite. Because here
                    we've got Andrew Young. Now Andrew Young doesn't know that he's a white man. But
                    Valmond is listening to a white man speak to him about the virtues of democracy.
                    So he delivered the sermon on the virtues of democracy, how the country
                    progresses when everybody rallies around the flag, the role of the military is,
                    we have an elected president, you have a Constitutional duty, you have a
                    Constitutional prerogative... End of sermon.</p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>I liked Andrew Young and, I don't know, I couldn't take it. Andrew Young seemed
                    like somebody I could talk to. Of course, I was wrong, but what the hell. I
                    said, “Mr. Young, I sat and listened to you for five, ten minutes, and I can't
                    believe such an intelligent man could be so silly. You were talking to a thug.
                    Do you think for one minute that he takes you seriously? You? A big shot white
                    man from up north? They're going to stage a coup d'�tat when they goddamn well
                    feel like it, and you're not going to stop them with these blowhard words.” He
                    didn't throw me out of the plane on the way back. I was on very good terms with
                    Alvin Adams who was the ambassador during the coup d'�tat, and I very often got
                    together with him and we chewed the fat and I irritated him. But I loved him
                    because he was so smart. And we got along fine. Was he in on the coup d'�tat?
                    How was the coup d'�tat staged? Very complicated questions. What was the role of
                    the United States in the coup d'�tat? I think there was a role, but it wasn't
                    simple and we can come back to that. The Company is one thing, and the State
                    Department is another. Maybe they act together; maybe they don't. It's never
                    clear, and why should it be clear? It's much better to be confusing. Nobody
                    knows what everybody else is doing. Nobody knows everything. It is often
                    convenient for the left hand not to know the right.</p>
                <p>The Haitians had the green light to oust Aristide at the end of September 1991.
                    The army took the ball, ran, and ran, made the touchdown, and kept running. And
                    wouldn't give up the ball. Three years later, the Americans had to put their
                    foot down and say, “Stooge! You're a stooge! Don't you remember? Stooge.”
                    Haitians are not stupid. “Yes, Massa,” and then they slit your fucking throat at
                    night. That's the tradition. That's the people you're dealing with. “Yes,
                    Massa,” and at night they slit your throat. Got it?</p>
                <p>And Alvin said to me, “Mike” — he liked to pull my leg — “You know what
                    Ambassador Young said about you on his trip to Haiti? You're the most cynical
                    guy he met in Haiti.”</p>
                <p>Needless to say, two or three months later in 1991, the coup d'�tat had taken
                    place. I don't remember when Andrew Young came back to Haiti, but he didn't
                    reject me. He was very nice to me, and his staff was very nice to me. Of course,
                    he didn't say, “Hey, what'd I miss?” Innocent, ignorant, or indifferent? Please
                    tell me. I don't know. The unequivocal language of those who represent western
                    civilization. I don't know what politicians are getting at. Nobody does. I think
                    history plays through them. They do things, and they don't really examine their
                    behavior. Not the way we would like. I mean, they rack their consciences, but do
                    they strain their brains? Why did the United States miss the peaceful intentions
                    of the Haitian people after Jean-Claude Duvalier was ousted? Why did they put
                    the future of the Haitian democracy in the hands of the military? Why did they
                    not see that Aristide was a shoo-in as president and get to work immediately
                    figuring out how they could reach this guy. Figure out, really, what he wanted.
                    Not the prosperity of the masses, a fair deal, down with the bourgeoisie... My
                    foot, he married into the bourgeoisie. My foot, he could have been bought out.
                    Cynical? I don't know. Did they figure it out? No, he was going to lose. That's
                    very comforting.</p>
                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>And then he had something against the Americans. From the beginning, they were
                    threatening him. They don't want him in. They were going to get rid of him, he
                    believed. And then, of course, the coup d'�tat. And then the uncertainty. What
                    was the U.S. going to do with him? Bush, the father, I think cut off the
                    resources, the Bank of the Republic resources in New York. There was a gasoline
                    embargo of sorts. Aristide pushed for a full embargo. His supporters said the
                    embargo now is doing nothing. In fact, it's destroying the country. I went out
                    into the countryside when the embargo began, and I didn't know what I would
                    find. I found that the small jobs in the city had been lost and that the
                    contribution to the countryside which was to finance repairs for irrigation
                    pipes and things like that were no longer coming. And therefore the whole tissue
                    of economic life was being rent by this incomplete embargo, and what Aristide
                    was going for was a complete embargo. And when I told a “friend,” a radical
                    priest. The whole priesthood was behind Aristide. Not for religious reasons, I
                    can tell you that. We can talk about the theology of liberation in Haiti, if you
                    like. When I told him, it was like, “Hey Father, I went out to the countryside
                    and this is what I found. It's hurting.” He said, “It's not true.”</p>
                <p>I said, “But listen to me...” He said, “It's not true. It's not true.” And that
                    was the end of our relationship. I never spoke to him again. And that was the
                    end of my relationship with the radical priesthood in Haiti because their boy
                    came to powepower hungry pigs. I repeat, power hungry pigs, not priests. Not
                    people who care about the souls of their parishioners, their well-being, their
                    happiness, their felicity. Power hungry pigs. They eat. They eat anything. And
                    Aristide places priests and former priests all over the state and parastatal
                    apparatus. And then those who have not been invited to the banquet break with
                    him. In Latin America, Liberation Theology aimed at the disestablishment of the
                    Catholic Church. It celebrated a homecoming, the return of the Church to the
                    fold, to the people, most of whom are poor. It was an attempt to purify a church
                    that had been contaminated by power, in particular the power of military
                    dictatorships. In Haiti, it aimed at the establishment of one faction of a
                    highly politicized Catholic Church, the anti-hierarchical faction, in the halls
                    of power. But Aristide was no theologian. He used everybody, politicians and
                    priests alike. He kept some people around him, many of them involved in the drug
                    trade or in privileged public-private business deals. But the big social
                    categories he lost. He finally lost them all. He lost the intellectuals. He lost
                    the bourgeoisie. He lost the towns and the countryside. He lost everybody except
                    his thugs at the end. One of the priests was the brother of a prime minister
                    under Pr�val. An enemy of the Aristidians. The prime minister's brother
                    officiated at the wedding of Aristide and a Washington or New York
                    Haitian-American lawyer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Mildred.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                <p>NORTON: Mildred. It was a January...I don't remember what year it was...and I
                    covered it at his mansion outside of Port-au-Prince. The estate, the mansion was
                    not a glorious affair. It doesn't compare with anything in Scarsdale, but it's
                    an enormous estate. I don't know how manten, twenty acres. And there's a
                    swimming pool. He ran a kind of orphanagran or misran imilked charitable
                    organizations for his own...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Aristide Foundation, by the way.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORTON: Yah, but the orphanage itself was called Fanmi Selav“The Family is Life.”
                    Incidentally there was no mother, and one father: Aristide. To read between the
                    lines, Aristide is the Staff of Life. And then he dropped it when it no longer
                    served his purposes.</p>
                <p>Look, I was with Aristide at the Family is Life center when the president of the
                    electoral panel announced his 1990 presidential victory on television. I was
                    standing. He was sitting on a bench, hands folded, looking for all the world
                    like a virgin on her wedding night. He looked up at me and said, “You're not
                    moved.” I was dumbfounded, flabbergasted. For, in fact, until he opened his
                    mouth, I had been exhilarated. The battle was on! The confrontation with Haiti's
                    retrograde forces was inevitable. And this poseur was the guy who was going to
                    lead the future to triumph over the past?</p>
                <p>Back to the marriage: strains of the “Blue Danube.” This is Haitian authenticity!
                    The strains of the “Blue Danube,” and then we were there. And then he got
                    married. Poor Mildred kept casting a glance over at him. The guy was cold,
                    frozen stiff. You know, never a touch, never a look of affection. I felt sorry
                    for her. I said, “What's going on? This is a State wedding.” This is a State
                    wedding, of a dark-skinned man and a light-skinned woman. And then came the
                    sermon because people were saying, “Eh, she's a mulatta.” “Oh, she's from the
                    bourgeoisie and Aristide is no longer with us.” The people. That was a rumor.
                    And this smarmy guy said, “It's not true. Aristide has married the Haitian
                    people, will never divorce the Haitian people.” This guy broke with him a couple
                    of months later, obviously, but he gave one last shot at power. Never did he
                    give an auto-, a self-criticism. Nobody ever gave a self-criticism. Nobody ever
                    said, “I was wrong about Aristide because I was blind to X, and I was blind to X
                    because I....” Magical. One moment I'm for him, the next minute I'm against him.
                    No. Crazy, crazy excuses. “I thought he would do the trick and then he didn't.”
                    I said, “But Jesus Christ, you look into his eyes, if you can. Listen to his
                    voice. Everything about him is phony. He's a wooden nickel. It's so obvious. Why
                    don't you look at people?” People don't look at people. Categorizing people
                    stands in the way of recognizing their individuality. People situate other
                    people socially, and that situation is their identity.</p>
                <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                <p>So, how to understand Haiti? You have to understand all of this. You have to
                    understand its cultural differences. You do not situate, and you do not identify
                    the way Haitians do. You have to understand that you don't have a credible
                    informant group. Groups are investments of interest. You have credible
                    informants, but no group will give you a credible picture, a disinterested
                    picture. And you have to weave something out of this. Now, should I go on with
                    this theme? Should I tell you about my meeting with the DCM after Alvin
                    left?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sure. Maybe the DCM story first. That's a very important
                        story. But I also wanted to ask, though, can you give a sense in maybe this
                        interview or the next one: how did the American embassy do throughout this
                        period? Were there any individuals or periods of time where the embassy
                        seemed to have more understanding of the situation and others really didn't?
                        Or were they uniformly misled? But please tell the story of the DCthe deputy
                        chief of mission.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORTON: It depended on the period. I found the ambassadors I had to deal with,
                    especially Carney and Curran, open. We had very good relations. They listened to
                    me. I don't think they were condescending, but they did not... I think they had
                    difficulties with me because I had a very high reputation, but my point of view
                    was basically that you're trying to force this democracy on Haiti and you're not
                    going to succeed. You don't even know who these people are that you're trying to
                    force something on. It's not even democracy that you're trying to force on them.
                    You want them to be good little boys, and they're not good little boys. Haitian
                    democracy is possible, but not on these terms. The investments in Haiti are
                    wrong. The infrastructure development is wrong. You have to think of a different
                    way of developing the economy of Haiti that is for the economy of Haiti. Sure,
                    you may make more money when you have all these construction projects and you
                    can get the money siphoned back to the United States and to the other countries
                    that have these companies doing the infrastructure, but, hey, it doesn't cost
                    very much. It's a small country. You can do a hell of a lot of good. There are a
                    lot of Americans here who want to do good. Get your thinking straight.</p>
                <p>Now, straight with respect to what? With the development of Haiti? Never that
                    easy. It's always a jumble. You're suddenly altruistiin the short term
                    altruistic and in the long term you'll reap the benefit. That's what I believe.
                    Just do it for a while. You know? There are a lot of bright people here. There's
                    a lot of good will. In the embassy, out of the embassy, a lot of foreigners come
                    down to Haiti. They love the country, and it breaks their hearts. They become
                    attached to it in ways that change their lives. It's a marvelous country. Be
                    altruistic for a while. Think it through. You want some people you can talk to?
                    I can tell you who you can talk to. But that's not the kind of talk they really
                    wanted to have.</p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>Then, after 2000 when it was obvious that the legislature was a rigged
                    legislature and that Aristide was not a legitimate president, there were all
                    kinds of problems trying to come to some agreement so that Haiti could function.
                    And then you had the OAS sending 1, 2, 13, 14, 20, 25, 26 delegations headed by
                    Luigi Einaudi coming to Haiti. I remember the last time I saw Einaudi, I think
                    it was one of his least successful, one of his last missions. We were walking
                    together, and I was saying something to him. He was walking by and it was at the
                    hotel, and suddenly a vase, nobody touched it, suddenly a vase tipped over and
                    fell.</p>
                <p>I said, “Mister Einaudi, Haiti. You're never going to reach your goal.” If it was
                    the real goal. I think it was a fa�ade. Let's get an agreement out of this. Come
                    on. I'm sick of this pain in my ass. Get an agreement. I said to them, and to
                    everybody I saw, “It will never happen.” Why it will never happen I explained.
                    I've given some of the reasons already. You don't understand these people. It's
                    all or nothing. It's spit in the soup. You can't deal with them this way. It is
                    just so much shucking and jiving. Do you understand shucking and jiving? No,
                    they're white people. They don't know what it is. And if they're black people,
                    they don't know what it is either because they're not in the United States, so
                    they've forgotten what it's like to be invisible and to become visible by
                    adopting the other person's image. So anyways, that was the standard spiel for a
                    long time with variations depending on the event or the moment. Okay, the DCM. I
                    think it was when Alvin Adams left and there was a period before I think Carney
                    came in, I can't remember.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Leslie Alexander.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORTON: Leslie Alexander was the ambassador.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Charg�.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORTON: Well. maybe he was charg� before Leslie was charg�, I can't remember.
                    Anyways, he was a Vietnam War herbronze star, piloand he was bald and very, very
                    clean. And he would go on to become a negotiator in what I believe then was
                    still Yugoslavia. It was falling apart and he would negotiate. Anyways, my
                    friend at the embassy, the public diplomacy officer - a very nice fellow, we
                    were on very good terms, he respected my opiniothought it would be a good idea
                    for us to meet. I very often had these conversations with incoming diplomats.
                    They would come and they would pick my brains, and then, of course, I would
                    feel, “Oh, I'm so important.” And then not feel so important after all. Anyways,
                    I was very important and gave my very important spiel to this very important
                    man. At one point, it was at the Oloffson Hotel, the scene of Graham Greene's
                    racist book The Comedians. So there we were eating bad food.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We: you and the...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>NORTON: Me, the public affairs officer, and the DCM.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Deputy chief of mission.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORTON: Exactly. And there we were eating away. Me talking, more than eating. I
                    prefer talking to eating. That's why I love radio more than anything else. At
                    one moment, I noticed he was looking. I don't know if he was looking at a woman.
                    His eyes were not making contact, and I said, “I have the impression that what
                    I'm saying really doesn't interest you. Maybe we should just eat and forget
                    about this. I came as a duty.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you telling him?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORTON: I don't know what it was I was telling him, but something like this.
                    Basically my spiel for all incoming diplomats was, “Consider the country. You
                    are going through the looking glass. These are the rules. They are not our
                    rules. You got a different kind of people with different relations from the ones
                    we are familiar with. It is, however, possible to establish democracy on this
                    basis if, if, if...” Basically it was that with examples drawn from the
                    particular crisis of the moment. I gave you one when the negotiation was under
                    way. Haitians do not negotiate. They kill. I don't agree with you. Boom. Or they
                    slander you or they defame you. I suffered that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So the DCM said what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORTON: I said, “Look, so why don't we just eat. I mean, I came here as a duty.”
                    And that's trua duty. I didn't believe it. I never believed that whatever I said
                    to dozens of diplomats and foreign visitors and State Department officials would
                    ever do any good. I never believed it, but God, I tried. I tried to be
                    convincing. I tried to be circumstantial. I tried to be precise and logical and
                    coherent. I think I was. I think I was. “Don't you think,” I asked the DCM of
                    the day eating his soup of the day, “Don't you think it's important to
                    understand a situation if you want to act in it and on it?” And he said, over
                    his soupe du jour, “No. I have a mission.”</p>
                <p>For some reason, I didn't stop talking to diplomats after that. I should have.
                    No, I shouldn't have. No. I kept on. I kept on doing it because I did sharpen my
                    analytical skills. And my spiel became better and better and better as the
                    months and the years wore on. I think I became more and more convincing. I mean,
                    foreign Aristide observers were somewhat shaken up when they met me. Because I
                    was supposed to be, according to the more idiotic of my critics, the “embedded
                    shill” of the American embassy. That's nice.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Many journalists came to Haiti knowing much less than you
                        did, and their first stop is to you.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORTON: Yah.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why did you share all of your information with them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORTON: Every bit of information, everything I had and some I couldn't use
                    because of security reasonI gave everything to everybody because I was not in
                    the business of journalism. Journalism was not my profession. I was busy being a
                    hero. I was on an extraordinary adventure, and my goal was to contribute a
                    little bit to the betterment of a people I loved. That's all. I turned out to be
                    a pretty good journalist, I think. I was, I think, an extraordinary journalist.
                    A remarkable journalist. But I didn't give a damn about it, and so I don't miss
                    it at all. I cared about Haiti, did and still do, without missing it.</p>
                <p>When I left Haiti, I became an editor at the central desk. I hated ihated every
                    minute of it. It's not reporting. An edited AP story is as formal as a sonnet,
                    in length and obligatory elements, like personalization and points of view that
                    neutralize each other and produce what is called objectivity. I did reporting in
                    Aruba, but you see, from the sublime to the ridiculous, I covered the Natalie
                    Holloway case. You know about Natalie Holloway because I wrote about her. Well,
                    the television coverage was overwhelming, but so far as the printed media, I was
                    on top of it first. And I stayed on top of it. I was a pretty good reporter, but
                    I didn't care. I didn't have a profession. I am somebody who will die without
                    having had a profession. I have a vocation. I'm a poet. That's what I've never
                    been unfaithful to. I've never gone without a day writing for forty years.
                    Thinking, writing, dreaming, misunderstanding, being confused, revisinall of
                    those things that make writing such an adventure.</p>
                <p>I was profoundly committed to the Haitian adventure because it was my adventure
                    in my imagination. Because it was up from slavery. Because I identified with the
                    Hebrews who left Egypt behind and wandered, or were led to Mt. Sinai and then
                    were found unworthy of the tablets of the law and then were forced to wander in
                    the desert until they came to the land flowing in milk and honey.</p>
                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>And then the horror of history. But I told Ambassador Curran when I first met hiI
                    think he misunderstood mthat there are two books that he should read if he wants
                    to understand Haiti: one is Alice in Wonderland, and the other is Exodus (not
                    the popular novel by Leon Uris, but Exodus in the Bible). There you have a
                    portrait of a slave revolution, and the lessons are clear: if you do not obey
                    the law, if you do not shape up, if you do not break off all relations with
                    those who enslaved you, if you do not exteriorize your interiorized servitude
                    and desire to dominate, if you are not literate, if you do not learn how to read
                    (because, to be a member of the community, a man must come to the Torah and must
                    be able to read that part of the Haftorah or he is not a member of the community
                    fully), if you do not follow the law, if you do not break with the past, if you
                    do not remember fully that you were slaves in Egypt, and therefore open your
                    hearts to those who were slaves and are slaves, you will not enter the land
                    flowing with milk and honey. You will wander in the desert.</p>
                <p>Now Haiti has turned into a desert as the Haitian people have wandered. Its
                    leaders were not of the caliber of Moses. They didn't respect the law. They
                    didn't become literate. They didn't cut that terrible link with the master. The
                    leaders continuenot only the leaders, it goes all the way down to the Vodou
                    priest who, to cure an ill for a woman, forces her to have intercoursit goes all
                    the way down. If you don't stop imitating the master, you will never be free.
                    What was the title of that book, now? By the French Jewish philosopher, Emmanuel
                    Levinas. Difficult Liberty.</p>
                <p>Difficult liberty. Eh? I believe that firmly. Everything for me in my life came
                    together in Haiti: my love for this extraordinary woman, my belief in the
                    capacity of people to become better, my admiration of the Haitian peopltheir
                    courage, their intelligence, Ulysses-like intelligence, their Constitutionalism
                    - and my attachment to the fundamental myths of the Jewish tradition, to get a
                    move on and go. There's a bright future, but you've got to move. You've got to
                    move. You can't stay still. And that becomes concrete when it means moving out
                    of slavery towards the land of liberty. That's Haiti for me. I lived that day
                    and night for twenty years, more.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is the end of the second recording of Dan Whitman,
                        Mike Norton. Puerto Rico. The 7th of September 2007.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>This is tape number threDan Whitman interviewing Mike Norton in Puerto Rico. It's
                    the 7th of September. Mike, can we start with some comments of the role of the
                    U.S. government in the U.S. embassy? We're talking about Haiti now. They got,
                    perhaps, some things right, some things wrong. They missed some cues. Were they
                    helpful or harmful by their presence? Tell me your perceptions of that.</p>
                <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                <p>NORTON: I think that the earlier history of the United States' involvement in the
                    Caribbean continued into the last parts of the twentieth century. One doesn't
                    escape history. The past is in front of us. The United States, as I mentioned
                    already, saw Haitian independence at the end of the eighteenth century as a
                    threaa threat to its own slave-holding institution. Haiti was, at the beginning
                    of the nineteenth century, a sort of Cuba of the twentieth century. It had
                    imperial ambitions to free the slaves and conquer territory and wealth. In 1822,
                    President Boyer conquered the eastern two-thirds of the islanwhat is now known
                    as the Dominican Republic. And so on and so forth.</p>
                <p>The Haitian government, in order to obtain recognition from France and access to
                    certain ports of trade, agreed to pay indemnities to the slaveholders and
                    plantation owners who had lost their properties during the revolutionary war,
                    and that cost the Haitian treasury a great deal up until the twentieth century.
                    We don't know exactly when the last tax on coffee was paid to the French. The
                    international community was hostile to this black community. I don't think we
                    realize at this time the crudeness of racism in the nineteenth century. These
                    were people who had defeated the colonial army of France, and they were nothing
                    but savages from Africa. Actually, they weren't savages from Africa. They were
                    savages from the Caribbean, and that attitude of savages in our backyard
                    continued. The United States did not recognize Haiti's independence until, I
                    believe, after the Civil War with Frederick Douglass, the first ambassador. But
                    the hostility, the wariness, continued on. And arrogance.</p>
                <p>Haiti was unable to enter the modern world because of its own militarized
                    society, because of its own incapacity, the incapacity of its leaders to seize
                    the main chance and become a nation like other nations. This due, obviously, to
                    the terrible traumatism of slavery and its isolation. The United States saw the
                    opportunity to put order into Haiti as it did in other countriethe Caribbean and
                    Central Americin the first quarter of the twentieth century. And in 1915, the
                    Marines landed and seized hold of Haiti for nineteen years.</p>
                <p>The assessment of the United States' heritage in Haiti is double. It's ambiguous.
                    On the one hand, they built government buildings that, to this day, house the
                    government offices in downtown Port-au-Prince. They built the National
                    Palaclarge scale, to say the least. And other buildings. They began to build
                    modernized roads. Of course, the revolt against American occupation cost the
                    Haitians thousands of lives. There were forced road gangs. They helped build
                    those roads. A sort of forced modernization developed. Forced modernization.
                    We've seen similar things in Russia and in China, haven't we? In a certain
                    sense, even in the United States. After all, what is slave labor? And the labor
                    of the Chinese in laying the Trans-Continental Railroad. Signs of the times.</p>
                <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                <p>In any case, the modernization was also an opportunity for a new Haitian ruling
                    class to develop a new nationalism in face of this neighbor that treated it with
                    arrogance. And it left behind, the United States did, a watchdog. It's called
                    the Haitian Army. The Haitian Army that was trained on the principles of the
                    Marine Corps. The United States also, since the U.S. occupying forces were to a
                    large extent from the south and this was the south of apartheid, privileged the
                    lighter skinned Haitian bureaucrats and instilled or reinforced the black versus
                    mulatto racism that would explode virulently after other troubles. Fran�ois
                    “Papa Doc” Duvalier took power in 1957.</p>
                <p>It's a long history that the United States accepted Fran�ois “Papa Doc” Duvalier
                    because there was Castro. They made peace with this man, with this dictator,
                    because they didn't want to make peace with the other dictator. To each his own
                    son of a bitch. And the United States' choice of sons of a bitches was “Papa
                    Doc” Duvalier, and he held the fort. I believe that Haiti cast the deciding vote
                    in the expulsion of Cuba from the organization of American States.</p>
                <p>The United States accepted Fran�ois “Papa Doc” Duvalier because there was Castro.
                    Again, the thread through all of this is a certain selectiveness in what
                    constitutes a credible informant. It doesn't necessarily have to be the mulattos
                    as it was in the 1920's and '30's and let the devil take the hindmost. But a
                    certain selectiveness in what constitutes a credible informant. Obviously, the
                    credible informants for Washington were those that owed the most to Washington.
                    That's one thing.</p>
                <p>A pugnaciousness and impatience in relations. That continued. And a certain
                    tendency toward exclusion. The best thing that could happen to Haiti with
                    respect to the United States is that it disappear. It disappear. The boat people
                    problem, of course, is another problem related to everything I have been saying.
                    The economy of Haiti floundered and was less and less able to keep the Haitian
                    people fed.</p>
                <p>Many Haitians did become American residents and citizens, and this somewhat
                    moderated, gave a somewhat narrower margin of maneuver, I believe, to American
                    arrogance toward Haiti. I think the development of the Black Caucus in the U.S.
                    Congress also put a limit on what you might call the natural tendency of
                    American foreign policy to treat Haiti as though it were a bug that has appeared
                    after a rock has been thoughtlessly removed. So, the problem, basically, for
                    American foreign policy is, how to put the rock back on top of the bug. I think
                    that just about sums it up. There's a bug, and there's a rock, and how do we get
                    the rock back onto the bug. It's a mindset.</p>
                <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                <p>My idea is that there is no threat. Haiti will not threaten stability in the
                    United States' south. Slavery no longer exists, I think. In fact, perhaps not in
                    mind, the Black Caucus doesn't need Haiti to defend its people. There's no
                    threat there. There's no internal threat. Haiti does not threaten the United
                    States. The boat people. Well, when Clinton misled the Haitian people and more
                    or less said, “Come to the United States,” and tens of thousands of them did.
                    That was a mistake of Clinton, and that was easily righted, corrected. There are
                    a couple thousand boat people. They keep on going. They have been going, leaving
                    Haiti, since the beginning of the twentieth century, at first to Cuba and to the
                    United States later on. It's normal, and it's easily contained. The bug can be
                    put back under the rock with no problem since the U.S. Coast Guard is patrolling
                    with great efficiency the waters.</p>
                <p>And then those who aren't picked up drown at sea. We don't know exactly how many
                    do make it to Florida, but I don't believe it will be necessary to seed the
                    Florida waters with sharks. The immigration authorities have their walls to
                    build in the southwest. They don't have to seed the waters of Florida with
                    sharks to prevent the Haitians from coming. Those who do come legally, and about
                    eighteen thousand do comfamily memberper year, quite a considerable population
                    come to the United States legally because of family arrangements. It's a growing
                    community.</p>
                <p>I think that once the Haitian population gets its act together, as I already
                    mentioned, some things could happen. Maybe the United States foreign policy will
                    treat Haiti with more respect. I say more respect because, as I already
                    mentioned, I believe as soon as I reached Haiti in 1986 and saw that the
                    categories my American friends were using to understand Haiti were completely
                    irrelevant. When I saw the enormous hope that Haitians hahope based upon
                    trading, free enterprise, small businessmeHaitians are in the Haitian mode very
                    individualistic. They don't like the state. They fled the state because the
                    state, in their mind, is repressive. And, in fact, is repressive. They don't
                    want to have anything to do with collectivization or any of that stuff. There
                    was no way to understand Haiti in that sense. There was no way to understand
                    Haiti, either, as a conflict, as a class struggle, since the bourgeoisie was
                    basically import/export, mercantile. It was not a productive bourgeoisie. The
                    bourgeoisie had a lot of money, but there weren't that many of thea couple
                    hundred families. A couple hundred millionaires in a country of eight million.
                    The biggest fortune in Haiti is about $40 million, not much in the modern world.
                    In the U.S., the top one per cent owns as much as the bottom 90 per cent.</p>
                <p>Basically, the peasantry was in disaggregation. You don't have class struggle
                    between classes that are being declassed. So that's the end of that. The
                    peasantry is not going to descend upon the capital and set up a Peasant People's
                    Republic. You have to think about Haiti in different terms. And, well, if
                    Haitians didn't have the terms, I guess you can't fault Americans for not
                    thinking Haiti through. Too bad, but I don't think the United States had the
                    credible informants to tell them what, to me, was so obvious.</p>
                <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                <p>Altruism, acting outside of the view that boxes you into your world. Think Haiti
                    in terms of Haiti's needs and not in terms of the United States' geopolitical
                    needs. In the short term and in the long run, the United States will benefit
                    from the security of the Caribbean. Communist Cuba, have faith in your own
                    system, will not last forever. That's obvious. Not because of the social
                    benefits. People will not cease being communist in Cuba because they no longer
                    are educated and have health care, but because of the one party system, because
                    it's a police state and people don't like that. People have this tendency to
                    express themselves, to communicate, and this is a world in which people can talk
                    instantly to their neighbors on the opposite side of the world. The Cuban police
                    state will collapse in due time, so take it easy, man. Take it easy, man. Pay
                    attention to the case in point.</p>
                <p>It would have been possible in 1986 and became more and more possible as time
                    went on because Haiti did kind of launch itself into view. It had been under
                    control by the Duvaliers for a long time as part of one of the bulwarks in the
                    Cold War, and then suddenly the Haitian people, as I already said, popped out of
                    Pandora's box and claimed what? Well, what somebody in Minnesota would clamor
                    for. What somebody in Cleveland, Ohio, somebody in Topeka, Poughkeepsie, Tampa,
                    Portland, Lord knows where, Santa Monica, Hollywood, too. Give us a chance. We
                    want to work. We want to make a life for ourselves and our children. We don't
                    want a repressive government. We want people who will represent us and who will
                    be answerable to us for their deeds. Help us to develop our country. We've got a
                    special problem here. We've got a problem of a country turning into a desert. An
                    enormous peasant population that doesn't have the means to convert land into a
                    productive instrument. We have many communities outside main population centers,
                    and they're dying.</p>
                <p>There are projects which may not require such a heavy outlay which may not bring
                    so much profit to construction companies who come down from Canada, the United
                    States, from who knows where, France built roads, to build asphalt roads. Just
                    to give you an example, asphalt roads last about three years and take about
                    twenty years to pay for. I'm not an accountant. That doesn't seem to make much
                    sense to me. To build asphalt roads in a tropical climate. It's been going on
                    for years. Corruption. Haiti is said to be one of the most corrupt countries in
                    the world. I don't quite get that. Sure, government officials are corrupt, but
                    there isn't that much money to steal. It's a small, poor country. The Haitian
                    bourgeoisie, which in the press is generally characterized as monstrously
                    indifferent to the country, as flowing with milk and honey, has reached the
                    Promised Land behind its barricades in its fortresses in the lush, upscale
                    suburb of P�tionville—that is nonsense. The Haitian bourgeoisie is poor, poor,
                    poor because wealth is not money in the bank.</p>
                <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                <p>There's no place to go where you can feel safe in Haiti. There's no river that
                    you can walk along holding hands with your girlfriend. There are no outdoor
                    cafes. I was in Paris. I was “dirt poor.” Sometimes Toto and I, we spent a
                    couple days eating popcorn. We were the wealthiest couple on earth. Not just
                    because of our own particular happiness, you know? We lived in Paris, on Paris,
                    because you had access to galleries. You had access to lovely parks. You could
                    do a hundred things and not spend a cent. You bought a card and you took a bus
                    and bused it all month.</p>
                <p>What can you do in Haiti? You can live in your fancy house, and then, on the
                    weekends, drive on these horrible roads. A number of my friends, rich and poor,
                    died on those roads because of car accidentterrible, terrible car accidents. You
                    go to your seaside house and you jump into the water. And then what? You come
                    back and...poor, poor, poor. The university is poor, poor, poor. The schoolthere
                    are a couple of good schools that cost a lot of monebut how do you get your kid
                    to school? You need a convoy, Humvees, to get your kid to school safe?</p>
                <p>And then there's the odor, the stench. What about smelling the fresh air in
                    spring? Minnesota's spring has made me the wealthiest person on earth. For all
                    my life, I just close my eyes and remember the smell of spring. That's wealth.
                    You're poor in Haiti. Everybody is poor, poor, poor in Haiti. P�tionville, which
                    is a suburb, a hillside suburb outside of the capital, appears to the unpeeled
                    eye to be relatively wealthy. There are stores, there are restaurants. Some
                    houses are visible.</p>
                <p>Of course, I remember when Aristide was running for president in 1991 and he came
                    to P�tionville, and the poor people of P�tionville came out to greet him. They
                    came out of these ravines. You see, there are no residential sections in Haiti.
                    It's not like other Latin-American countries. There's no privileged section. You
                    have a beautiful, big house and it's sitting in a slum. And the people who work
                    in your house are slum dwellers, so you are in osmosis even behind your thick
                    walls. Tens of thousands, the majority of the people in upscale P�tionville, are
                    poor and live in shanties. You just don't see them, and you don't see them
                    because you don't look. And there's nobody there, and I'm talking about the
                    foreign visitors, to tell you. Well, that's not quite true. There are a lot of
                    people doing good deeds. A lot of NGO's, a lot of missionaries, but that doesn't
                    really affect American foreign policy. Poverty in Haiti is not rife. Poverty in
                    Haiti is universal.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You stated earlier what you thought was the aspiration of
                        the typical Haitian similar to the person in Santa Monica, Topeka,
                        Poughkeepsie, to give them a chance, allow them to function, assure that the
                        government is not oppressing their wishes. This is pretty close to the
                        stated policy of the U.S. government for Haiti. Where is the discrepancy
                        between word and deed?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0067" n="Page0067"/>
                <p>NORTON: The discrepancy is the urgency of the moment. You have to formulate
                    policy and you formulate policy not with reference to principle but with
                    reference to interest. What has happened to the American Constitution? Today in
                    the United States, internal insecuritinsecurity that comes from real
                    threatexaggerated, manipulated; but structural insecurity in the United States
                    is fundamentally job insecurity, unemployment, the threat of losing your job in
                    a fast-changing world, of not being able to keep up and of not being able to
                    send your kids to college and of not being able to make your payments on the
                    house and of not having health insurance. And, if you don't do what you're
                    supposed to do, the punishment is severe. You lose your house and you lose a
                    roof. You get sick and you die and suffer. You can't send your kids to college,
                    you've got your kids' ignorance on your hands.</p>
                <p>Okay, that is the fact, and yet life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness and
                    all of those principles,..there are reasons why the insecurity in the United
                    States is increasing. It doesn't have anything to do with the Constitution. It
                    has to do with policy which in the United States is based upon corporate
                    interest. Corporate interest is not really 100% equivalent to checks and
                    balances, is it? It's something else. It's called the economy. And the kings of
                    the economy are not the subjects of a democracy. The United States is a
                    plutocracy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you're talking about principles of the U.S.
                        Constitution that do not filter through to the daily lives on the micro
                        level?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORTON: No, they can't because something else is at stake. There is an Overt
                    State, law-respecting if not law-abiding, there is a Covert State whose agents
                    act outside the law. The State is schizoid. The tension in the democratic empire
                    between the Republic and the Empire is not creative, it is a fatal flaw.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: If that's the way you see it, translate, if you would,
                        that concept to the level of the U.S. government and Haiti.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORTON; The problem for the U.S. in Haiti and elsewhere is how to act outside of
                    your borders. You don't have to deal with the rest of the world on an equal
                    footing. The Constitution is disabled. There is a U.N. Charter now for human
                    rights. People pay lip service to it, but there are other considerations. The
                    consideration for Haiti is geopolitical stability, and the only way that
                    unimaginative Americans, fed/nourished by a century of 150 years or so of
                    arrogance and ignorance and racism and what have you, is to put the rock back on
                    the bug.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there for eighteen years. Looking back at it, do
                        you feel that this was a consistent explanation that reveals what the U.S.
                        government was doing during those eighteen years? Were there ups and downs?
                        Were there individual cases of moments of perception or moments of
                        ignorance? Can you break this down into the details?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORTON: Let me explain this to you. I'm not talking to you about individuals. I
                    may have mentioned it to you already. I found several of the ambassadors with
                    whom I had contact to be extremely intelligent people. I think they understood
                    or could have understood. They may have disagreed with me. I know that at the
                    end when the problem of negotiating a settlement with Aristide and the rest of
                    civil society became the object of American foreign policy, and an article of
                    faith. Keep the rock on the bug meant get people to agree and at least have a
                    fa�ade of democracy.</p>
                <p>I think that the diplomats, many of them, believed that it was possible. I never
                    did. And so there were differences of opinion, but those differences were honest
                    differences of evaluation. So I don't want to talk about individuals... There
                    were some pretty stupid ones. I think I mentioned the case of the DCM who was on
                    a bombing mission to North Vietnam. Some of them. There were hundreds of people
                    working with the U.S. embassy, and I think you wouldn't even have to say that
                    seven thousand missionaries were satellites of the embassy, too. Of course, many
                    of them were selfless and many of them were not. I'm talking about the
                    missionaries. Many were out to save their souls, the souls of the heathen,
                    without having the slightest idea of what the soul was of Haitians. Many of them
                    wanted to do good deeds but not leave the means to do good deeds in the hands of
                    the Haitians. But that's not the point. The point is this, I'll give you in an
                    anecdote.</p>
                <p>Two State Department officials come to Haiti. Were they on the Haiti desk? I
                    don't know where they were, but they were important enough to link up with me.
                    Two of them. And they came and they sat down. I forget exactly when it was, but
                    late on, though not all the way to the end when it really became apparent that
                    no agreement was possible and that the only way to get on with the show would be
                    to get rid of Aristide. The general questions, and I gave my usual spiel. And
                    Aristide came up. I gave my character profile of the man which was incidentally,
                    and we can come back to this subject, absolutely in contradiction to the New
                    York Times profile of Aristide that was written when he came back to powea puff
                    piece if I've ever seen one. Obviously ordered up because the reporter was a
                    good reporter, but he was ignorant and he was told, I suppose, to present
                    Aristide as someone who had learned his lesson, who would keep his mouth shut,
                    who wouldn't insult the Pope, he wouldn't call on people to scalp the
                    bourgeoisie or do other horrible things. He was a changed man.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: 1995?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0069" n="Page0069"/>
                <p>NORTON; I think it was. In any case, he was back in power. Hope against hope, the
                    hope you see...The United States government was so hopeful about Aristide, at
                    least the State Department was, I don't think the Company was. But both, I
                    believe, thought Haiti was a nothing country. It was getting more publicity than
                    it was worth.</p>
                <p>But Haiti, for a journalist, was not a nothing country. I worked for The AP, The
                    Associated Press, from 1988 or the fall of Manigat to the second ouster of
                    Aristide. That's sixteen years. I must have written at least three thousand
                    articles. That's not counting my colleagues, the news editors who came down to
                    take a look at my...to taste my soup.</p>
                <p>It's a colorful country. It's a wonderful country. There's Vodou, the people's
                    smile, it's a photographer's paradise. You go down to Haiti, you can't stop
                    taking pictures. Everything is colorful, strong, stark, violent, beautiful.
                    Taste the life. It smells bad, but jeez. That's life. You know it's life. It's
                    raw. It's wild. It's oof. Strong. It's strong. You know, you come from some kind
                    of prefabricated, bleached suburb. Everything is well organized. You come down.
                    You think it's anarchy, of course. You don't see the order. I mean, that's
                    another one of the clich�its “disorder.” It doesn't have an infrastructure
                    that's functioning but the order that people impose is extraordinary. The order
                    that people impose in great slums like Cite Soleil is extraordinary. Giving the
                    lie to all these smug people who see people living in infrahuman conditionit's
                    superhuman conditions they're living in. How people can make a livable
                    enterprise out of living on a land fill at sea level with no plumbing and no
                    potable water and no nothing and yet it's just bursting with life. It's just
                    bubbling.</p>
                <p>And, I tell you, if I had to choose between dying in an old folks' home or gated
                    community in Florida and a tin hut in Cite Soleil, I'd die in Cite Soleil
                    because I would hear children's voices. I would hear music. And I get used to
                    the bad smells. And I'd die probably a little earlier than in the old folks'
                    home, but maybe I would have had a taste of reality. Happiness.</p>
                <p>So the two State Department men came down and they asked what I thought, and I
                    gave my spiel and I gave my profile of Aristidthat Aristide was impossible, that
                    he would never agree to anything and that his rivals for power were impossible
                    and would never agree to anything. That's the way it is in Haiti, and I gave the
                    reasons why and blah blah blah. And they said to me, “Mike, you really expect us
                    to go back and to tell our bosses what you just told us?” What I had to say, and
                    the future proved me right, was something that could not be heard. It could not
                    be heard. It could not be heard because there was a policy. Because, as the DCM
                    said, they had a mission.</p>
                <pb facs="0070" n="Page0070"/>
                <p>I'll tell you another anecdote just to smooth any ruffled feelings on the part of
                    the American diplomats. I tried to understand them. In one of our many meetings,
                    Ambassador Alvin Adams and I discussed the possibilities. This was early on in
                    the coup d'�tat. What can be done to find some compromise? Aristide is in exile
                    in Washington learning how much money he can make making deals with the Black
                    Caucus, preparing his return after shitting in his pants when he was ousted. I
                    said that is very important because if you shit in your pants in front of a
                    general who took the head of the coup d'�tat against you, you're full of hate
                    and you lose it. Hate is a theme in Haiti which is very important. Bear with me.
                    I'll come back to Alvin Adams.</p>
                <p>Hate. I was just reading in a book this morning by A. C. Grayling. Grayling is a
                    British philosophefrom his Meditations of the Humanist. It's a little chapter on
                    hate, and he quotes Ortega y Gasset, the Spanish philosopher. “Hatred is a
                    sentiment that leads to the extinction of values.”</p>
                <p>Aristide was full of hate, as many Haitians are, because of the gross injustice.
                    Gross social injustice. (May I add that I lost my innocence in Haiti about the
                    purity of the motives of people who clamor for justice?) And it has made many
                    nihilistmany of them into nihilists. From the very beginning, the extraordinary
                    pain of having been a slave. When finally they felt a little power, many
                    Haitians were nihilists, the idea being, “The only way you can make a new world
                    is by destroying the old world.” It's similar to, but in fact opposite to, the
                    exodus of the Hebrews from Egypt, where the injunction was to separate yourself
                    from the master, not to kill the master because you become those you kill. It
                    wasn't a hate. It was to turn your minds elsewhere. Never to forget you were a
                    slave, which is not the same thing as to hate for all eternity the master who
                    made you a slave. Dessalines, his war cry was koupe tet, boule kay, “Cut off
                    their heads and burn down their houses.” That's how Haitian independence began.
                    It was a common thread through all of Haitian history as though the only way you
                    can start afresh is by destroying everything around you. It's curious. They seem
                    not to learn the lesson because everything around them is destroyed.</p>
                <p>Okay, now what do you do that you've destroyed everything. Aristide was a
                    hatred-filled person, full of hate, and all you have to do is listen to his
                    speeches. He lost it. He lost it many times. He expressed his hatred, of course,
                    sometimes in coded words, sometimes directly in his Creole speeches, lashing out
                    at the bourgeoisie, at the mulattos, at the Pope, at the Westerners, etc.</p>
                <p>Anyways, so there we were, Alvin Adams and I, discussing what the United States
                    can do with Aristide. He's in exile. There are various Constitutional provisions
                    which are too complicated to go into here, but one of them provides for
                    provisional power while the president is out of commission. He's still
                    president, but he's not governing. And there's another provision which, under
                    other circumstances, entails electing a provisional president. And the
                    legislature has to decide.</p>
                <pb facs="0071" n="Page0071"/>
                <p>The United States preferred, quite rightly, that provision which enabled Aristide
                    to be president of Haiti but without officiating. That's what we were
                    discussing. Will the legislature do it? What do you think about this?</p>
                <p>And, of course, I said, “I don't believe that that wise step will be the step
                    that the legislature will take, and I'll tell you why.”</p>
                <p>So I went into the composition of the legislature, the influence of the military,
                    the fear that was all through society, etc., and I was right. Finally, when push
                    came to shove, everybody, even those who opposed the coup d'�tat, voted a
                    provisional president.</p>
                <p>Anyways, I said, “It's not going to work, Mr. Adams. It's not going to work. You
                    can't do it.” Poor man, I kind of got on his nerves. I was insufferable. I was
                    insufferable on more than one occasion with more than one person. I was really
                    insufferable. I was almost never wrong. That's not my fault. That's an
                    insufferable thing to say, isn't it? I was wrong when I didn't think that the
                    United States would invade Haiti. I was wrong because I was ignorant. I didn't
                    understand the importance of the Black Caucuthe deals that Aristide had struck
                    with them. But that's outside of Haiti. In Haiti I was never wrong, so I was
                    insufferablsometimes deliberately, sometimes unconsciously. Should I beg pardon?
                    I was insufferable.</p>
                <p>Anyways, Alvin blew up, and he said, “God damn it, Mike! You have the luxury of
                    sitting there picking holes in everything I'm proposing. I have to do something.
                    You don't have to do anything.” Well, there you go. That's true. The United
                    States has to do something. The State Department has to formulate a policy. Now
                    that policy isn't in function only of Haiti and the welfare of Haitians. That's
                    the way it is. There's no way around it. Now, if the Haitians knew how to
                    influence that foreign policy theater, because their community in the United
                    States was better organized, or if there was more unity in Haiti and more
                    thoughtfulness about the question, perhaps that foreign policy would be more
                    amenable to the welfare of Haiti.</p>
                <p>Perhaps that altruism I talked about would be possible. Short term, not long
                    term. Not unrealistic, pie in the sky, sentimental, bleeding heart altruism. A
                    different way of looking at Haiti, endogenous, a development for Haiti. But if
                    the Haitians aren't offering any solutions, if the Haitians aren't giving any
                    projects, if the Haitians don't have their act together, the United States will
                    go on its bumbling way. Bumbling, rambunctious way. Until you have what you have
                    now, a U.N. security exoskeleton and foreign aid coming in as it will to do the
                    same sort of old projects, and nothing good will come of it.</p>
                <pb facs="0072" n="Page0072"/>
                <p>And if the Haitians today, in September, have a breathing spell that there's a
                    little bit less insecurity, well it won't last. First of all, insecurity in
                    Haiti is somewhat more than just being shot at or being kidnapped and raped.
                    It's...a friend of mine, a very good friend of mine from the countryside, who
                    was a welder and later became an artist, we were talking about poverty. And I
                    said, “Poverty.” I'm very sententious as well as being insufferable. “Poverty is
                    not knowing what you're going to eat tomorrow.” And he said, “Poverty is knowing
                    you will not eat tomorrow.”</p>
                <p>Put that in your pipe and smoke it please when you think about insecurity in
                    Haiti and that people in Haiti have a breathing spell. They will not eat
                    tomorrow. Everybody moves because, if they don't move, they'll die because they
                    have to scuffle in order to eat because they know that tomorrow they won't eat.
                    They don't have the means and they don't have the services.</p>
                <p>When there was a strike in the hospital - it's one of the low points in my career
                    in Haiti was covering the hospital strike: the pitiful salaries, the janitors
                    refused to pick uI went down there and I found dead babies under the stairways.
                    I found a dead baby in front of the residents' dormitory. Dead baby in the
                    hospital, think of that. Job insecurity? There's job security in Haiti. You know
                    you're not going to work. You know absolutely. You're sure of it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You've talked about Alvin Adams and you've avoided
                        singling out individuals. Is it correct to say that there may have been ups
                        and downs in talent and options made in Port-au-Prince, but that the options
                        made in Port-au-Prince at the U.S. embassy were quite limited because
                        everything was being driven by Washington? Is that your perception?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORTON: My perception was that the policy was a sort of a feeling of fate. It
                    doesn't matter whether you understood or not. In a certain sense, the DCM was
                    right. It doesn't matter if you understand. There's a bug and there's a rock on
                    it, or there's a bug and there's not a rock on it, so you've got to put the rock
                    back on the bug. I mean what's there to understand? What's there to
                    understand?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Some people say that the perceptions of the U.S. embassy
                        in Port-au-Prince were very different from the perceptions of the policy
                        makers in Washington.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0073" n="Page0073"/>
                <p>NORTON: Well, I suppose. As I said, in 1986 when the shit hit the fan, nobody was
                    prepared. It was a stick in the eye of the Cold War. It was unsteady, we decided
                    to get rid of Duvalier. But we got it in hand that the military would step in. I
                    don't think people were prepared, and I know that among the diplomats in the
                    embassy as well as among the journalists that came down, a slow increasing
                    sensitivity to Haitian realities. Completely insensitive for the first years.
                    The military, in fact, supported by the United States, did terrible things to
                    Haiti. It became more complicated when the military really lost its hold on
                    things and the United States decided well, yes, we better have an elected
                    government without the interference of the military. People went out into the
                    countryside. I think a lot of people got over the shock of the distinction
                    between Haiti and the United States. It's quite a culture shock for Americans.
                    As I already mentioned, it doesn't matter what ethnic group you belong to in the
                    United States. When you step outside of the United States, you're an
                    American.</p>
                <p>Haiti is living in the rough. It's what is known as a “hardship post.” It's not
                    so far away as Sudan or something like that, but what makes it even worse is
                    it's an hour and a half away. An hour and a half away from Miami and you're on
                    another planet? You don't have to spend a couple million dollars to go into
                    orbital flight. It's really some place else. It's very, very hard to understand.
                    You have to spend a lot of time and I think a lot of the officers in the
                    American embassy did. A lot of them were condescending. A lot of them were not.
                    Maybe the minority were not, but they were there. People got to know Haiti when
                    they were in USAID. You're out in the fields; you learn. In the international
                    financial agencies, the IADB for example, whatever the result was before the
                    repetition of the past there was a lot of discussion.</p>
                <p>I discussed very often with these people, and I was very often delighted. We were
                    on the same wave length. I was not, by any means, a loner in Haiti. Not by any
                    means. The problem wasn't finally understanding. Once you decide you don't know
                    anything, just open your eyes and shut up. Listen. Move around. Compare. Try to
                    build your understanding from the ground up. It's not so hard to understand. Be
                    prepared. Haiti is some place where you see a god walking in the street because
                    they're possessed by a Vodou god. Haiti is some place where atheism, the great
                    topic of the New York Review of Books these days, is inconceivable. It's
                    inconceivable because people see God all the time. They touch him. They are even
                    penetrated by him. And it's very confusing. It's very infectious.</p>
                <p>I had a friend, a woman, who convinced me, rationalist of rationalists, that she
                    was impregnated by a god, that her pregnancy was the result of one. She
                    convinced me. There you go. Magic works when you're in it. People are terrified
                    of black magic because the spells work in Haiti. A lot of people coming down to
                    Haiti will say, “Ah, you talk about Aristide as though he were the devil. Stop
                    demonizing Aristide.” And my answer to them was this. “You don't believe in the
                    devil, but Haitians do. And they know how to identify him.”</p>
                <pb facs="0074" n="Page0074"/>
                <p>So, there's no clash of civilizations. There is an incomprehension which is, at
                    times, total. Okay, you go down, you bathe in that, you immerse yourself in
                    that. You try to maintain your own integrity. You are not...you are who you are.
                    If you're lucky, you even, as I did, sharpen your own values. It's a wonderful
                    opportunity to find out who you are by finding out who you are not, and in
                    mutual respect. And then you have some ideas how this can be improved. And then
                    you talk to the powers that be. But you're talking to the wall. That's the
                    problem. There's no way to translate that understanding into a policy that's
                    other than the policy that a great power might have toward a little particle of
                    dust. There's no way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're saying that on some occasions, diplomats and others

                <p>NORTON; As I mentioned, because their eye wasn't on the ball. You invite them to
                    play handball and they're playing checkers. It's another game. It has to do
                    with, I don't know, getting Brown and Root down there to supply the troops who
                    had landed in 1994, satisfying the Black Caucus, finding ways of making deals in
                    the new Haiti, getting contracts, telephone contracts, dealing with the
                    well-heeled Haitian lobby in the United States, reconciling the irreconcilable,
                    pro-Aristide and anti-Aristide. It's listening to the Dominican Republic. It's
                    doing a lot of things. Trying to figure out how you can make some money out of
                    it. You know? What kind of contract can be given to which construction firms?
                    All kinds of things feed into American policy. You give Aristide a chance, Okay.
                    See what you can do, and it doesn't work out. And you plop down and boot him
                    out.</p>
                <p>Haiti is not Aristide. Aristide said he was Haiti, but Haiti is not Aristide.
                    Haiti didn't recognize itself in Aristide at the end. Haiti is a community, a
                    collective, which wants to live. And, in order to help it live, you need thought
                    and action, responsiveness to Haiti. American foreign policy is primarily
                    responsiveness to its own needs. It's an election year. Can we risk an invasion?
                    It's important.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned at the end, I think you're talking about

                <p>NORTON: Yah. Why was the international left so easily duped by Aristide? The
                    Haitian political revolution was the last revolution of the twentieth century in
                    which the left believed it could believe. The last illusion of a belief addict,
                    desperate for a fix. Aristide said what they wanted to hear: anti-imperialism,
                    anti-capitalism, anti-ruling class, anti-Pope John Paul II. Stuff and nonsense.
                    The left gobbled it up. Aristide believed in money, in power, in sex and in his
                    manic grandeur. He was the political heir of Papa Doc.</p>
                <p>Renowned leftists deduced Aristide's good intentions from their principles and
                    from his statements of principle, disregarding the fact that he was
                    unprincipled. The enemy of my enemy is not necessarily my friend.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tell me about the activities and the perceptions of the
                        Black Caucus at the time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORTON: The Black Caucus was obviously the key to Aristide's return. Why did they
                    decide to push for his return? I think there are a number of reasons. I think,
                    personally, they were right in 1994. Aristide was the duly elected president,
                    however bad he was, however horrible he was, whatever his motivations were. To
                    be consistent, Aristide was elected and his term was important to respect. The
                    army was stupid, criminal, and flaky. So, to return Aristide I believe was
                    absolutely essential. Why the Black Caucus did that, I believe maybe some for
                    principle, others because they saw the coup d'�tat as a result of American
                    foreign policy or, put it this way, that the CIA dumped Aristide. And it was
                    also a way of their expressing their own racism.</p>
                <p>Maxine Waters told me once that she believed American policy was racist, and was
                    an apartheid foreign policy. The American foreign policy was racist. Others
                    because they were on the pay roll. They were on the public relations payroll.
                    Aristide paid lots of money, millions and millions of dollars, to American
                    lobbyists. I think that's the reason. Black solidarity. Hatred of American
                    foreign policy, characterizing it as racist. Financial arrangements. And
                    principle. And so they got him back. Now, the problem later was why they didn't
                    recognize how bad he was. That, in fact, if they had brought him back on
                    principle, they were to regret it. I'm talking now about the second term.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Elected in the year 2000.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0076" n="Page0076"/>
                <p>NORTON: Right. “Elected.” And, I think inertia, financial arrangements, I think
                    some were on the payroll, and inertia and financial arrangements. They kept on.
                    And, you know, a lot of people had their irons in Aristide's fire. Danny Glover
                    was in there in the palace a couple of days before the ouster. I remember
                    talking to him and he finally found some financing for his Toussaint Louverture
                    film project in Venezuela. Toussaint Louverture, one of the founding fathers of
                    Haitian independence. It was in his interest to get along with Aristide. I don't
                    think he saw Aristide as a dictator or didn't see anything wrong with what he
                    was doing. I don't know. Paul Farmer, the Harvard doctor who treats AIDS in the
                    central plateau. It was in his interest. People like that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you explain, in the interest of Paul Farmer...what's
                        that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORTON: Well, I mean, he had the advantages, granted, that he was protected by
                    the government, and the government could propose to the international financial
                    institutions financing that would be finally directed to his institution.</p>
                <p>Now, I suppose Farmer has his reasons for believing that Aristide was a
                    progressive leader. He may have had his reasons. He may be sincere. But it is
                    also the case that it was in his interest that Aristide stay on. And a lot of
                    the people liked him, at first. Later on was another story. His so-called
                    popular organizationthousands, three, four thousand, not much more than thain
                    the capital city. It was in their interest that Aristide stay on because, thanks
                    to him, they got jobs in the public enterprisethe featherbedding and all the
                    kind of stuff. That doesn't make for a hell of a lot of people, does it? Three,
                    four, five, six thousand. You know? It's not a hell of a lot of support.</p>
                <p>The Haitian people were like the American people who voted for Bush in 2000. They
                    wouldn't vote for Bush now. They certainly voted for him theless than half of
                    the American popular vote. Slightly less than half of the American electorate
                    voted for Bush. Now does that mean that half the American people are stupid?
                    Misguided, wrong, like the Haitian people, who voted in a landslide for Aristide
                    certainly the first time. The second time, I'm not so sure with a strong
                    opponent he would have won. But by the end, he had his thousands of thug
                    government employees, intellectuals who had something to gain by his staying in
                    power, Black Caucus, and fanatic Haitians abroad who didn't know anything about
                    Haiti who just were very distraught about what their homeland was coming to and
                    had hung on to Aristide.</p>
                <p>Aristide's popularity abroad diminished, but it was enormous, I know, because
                    during the coup d'�tat I gave weekly commentaries to the Haitian community in
                    Montreal. They were rabid. They couldn't stand me. It was really funny. Once I
                    even went to Montreal and had an open line. That was funny. One woman said, “I
                    don't know why the presenter of this program says you're a great journalist. If
                    you are in Haiti, you're not great.”</p>
                <pb facs="0077" n="Page0077"/>
                <p>Anything in Haiti is not great except Aristide, so that started to wear off, and
                    I must admit, at least in Montreal to a certain extent, I persuaded people that
                    there was something wrong about this guy. That he had made terrible mistakes in
                    1991. He didn't deserve being ousted, that is to say the Haitian people didn't
                    deserve having their elected president ousted, but if he comes back and when he
                    comes back, there are certain things that ought to change. Then later when they
                    didn't, then the handwriting was on the wall because I said way back I don't
                    know how many hours ago, it is impossible to patch together a dictatorship. You
                    cannot build bricks without straw. There's something missing in Haiti. You
                    can't, you know? You can't build a skyscraper out of sand and spit. The Haitian
                    state has disintegrated. Haiti is a failed state. Haiti was a failed state a
                    long time ago. Haiti was a failed state since Aristide demobilized the army in
                    the year 1994.</p>
                <p>Now that concept, the definition of which I found in a U.N. brochure, I don't
                    know which one, I would read to my diplomat friends because I would say,
                    “Haiti's a failed state.” And they all said, “No, Haiti's not a failed state.”
                    “But look. This is what the UN says. There is no institution which covers the
                    entire territory. No institution. No national institution. Not national
                    education, not health, not the army, not the police, nothing. There is no order,
                    the loosening of authority. It's a failed state.” “No.”</p>
                <p>See, the resistance...Haiti can't be a failed state because, if it is a failed
                    state, we must take certain measures. We are not prepared to take those
                    measures. Therefore, Haiti was not a failed state. Haiti is now a failed state.
                    Now everybody agrees. So, the result of all of this is that Haiti indefinitely
                    will be under UN protection. Maybe there will be a revolt of Haitians or maybe
                    people will be tired. The donor nations will get tired of footing the bill and
                    then they'll pull out. And then they'll start all over again. They'll start all
                    over again because nothing will stop the free fall except respect for the
                    individual, and there's no reason to respect the individual. And there's no
                    hope.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You said the diaspora in Montreal. There's a diaspora in

                </p>
                <p>NORTON: No, I don't really know the communities separately or all together very
                    well anymore. I'm thinking especially Haitians who get elected to jobs on city
                    councils, who become mayors, but who are Haitians and will have to be answerable
                    to Haitians, and therefore can express Haitians' concerns about their homeland.
                    I think that may take time. It may take too much time.</p>
                <p>Time is running out. Time is running out. The population will double in a
                    generation. It's a catastrophe. It's an ecological catastrophe. Will you have
                    marauding hordes of people crossing from one end of the country on camels? There
                    are no oases in Haiti. It's nothing. On the other hand, there's everything. If
                    there were some tourist facilities. If there were a different kind of tourism.
                    If the Haitian state promoted its own fabulous art. There is no national art
                    museum. Haitian art is known worldwide, but Haitian art is not expensive because
                    Haitian bourgeois don't buy it at Sotheby's or Christie's. That's how you get
                    the value of a painting. It's what is quoted in the international auctions.
                    Dominican painting, which is not the same, not as good as Haitian painting, or
                    wasn't, I don't know what it's like now, is more expensive because it's pegged
                    on international prices, but Haitians don't care for their own art which is
                    fabulous. Unique. Haitian handicrafts are fabulous.</p>
                <p>There are still remarkable tourist sights in Haiti. The citadel built by King
                    Christophe in the early nineteenth century. I saw it for the first time, I was
                    on a bus, and there it was perched above the cloudthis enormous wedge perched on
                    the clouds. It took my breath away. It's more impressive than the pyramids and
                    means more. What was a pyramid? A pyramid housed the mummy of a monarch; it was
                    in praise of authoritarianism. And here you have this remarkable fortress in
                    defense of liberty, and the only way you can get up there is on donkey-back.
                    It's a crying shame. Jacmelovely coastal town in the south. Old houses that have
                    to be rebuilt and renovated. Guest houses could be build. Labadie which is on
                    the north coast which receives cruisers. I thought it would be something tawdry.
                    No, it's not. Beautiful. Absolutely beautiful and respectful of the Haitian
                    scene. For many years when you went to Labadie, you took all these Caribbean
                    cruises, they didn't even say it was in Haiti. They were afraid people would be
                    afraid.</p>
                <p>Okay, tourism is one possibility. Agro-industry is another, but for that you have
                    to take a look at the food basin of Haiti which is in the Artibonite. You have
                    to renovate the rivers and the streams. You have to organize the peasants. You
                    have to set up industries. You can't be slovenly. There's a mango industry in
                    Haiti. Just recently the mangos were forbidden entry because of some sort of
                    bug. I don't know if it was slovenliness or not. But I tell you you have to
                    realize you are in the modern world and there are standards. Now that depends on
                    the Haitians. If the Haitians would say, “This is what we need. This is ours.
                    Small is beautiful.”</p>

                        Jean-Bertrand Aristide and Mike Norton. Can you tell us about the
                        circumstances of your departure?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORTON: The two departures did have something to do with each other, if I may say
                    so. It's not because, having been a fervent supporter of Aristide, I was afraid
                    of staying which those who led the movement to oust Aristide might have thought,
                    although I don't think they thought that about me. I don't think I was of
                    considerable importance. If I wasn't writing anything, they could not care less
                    what I thought. I left because I was ill. I was very ill. I had been ill for
                    more than a year, and I was carrying this tumor under my arm around with me.
                    This tumor was delighted to stay on. It was growing, growing, growing, growing.
                    I was tired. I was worn out. Not burnt out, but worn out. I was completely
                    disgusted with the movement to oust Aristide. I believed in his ouster. I
                    believe it was a necessary good for the country, but when I saw the people and I
                    listened to their demands, I foresaw. It wasn't a prophecy; it follows as a
                    bowel movement does a stomach ache. You don't have to be very intelligent. Just
                    look at the people who are ousting him. The worst elements of reactionary
                    regimes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Guy Philippe?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORTON: Guy Philippe. It was more than Guy Philippe, my God. The ragtag and
                    bobtail army of so-called soldiers had obviously been trained with the
                    complicity of the Dominican Secret Services, and if the Dominican Secret
                    Services knew about it, they were under orders from the Company. It was
                    impossible. You don't train two hundred soldiers or twenty soldiers on Dominican
                    soil without the Dominican Secret Service knowing. And the Dominican Secret
                    Service and the CIA are hand in glove. Come on.</p>
                <p>And, the bourgeoisie, more or less, I'm not quite sure who financed them. So they
                    had the money and they had the permission and then they entered when things
                    really got raw. Aristide had boxed himself in. The OAS had demanded certain
                    things. In order for Aristide to give them what they wanted, he had to attack
                    his own base, his own “popular organizations.” His popular organizations, at
                    least a part of them, turned against him in open revolt. The society wanted no
                    more of him, and I was reporting all of this in this extraordinary upheaval.</p>
                <p>It was Independence Day, celebrating independence from France and Gonaives was up
                    in arms against Aristide. I'll never forget that. The people of Gonaives did not
                    celebrate. Gonaives is where the independence was declared. Aristide, in spite
                    of warnings, decided to go out there. It was a town that was shut down. In its
                    better moments, it was bleaker than the bleakest slum in the United States, but
                    it attained its nadir when Aristide arrived. It was shut down. In order to get
                    some spirit into this affair, he came along with I think it was Maxine Waters
                    and her husband. I think she went up there with him. Mbeki wasn't there. It was
                    too dangerous. It was crazy to go out there.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was in Haiti.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORTON: He was in Haiti, but he didn't go out there. I think he was warned. He
                    was quite right. Get this scene, on the public square these pro-Aristide bands
                    which he had brought with him for the occasion from the capital. No locals
                    appeared. And they were singing songs and scattering pictures of Aristide, etc.
                    Music, rah rah rah Aristide. And on the roofs there were these black-masked
                    policemen taking potshots at anybody they saw in the surrounding that had left
                    his house. Simultaneously. Well, finally it ended and then there was a motorcade
                    and groups/gangs threw stones and it was...the sky did fall on Gonaives that
                    day. Heartbreaking.</p>
                <p>I had already wept all my tears for Haiti, but I would have wept for Haiti on
                    that day if I had had any tears left to weep. This is how you commemorate one of
                    the greatest events in world history? The unloved president praised by glutton
                    minstrels while your pretorian guard is shooting at the local population? I was
                    ill. I was worn out. I saw no good coming. There was no sense. And I saw a
                    window of opportunity, how I could somehow have closure. Lovely word: closure.
                    The end of a book. Fin, you see it on a fish. Fin.</p>
                <p>So I thought it would be poetic if I were to leave. So I knew he was going and I
                    had one week or so before hinted to the American embassy that I needed help to
                    get out. There was no way out. The airports were closed. Everything was... I had
                    hinted to the American embassy that I was really very sick, and I really was.
                    “Hey, I'm really sick.” The public affairs officer was very preoccupied, I
                    suppose by her pension plan. There was no responsiveness from the American
                    embassy, and I had been very close, always, with the French embassy. I found it
                    very much easier to speak with them. They were not playing the first role in
                    diplomacy in Haiti. And since I love the French, I love Paris, and they were
                    just nicer to me. All of thethe DCM's, the ambassadors, the political officers,
                    with exceptions, of course. I just mentioned to my friend who was the DCM at the
                    time of the French embassy that I'm really in bad shape. I have to get out of
                    here. He sent, immediately, a cable to the defense minister in Paris, and the
                    defense minister cabled him that I had authorization to leave Haiti on one of
                    these Hercules.</p>
                <p>And so the night before, I slept at the French embassy, and a motorcade crossed
                    war-torn Port-au-Prince, and there on the airfield were two Hercules transport
                    planean American and a French. Destination: the Dominican Republic. I went onto
                    the French one. The American one? Damn their eyes.</p>
                <pb facs="0081" n="Page0081"/>
                <p>In October 1993, as a result of what was known as the Governor's Island Accord, a
                    cobbled-together agreement, which had as much chance of standing up as an
                    agreement between two teenage potheads, to get a pro-Aristide government and
                    Aristide would return at a certain time and the general would step down and la
                    la la. Absolutely idiotic. There would be this American supply ship that would
                    arrive in Port-au-Prince to begin the process. It was so stupid. I just don't
                    have the time or the energy to go into this complex idiocthis agreement that had
                    been cobbled together at Governor's Island in New York City.</p>
                <p>So here comes the ship and the rumor starts that they're soldiers. They're not
                    suppliers. The militia that the army had used to control the country because the
                    army was really smalonly a couple thousand, seven thousanand they got this
                    militithugs, killers, former soldiers, out-of-work thieves, trigger-happy
                    lunatics. They called that the FRAPH, which was a pun on the Creole word for
                    “strike” or “blow.” And they showed up and they paraded on the wharf. “If they
                    come, we'll shoot.” Somebody kicked the ambassador's car. It was incredible. It
                    was so incredible. I have to speculate. First of all, this is the United States.
                    The United States has informants. I know they had informants in the militia, the
                    FRAPH. Don't ask me how I know. And this handful of thugs frightens off a supply
                    ship of the United States?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is Harlan County?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORTON: Yah, Harlan County. And has the gall to kick the black limousine of the
                    ambassador of the United States? Now, I would say that somehow the thugs were
                    encouraged, and that the American embassy was not aware of it unless, of course,
                    they had some kind of deal with the car repair man to fix the body and it was
                    some kind of... I would say that it was a show and that part of the embassy was
                    aware of it and part of the embassy wasn't.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Vicki Huddleston was in the car, I believe.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORTON: Right. So the charg� was in the car. It must have scared her. After a
                    while you could interview her. It would be one of the exciting points of her
                    life. She was rewarded later with the ambassadorship to Madagascar, I believe,
                    where things were calmer. I'm sure this was one of the high points of her life.
                    It probably was. I think that the Company had arranged it and the Company wanted
                    the army to stay on as long as possible.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What happened to you on that day?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0082" n="Page0082"/>
                <p>NORTON: Anyways, so there I was covering the event, on the spot as always,
                    breathing the fumes and the dust, getting sunburned. I wasn't yet carrying the
                    tumor under my arm. That was a recurrence of melanoma that I had in 1998, a
                    tumor on my back. After the recurrence in 2003, I think I wanted to die because
                    I didn't see any reason to go on living and so I didn't treat it. But I had an
                    opportunity to die on the day in question.</p>
                <p>I was with an editor from the central office of AP and we covered that event and
                    we ran back and forth. Then we went along Seaside Boulevard. We had heard that a
                    senator had arrived and had shuffled off to the embassy, so we thought we'd get
                    a quote from him. You know, you need a quote from an American official to make
                    the article look official. So off we went on foot to the American embassy which
                    was not that far away.</p>
                <p>There we are in front of the American embassy. One of the trucks full of militia
                    men bristling with assault weapons followed us and parked across the street from
                    us. I would say that presence was hostile. They didn't insult us. I want to be
                    absolutely truthful, so, if this were a court of law, I couldn't say I had been
                    threatened. But they didn't stop for any dead dogs, and they stopped right in
                    front of us. Right in front of the entrance to the American embassy, across the
                    street from us.</p>
                <p>And my friend, especially, became rather upset, and we rattled the gates of the
                    American embassy. “Let us in! Let us in! Here's our passports. We're Americans.
                    You see across the street? These are threatening...” and they refused to let us
                    in. We were turned away from the American embassy with a truck full of hostile
                    thugs. We had our papers. We had a reason to be there. They hadn't any orders to
                    allow anybody in. I suppose it was locked down. After all, somebody had kicked
                    the limousine of the ambassador. I mean, they may kick the wall of the embassy.
                    Of course, if they shot us dead in front of them, that would have been less
                    important. That was a lesson not learned, but it was a lesson. I have not
                    forgotten. You don't ask the U.S. embassy if you're nobody for special treatment
                    at any time. You will not get it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The date of that incident?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORTON: I believe it was the thirteenth of October, 1993.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Mike, let's have a general comment from you, if you're
                        willing, on the people you met in Haitwhether they were American diplomats,
                        whether they were Haitian bourgeoisie, Haitian workers, American
                        politicians, other journalists from other countries, diplomats from the U.S.
                        but also from France, Spain, Mexico, Canada, and the temporary visitors
                        (some people call them the parachute visitors who come from international
                        organizations or the press to have a look at things and to try to find
                        solutions) any general comments on the various strata of people you got to
                        know?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0083" n="Page0083"/>
                <p>NORTON: Again, it's such a varied group. The job of many of them was to come down
                    and make an evaluation as objective, that is to say as fair-minded, as possible.
                    That includes by and large the journalists. Not always. There were puff pieces
                    that were op eds at the beginning, especially. With the troubles in '86 until
                    the fall of Aristide, many of the journalists were embedded in the embassy. That
                    was clear. It was a strange country and they didn't know what to do. So, gosh,
                    you get the American ambassador and that's always the feather in your cap. For
                    some reason, if you can get the American ambassador into your story, that's
                    really wonderful. That's a contradiction, in fact. Your mission is to get a hold
                    of the situation and not to promote a policy, and you don't get from diplomats
                    an evaluation of the situation no matter how it's couched. It's always part of
                    policy.</p>
                <p>So, you have the press, which, in my opinion, in Haiti, improved, gradually
                    leaving the bar stool, leaving the marine guards at the American embassy, and
                    going out, talking to people, and getting to know the country. Again, I am not
                    heavily criticizing that because it was a strange country unknown to most of
                    them. You had to speak French to talk to the people, la cr�me, but basically you
                    had to speak Creole or you had to have a translator. It's never really good, in
                    my opinion, to need a translator. You need someone because you have to, because
                    you don't speak Arabic or whatever. But you never know who's going to check up
                    on the translator. You never know who you're dealing with.</p>
                <p>Anyways, it was not easy for journalists, and so they took the line of least
                    resistance. That became less and less true. As it became less and less true for
                    the diplomats and the officials who were in Haiti, they became more and more
                    sensitive to the complexity of the situation without necessarily committing
                    themselves. Their commitment was to their job. That's true of everybody. Their
                    commitment was to their job. It was their mission whether it was to tell the
                    truth and nothing but the truth so help me God or my publisher or my editor or
                    my career, or to see how things were going and how possible it was or was not to
                    implement the policy. This being the case, you had some people who were
                    wonderfully intelligent and not doofuses at all who let me know they didn't
                    believe what was going on, especially the long period of negotiation. There were
                    high officials who were very, very savvy and winked, but again, their commitment
                    is to their organization. That meant that it was not always amusing to meet
                    these people.</p>
                <p>I had some good journalist buddies and we could laugh a little, but you don't
                    laugh with officials. I remember there was once this assessment by CARICOM and a
                    question period. The leader of the delegation, who was a foreign minister, I
                    believe of St. Lucia, and he talked about the fledgling democracy in Haiti.
                    That's one of the models/clich�s. Haiti is a country without a democratic
                    tradition, it takes time, etc. Of course, I always said, “It certainly takes
                    time. Everything takes time, but you have to begin in order to say it will take
                    a long of time.” That never was the case in Haiti.</p>
                <pb facs="0084" n="Page0084"/>
                <p>Well, with the referendum of the Constitution, that was year 1 or year 0, but it
                    didn't last very long, did it? Anyways, phrases, phrases, platitudes, bromides,
                    lack of humor, lack of wit. It wasn't very much fun. So I asked for a comment on
                    the word, “fledgling democracy,” and I asked him whether or not he didn't think
                    it was rather an unfledged democracy and whether the bird metaphor was apt in
                    the situation. “What do you think about the nest and that what you have in the
                    nest is a bird's egg, and the creature moving about in the nest is a lizard?” He
                    didn't laugh. He didn't think it was funny. Maybe you don't think it's
                    funny.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I do!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORTON: Anyways, that was, in fact, Haiti. There was an egg in the nest and there
                    was a lizard in the nest, and the lizard was about to consume the last best hope
                    of the dead bird who had laid that egg. That sort of thing happened all the
                    time. You couldn't get a rise out of these people. Dead serious. Dead serious
                    because their commitment was to their job, their office, their mission. Not
                    Haiti. There are lots of jokes in history, but history is no joke.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You may have just answered this question, but I propose we
                        end this third interview with your assessment of the OAS and how they
                        behaved and what they achieved, if anything, in the last decade before
                        Aristide's departure.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORTON: Again, I'm not so clear about the motives. I'm not so clear about whether
                    the objective was to get anything done or just to march in place. I don't know.
                    It's obvious that their objective, which was to get people to sit down at the
                    table and work on a negotiation, was a complete failure. Their persistence was
                    remarkable and funny. Of course, it was a joke I could share with nobody. Luigi
                    Einaudi was, I think, a smart man, but you couldn't get a rise out of him on the
                    subject. He kept on coming back, kept on coming back, 25, 26 times, I don't
                    know. It was completely ridiculous as though, how is it possible that these
                    Haitians can be so stubborn? What's the matter with them? We're the OAS. We're
                    big people. Who do they think they are? Haitians think a lot of themselves. They
                    are the descendants of the freed and unfreed slaves who ousted the master, who
                    defeated the French colonial army, the greatest army the world had ever seen.
                    Well, of course a good deal of time has passed, but that megalomania is part of
                    the Haitian character. That's who they are. I find that not funny. I find that
                    touching. After all, Haitian independence is one of the glories of world
                    history.</p>
                <pb facs="0085" n="Page0085"/>
                <p>The problem, of course, is that Haitian leadership has not been a very worthy
                    custodian of it. Who are these guys? They just don't come to reason. Lovely,
                    another word, reason. Come to reason. They don't come to reason. I spoke to
                    these people. Their reason is not your reason. Their criteria are not your
                    criteria. These are people who are possessed by gods, who can be possessed by
                    gods. Haiti is a country that has a greater population of dead spirits walking
                    about than live bodies. This is a country that functions, to a large extent, on
                    black magic. It's not what you think. This is a country of carnival. This is a
                    former slave society. It's still a slave society in many ways. Haitians are not
                    individuals in the way that you are an individual. Their individuality is lived
                    in a different way. Who are they to defy the OAS? Who are those soldiers who
                    took that ball, made a touchdown, and kept on running. What's the matter with
                    them? Come on back!</p>
                <p>Well they didn't want to come on back. As I said, they didn't understand that
                    it's, “Yes massa,” and when you turn your back, they jump on you and slit your
                    throat. They didn't understand that, and that was funny. Their naivet�, their
                    subtlety. I mean, I don't know what they were doing. They're too subtle for me.
                    Their subtlety in the face of this extraordinary distinction of cultures was
                    enormously funny.</p>
                <p>The last time I saw Luigi Einaudi was in a hotel where the negotiations were
                    going on. I don't know. I like a lot of people I guess I shouldn't like. I like
                    people. Why not confess it? I didn't like Aristide. He was just too evil and
                    oof, he scared the shit out of me. But I liked a lot of soldiers. And I liked
                    some of Aristide's followers. And I liked Luigi Einaudi. His persistence. He was
                    doomed. I am not an excommunicator.</p>

                </p>
                <p>NORTON: Trying to get people to sit down at the same table. Of course, there was
                    no table, in fact. Anyways, he was walking out of the conference room and I was
                    beside him. And, as we walked in the hotel, a large vase leaned over and fell.
                    Nobody touched it. And I said, “Mr. Einaudi, welcome to Vodou. Nobody touched
                    that vase, you walked by, and it fell over. You're a big man.”</p>

                <p>This is Dan Whitman interviewing Mike Norton. The fourth interview, this one in
                    the afternoon of September 7th, 2007.</p>
                <p>Mike, on April 3rd, 2000, an assassination took place - at the time, Haiti's
                    best-known journalist, Jean Dominique. Can you tell me what went through your
                    mind that day?</p>
                <pb facs="0086" n="Page0086"/>
                <p>NORTON: Haiti's best-known journalist. That's the lead of all of our articles. It
                    is, of course, extremely misleading. He was Haiti's best-known, we'll talk about
                    what he was best-known as. Jean Dominique, “Jean Do” to his familiars. I was not
                    one of his familiars. I knew him very well. I crossed his path frequently. I was
                    often attacked on his radio station. Jean Dominique was not the legend that has
                    been made of him. Jonathan Demme made a film. He called it The Agronomist. He
                    was trained as an agronomist, but, again, this is my view of Jean Dominique,
                    that's misleading. He had that capacity. He had a vision for the Haitian
                    peasants. There's no question about that. He died trying to set up a peasant
                    union, but he wasn't an agronomist. Jean Dominique was a political animal.
                    Political in every fiber of his body. Anyways, in every fiber of the body I ever
                    saw and came into contact with. Power. Power to decide. Power to guide. Power to
                    control. Power to direct. All of those infinitives. Anything that had to do with
                    power. He was not a politician, but he was a political animal. Jean Dominique
                    was not a journalist. Jean Dominique was a power in Haiti, and that power that
                    he manifested in the 1970's was magnificent.</p>
                <p>It took a lot of courage to face off against the Duvaliers. Jean Dominique, by
                    giving birth to the free press movement, announced the freedom to come,
                    announced the new power, a power that would take into consideration the people,
                    the vast majority of the people. Their needs, their desires, their aspirations,
                    that would wrest it from the hands of a small minority. That small minoritthe
                    military, the upper claswas Jean Dominique's enemy. Jean Dominique had an idea
                    of justice that was one of class justice. In many ways, he was as archaic as his
                    opponents. He very easily dismissed people because of their association. On
                    several occasions on his radio stationhe was an editorialist on his radio
                    statiohe would attack the international press, the wire services, as agents of
                    imperialism. This was his opinion. It was never based on anything.</p>
                <p>Jean Dominique was responsible for having several people thrown into prison.
                    Enemies that belonged to that class, the hated class of the bourgeoisie and the
                    military. The idea of a fair trial, of the truths appearing never was
                    particularly one of his considerations. He wasn't interested in that. He was
                    interested in a new class arriving to power, a class that would open the
                    possibilities of the future to the vast majority.</p>
                <p>Jean Dominique was not a journalist. He was the owner of a radio station and an
                    editorialist. On occasion, if you wish, a journalist, but it was not his thing.
                    He was not interested in ferreting out the truth. He was interested in
                    denouncing. He was interested in forming an opinion. Jean Dominique was an
                    opinion maker. Jean Dominique was also the eminence grise of Aristide for a
                    while, and for the current president, Ren� Pr�val. Jean Dominique did not have
                    the scruples of a journalist. Jean Dominique accused. Jean Dominique led people
                    to believe with his irony, with his sarcasm, and, at times, with his downright
                    nastiness. All of this is not very politically correct to say about this man
                    who, after all, did die heroically, and I'll come to that in a moment.</p>
                <pb facs="0087" n="Page0087"/>
                <p>I cried two times. I wept bitter tears two times for Haiti during my stay. One
                    was on the 29th of November 1987 when the army crushed the mass democratic
                    movement as it was on the way to the polls, and the second was on April 3, 2000,
                    when Jean Dominique was killed. The two events are very much tied together. Jean
                    Dominique was the voice, in 1970, of a new future, of a new power, of a new
                    distribution of power. In fact, that possibility had already been nipped in the
                    bud in 1987, in my opinion. The leadership had demonstrated itself absolutely
                    incompetent to lead Haiti anywhere than in a circle, a deepening circle, a
                    deepening disastrous circle. People lost somethinthe hope, the certainty of
                    ultimate victory. Jean Dominique announced that victory before the people took
                    him up on it. They were tied together, but, in fact, in my opinion, it was dead
                    before Jean Dominique was killed.</p>
                <p>But Jean Dominique did die heroically. Jean Dominique, who prided himself on his
                    independence of power, of course, because the power he attacked was dictatorial
                    and he was advocating another power, was, in fact, working hand in glove with
                    Aristide. He called Aristide “the Prophet” before he became president. He was
                    Aristide's man. Aristide could count on him. He also had the ear of Ren� Pr�val
                    (1996-2000) when Pr�val was in power advising him, I think advising him to try
                    to find an independent basis of power independent of Aristide. Jean Dominique
                    tried to form an independent peasant union which was destroyed by Aristide.</p>
                <p>(A word might be appropriate here on the biblical notion of false prophesy. From
                    Jeremiah 14: “ 'A lying vision, an empty divination, the deceit of their own
                    contriving—that is what they prophesy to you! Assuredly,' thus said the Lord
                    concerning the prophets who prophesy 'in My name though I have not sent them,
                    and who say, “Sword and famine shall not befall this land”; those very prophets
                    shall perish by sword and famine. And the people to whom they prophesy shall be
                    left lying in the streets of Jerusalem because of the famine and the sword, with
                    none to bury them.'")</p>
                <p>Jean Dominique, gradually in the months before the election or the weeks before
                    the legislative election in the year 2000, suddenly changed the tone. I noticed
                    this the week before his assassination. I also noticed that he approached the
                    American embassy. He wanted to interview somebody from the American embassy. He
                    wanted to interview me. That meant, in his mind, he was trying to widen his
                    base. He saw me as an antenna, as an extension of the American embassy. That's
                    the way he thought. He wanted to interview me. He wanted to interview somebody
                    from the American embassy. And in his programs, it became clear that some of the
                    information that didn't come out before was coming out.</p>
                <pb facs="0088" n="Page0088"/>
                <p>There was violence in the provinces, election-related violence, and he clearly
                    stated that the perpetrators were members of Aristide's party. I couldn't
                    believe it. This began about a week or so before his assassination. I couldn't
                    believe it. I said, “Oh my God, what's happening?” What was happening was, for
                    some reason, Jean Dominique didn't agree with Aristide anymore and began to see
                    him as somebody who had to be stopped. One of the reasons was that Aristide was
                    an advocate of black power. Advocate...he was using racism to try and win over
                    the population that he was losing. One of his supporters, a former soldier and
                    then senator, made incendiary remarks against Jean Dominique, and black power
                    seemed to be on the rise. Jean Dominique was from an upper class mulatto family.
                    He hated the bourgeoisie, but he was not a racist. He saw the handwriting on the
                    wall, in my opinion, had ambitions, even though people close to him deny that he
                    had presidential ambitions.</p>
                <p>I don't see him running for president either, he was the fourth estate. I think
                    he was moving toward a propaganda attack against Aristide. And he was killed on
                    the third of April. He was killed while recovering his independent voice, and
                    that was moving and that was great and that, for me, redeemed him in my eyes,
                    for Jean Dominique was nothing for me more than a lackey of power of the Lavalas
                    power for a number of years. And he saw the error of his ways.</p>
                <p>And he returned to the fold. I was very deeply moved. I was deeply moved and
                    moved to tears. The hope of Haiti was, I think, extinguished before Jean
                    Dominique died, but that independent stand was heroic. Heroism was still
                    possible in Haiti, and what Jean Dominique would have become was nipped in the
                    bud.</p>
                <p>Who killed Jean Dominique, I don't know, but one thing I can tell you, nothing I
                    say will stand up in court, nothing happens in a country like Haiti, nothing of
                    that nature can happen without the tacit approval or explicit order of the
                    president. That's all I can say. Things don't just happen.</p>
                <p>A man was asked to be Culture Minister by Aristide. He turned it down. The next
                    day his wife was shot in the head. A friend of mine, outraged for some reason,
                    invited to the palace, told Aristide off, said that she didn't believe he was
                    going down the right path. She didn't agree and would not support him. A week
                    later she was attacked by four thugs and was gang raped. Coincidence? What a
                    strange coincidence. And the stories that don't come to mind readily which other
                    people have certainly recorded, are legion. Coincidences? The president in
                    Haiti, so long as he has power, is a mythological being. To be president is an
                    obsession with people. They dream of it. I'm talking about people who have a
                    certain amount of power or education. Literally dream about it.</p>
                <pb facs="0089" n="Page0089"/>
                <p>I had one friend who later became president of one of the many electoral
                    councils, and I asked him, “Now why did you take on this terribly difficult
                    job?” He said, “Well, I didn't want it. The Catholic Church who chose me to be
                    their representative on it did. Except that one night I was dreaming and I
                    dreamt I was in church, and, as I left the church, I heard a voice saying,
                    'Where are you going, Mr. President? Where are you going, Mr. President?'" For
                    him, this was a clear designation by heavenly powers that he be president of the
                    electoral council, and that, he told me, is why he accepted. Every Haitian young
                    boy dreams of becoming president obviously because it's a country which is very
                    oppressed, where powerlessness is the rule and the president is the Supreme
                    Power. Again, when I say supreme power, put S and put P in capital letters; it's
                    mythological. It's not Mr. President. You don't dare do things in a country like
                    that the way you do them in a country like the United States. Satire is very
                    dangerous unless, of course, the president is losing power, in which case there
                    are no limits to the hatred that is expressed toward him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: On April 3, 2000, the president of Haiti was Ren� Pr�val.
                        Explain the relationship between Ren� Pr�val and Jean-Bertrand
                        Aristide.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORTON: Ren� Pr�val was an activist, attended Aristide's sermons before the fall
                    of Duvalier. He joined a group of upper class people who were trying to concoct
                    some presidential candidate after the fall of Duvalier. It was an upper class
                    group, and they didn't want any of the presidential candidates already there.
                    They wanted something new. They groomed Aristide, in fact. Aristide had the
                    touch. Aristide had magic. Aristide had charisma. Aristide could rouse people.
                    He certainly could in small groups. He was amazing. In large groups it was
                    different, but in small groups he could inspire them in a kind of call and
                    response interaction. Sermons. Participatory sermons using symbols that
                    everybody understood but that couldn't make him blamable by the power in place.
                    Remarkable man.</p>
                <p>And they approached, and they made continual advances toward Aristide until
                    finally Aristide, who I think always wanted to run for president, did run for
                    president in 1990. Ren� Pr�val was a member of his group, and when Aristide had
                    to choose his partners, he chose Ren� Pr�val to the astonishment of everyone
                    associated with Aristide in the back halls of power, the total astonishment.
                    Ren� Pr�val was a street activist. He owned a bakery, I think. He had some job
                    as an accountant. He was not particularly articulate, really very modest, and
                    suddenly he's promoted to prime minister. Well, Aristide believed he could
                    control him and Aristide wasn't wrong. Aristide proceeded, when he was president
                    for the first time, to cut all attachment to the party that had nominated him,
                    to any other party, and to begin his own thing in complete independence. It was,
                    in fact, a movement that isolated him from his base, that weakened him finally
                    when the new power had to confront the military.</p>
                <pb facs="0090" n="Page0090"/>
                <p>Ren� Pr�val didn't do a very good job according to the Parliament, and in August
                    they tried to censure him. He was very clear. He said, “Censure me. I'm not
                    going.” And Aristide told the Parliamentarians in private, “If you censure him,
                    I'm going to make a speech to the people and you'll see what happens.”</p>
                <p>The day that the censure was to take place, the Parliament was surrounded by
                    Aristide's thugs, and then it was really rowdy. Pr�val was not censured, and,
                    when Aristide was overthrown by the army in September 1991, I think he went to
                    the French embassy and spent many difficult, difficult months in the embassy
                    until he finally was able to go into exile, returned and was Aristide's
                    candidate and spent the next couple of years unable to find an independent
                    political base in spite of the help of Jean Dominique. He didn't have any ideas.
                    His ideas weren't that different from Aristide. That's part of it. He didn't
                    have an independent personality, and since there were such great difficulties
                    between the legislature and the executive, finally he shut them out or he called
                    the closure of the parliament, and he appointed his own prime minister and ruled
                    by executive decree. This caused all kinds of problems with the international
                    community, but he went on until the end of his term.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: On April 3, 2000, who had the power?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORTON: Aristide had the power, but Pr�val was in power. Look, I think it was
                    shortly after he took power, gunmen attacked his sister, shot his sister. You
                    know? That doesn't happen just like that. He was under a death threat. Today, he
                    is president, overwhelmed by problems, short of imagination, and heir to all of
                    the problems I already mentioned. But Aristide isn't there, so, if he fails, he
                    has nobody to blame.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The last point, maybe two, on the death of Jean Dominique.
                        His widow, Michelle Montas, survived him and is currently the spokesperson
                        for the Secretary General of the United Nations. Do you have a sense of
                        where she fit into the whole constellation in early 2000?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORTON: Michelle Montas was the journalist. She was the head of the newsroom. She
                    has a degree from the Columbia School of Journalism. As I said, her husband was
                    a power broker, not a journalist. He was an opinion maker. Michelle Montas
                    ensured the integrity of the news that came out of their station which was
                    Haiti-Inter. Jean Dominique controlled all.</p>
                <pb facs="0091" n="Page0091"/>
                <p>Michelle Montas, I don't understand her reaction after. Perhaps it was fear. I
                    don't understand why she has not made any accusations. Again, maybe it's
                    fairness. Maybe she doesn't feel that there's any justification to, but, as I
                    said, nothing happens in a country like Haiti without some sort of agreement
                    from the president, and that man is Jean-Bertrand Aristide. I don't see any
                    motive from any other sector of the society. Jean Dominique always attacked the
                    supporters of the former dictatorial regimes. There was nothing special about
                    April 2000. There was only one thing special about April 2000, which was that
                    the country was entering a new electoral period that would culminate in the
                    return to power of Jean-Bertrand Aristide, and her husband had changed his
                    tune.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yesterday you suggested that “the state” marked a change
                        in the Haitian culture and the Haitian values. You said just now that your
                        hope for Haiti's future had been snuffed out or compromised long before that
                        date, but can you see implications for the Haitian society tied to that
                        date, the date of his assassination?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORTON: If Jean Dominique had lived, if Jean Dominique had been able to lay out
                    an alternative to Aristide's power, maybe things would have been different. I
                    doubt it because Jean Dominique was archaic. They had no particular fondness for
                    forms. Constitutional, legislative, or executive...I think maybe things would
                    have been different, but the megalomaniac idea that somehow I know what's good
                    for the country and I will be able to do what's good for the country...that's so
                    common in Haiti and yet the poverty of ideas is also flagrant. I think it would
                    have been another cult of personality.</p>
                <p>Jean Dominique died at the summit, as I said, heroically, because he recovered
                    his independent voice, which didn't mean that he became a lover of the truth or
                    a lover of justice, but his idea of power changed. The reluctance or
                    unwillingness or refusal of his wife to shake the bars, shake the gate of the
                    presidential palace was perhaps a political move. The ethical stance would have
                    been different.</p>
                <p>I remember when, several years before, a very prominent individual was
                    assassinated by the military. It was under the government of Pascal Trouillot, I
                    think, in 1991, and that transitional president was governing with the State
                    Council. One of the State Council members was gunned down. It was obviously
                    complicity between the executive and...what had happened because the State
                    Council and the executive were in a conflict of power. They didn't agree on
                    certain things and who was stepping on whose toes? It was a tense moment, and in
                    that tense moment, Serge Villard was gunned down. And I remember the funeral. I
                    remember the Information Minister coming to extend his sympathy and pay his
                    respects to the widow, Mrs. Villard. He came into the chapel and approached her.
                    She refused to touch his hand. I think she got up and told him to go. That was
                    not very political, was it?</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0092" n="Page0092"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORTON: I was the one who called Mrs. Villard and told her that her husband had
                    been wounded. I called her. I felt close to her. The admiration I felt for her
                    transcends the categories that dominate Haitian mind. The ethical stand: you are
                    a member of a government. I'm not saying that you killed him, but you are
                    responsible for the death of my husband. I will not touch your hand, and I
                    refuse to admit your presence in my presence. Isn't that what it means to be a
                    human being? And to honor the memory of her husband? Shut down the political
                    shop. Michelle Montas did not shut down the political shop, and that's all I
                    have to say about it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's approach some conclusions. You've given a number of
                        hours of your recollections, your trajectory from childhood until your
                        departure from Haiti in 2004. Would you like to comment on, shifting gears
                        here, now you've made a distinction between the press and journalism. You've
                        made a distinction between the objectives of journalists as professionals
                        and of diplomats as professionals. Can you comment on the difference of the
                        mission of doing and the mission of observing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORTON: Yes. I think the case of Jean Dominique will exemplify the first
                    distinction. The press is a power. Its goal is power. It influences. It is what
                    publishers of newspapers do. It's why publishers buy newspapers: so that they
                    can influence policy. It's a power. It forms public opinion which, in
                    democracies, counts. No one's going to contest that the press is a power.</p>
                <p>In Haiti, the press was a power for the democratic movement, and often very
                    heroic. Jean Dominique, in fact, isn't the only one, but he gave birth to that
                    new power. After the fall of Duvalier, dozens of radio stations sprung up. You
                    could, and I did, from three o'clock in the morning until ten o'clock at night,
                    listen to one radio station after another in a constant stream of news. I don't
                    know of any other country where that is possible. My radios were on from two
                    forty five, I think it was, until eight or nine o'clock, until I couldn't stand
                    it anymore. I went from one station to the other, one station to the other. What
                    was happening? Hundreds of journalists were out on the street. Paid with
                    pennies, struggling, and of course sometimes there were corrupt journalists, but
                    by and large, the Haitian press was a power for democracy. Again, a power.</p>
                <p>Journalists, it's different. In Haiti, and I think elsewhere, too, the
                    distinction is forgotten. Journalists are workers. If they work hard, they may
                    acquire authority. The goal of a journalist is to acquire authority. I trust
                    him! Hey, guys, did you hear what he said? I trust him. He has authority because
                    he's earned a badge.</p>
                <pb facs="0093" n="Page0093"/>
                <p>So the press is about power, and journalism is about authority, and journalists
                    are workers. And they should organize as workers and they have to often deal
                    with owners of the media that want them to say one thing rather than another
                    because their business is power. Their business is not the truth. Truth and
                    power are uneasy bed fellows. For many years in Haiti, there was no ambiguity.
                    The press wanted democracy. Except what is democracy? Well, we found out, didn't
                    we? The so-called participatory democracy of Aristide that Jean Dominique
                    supported for many years was one form of democracy. His power, the power of his
                    press, became for me ambiguous. But he was at least clear. Other stations didn't
                    take such strong stands. So that's an important distinction.</p>
                <p>In the United States there are embedded journalists, especially in Washington.
                    Aren't there? And they are used as instruments of power. They have forgotten
                    that their job is not just to interview State Department officials or Defense
                    Department officials but to investigate the whole picture. The New York Times
                    before Iraq is the best example, but also the series of anti- or the pro-Bush
                    books by the Washington Post reporter, Woodward's more or less pro-Bush series
                    of books. And then finally when the wind is turning, he comes out with a book
                    contesting the wisdom of the leaders. He's in bed with them. He socializes with
                    them. And I understand very well it's a temptation. You forget it and they
                    become your pals. You forget that you're a journalist and that you're not a
                    power broker.</p>
                <p>Very often, I was tempted. I had a lot to do with everyone in power. I knew the
                    presidents. I knew the ministers. I knew the politicians. I talked to them. Wow.
                    And what if I said something, what if I reported an event that reflected badly
                    upon them? In Haiti, they don't forgive.</p>
                <p>Leslie Fran�ois Manigat was a personal friend for many years from before, from
                    the 1970's. He became president in 1988 as the result of a rigged election. If
                    Mr. Manigat reads this interview and hears that I believe that he was president
                    because of a rigged election, an election rigged by the military, he will never
                    speak to me again. Well, we're both pretty old. He'll probably never speak to me
                    again anyways, but incredible. People called me on the phone and insulted me
                    because I had put them in the same article as a political enemy. Can you
                    imagine? “You put me in the same article with that SOB?” “But you didn't say
                    what he said; you said the opposite.” “But you put me in the same...” I mean, I
                    put them in bed? That did not happen once. And then you lose a source. And then
                    what do you do when something happens? It's very, very difficult.</p>
                <p>When you're a journalist embedded in the country or embedded in the milieu, when
                    you're a Washington Beat journalist, you have to have the source. If you don't
                    have the sources, you don't have a job. And in my case, it was so easy.
                    Sometimes it was dangerous. In the coup d'�tat, it was more than dangerous to
                    report the misdeeds of the military. It meant that I had the militia at my door.
                    That happened. You have to go into hiding. That happens. But you have to be
                    clear. You're not the power broker if you're a journalist. You don't own your
                    medium. You are a worker. You work for them. And sometimes at cross purposes
                    because you have a different objective. You're lucky when you work together, but
                    it's not essentially the case.</p>
                <pb facs="0094" n="Page0094"/>
                <p>So far as the journalist and the diplomat, the diplomat has a mission to
                    accomplish. He may not agree with it and he may inform the State Department or
                    the embassy, that things aren't really the way they are believed to be, but he's
                    there to represent his country. He's there to carry out a policy. And he will
                    justify it whether it's justifiable or not.</p>
                <p>A journalist, if he's worth his salt, has a mission to evaluate a situatioto get
                    the facts, to interview the key players, to give the reader a sense of the lay
                    of the land. He doesn't have a policy. If he depends upon the embassy, for
                    example, as chief source, he will skew things totally. That happened often at
                    the beginning of my career in Haiti for foreign journalists, especially the big
                    ones, who came down and basically were informed by the American embassy and
                    their credible informants. So these are distinctionthe distinction between the
                    power and authority, the press and journalism, and, in between, the mission to
                    accomplish and the mission to inform. They, when I speak like that, seem so
                    separate, but when you are in the field, it's confusing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Confusing in what ways? In what ways can a mission of
                        accomplishment and a mission of finding the truth intersect or contradict
                        each other? And taking back to the comment about Adams...I had something to
                        do...your belief of responsibility as a journalist...you responded to that
                        before. I want to give you another chance to think that over.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORTON: The diplomat may have a just evaluation of the situation, but it's only
                    part of the picture. You're taken in, and also you're human as a journalist. You
                    like these people. You trust these people. You don't realize, it's not that
                    they're trying to pull the wool over your eyes, you're at cross purposes.
                    They're not trying to abuse you. He's just giving a mission to accomplish as a
                    piece of information. You know, it's not flagged as a mission to accomplish. You
                    believe him, you trust him, and you assess the situation that way, too. And then
                    you're lost because you can't take your cues from people who have missions to
                    accomplish. That's how it's confusing. You can't take your cues from
                    people...I'll give you an example.</p>
                <p>I think it's a beautiful example. The 2000, it was the first round of the 2000
                    legislative elections. I was there with a very experienced reporter from the
                    Central Bureau who had covered many elections in Africa. I had covered several
                    in Haiti, but she had covered many in Africa. It was a mess. The dishonesty was
                    patent. Ballot boxes burst open and ballots strewn in the street, miscounting,
                    you name it. It was visibly a mess, but the international community wanted Haiti
                    to go away. They wanted the pain in the ass to go away, but instead of taking
                    Ibuprofen, they took morphine.</p>
                <pb facs="0095" n="Page0095"/>
                <p>Now, morphine is hallucinatory. A very dear friend, who was Public Affairs
                    Officer at the French embassy, took some French officials around and came back
                    to me radiant saying, “This is one of the most beautiful elections I've ever
                    seen.” I thought I was going crazy. This was my very dear friend. The press, the
                    big presI think the Post, the New York Times, I'm not sure which ones, but the
                    most important onereported a fantastic advance in the electoral experience in
                    this country without a democratic tradition. It was a great election! Wow, they
                    got a legislature afoot that is going to be legitimate and things are going to
                    be good. And there won't be any more boat people, and we can turn our attention
                    to what? But not to this little bitty country that's driving us crazy. And
                    that's dirty and who knows what. We, The Associated Press, reported a shambles.
                    We reported highly irregular voting, highly irregular tallying. My friend who
                    knew from Africa said she had never seen something as bad, anything as bad, in
                    Africa. Well, I've seen elections as bad in Haiti, but it sort of put things in
                    perspective. And we stuck to the story.</p>
                <p>The next day, I think it was at a press conference, we were blackballed, shunned
                    by all of the reporters. I think one of the big editors, maybe it was the
                    Washington Post, called our head office to complain about us. Luckily, the head
                    office said, “They are the reporters in the field. We do not influence their
                    reporting.” Two or three days later, the IRI (International Republican
                    Institute) came down. Porter Goss was the head at that time. Not exactly my cup
                    of tea, but, God, at the time, Haiti was a political football between the
                    Republicans and the Democrats, and so, it was in the interest of the Republican
                    party to tell the truth. Oh, they saved our ass. They gave a beautiful, detailed
                    report on the mishandling of the elections. And there we were. That was the end
                    of the heat. We came out looking very good. We came out triumphant. I mean, The
                    Associated Press had stuck to its guns. The directive was from the embassies,
                    “These are good elections.” They cannot not be good elections. They must be good
                    elections. Therefore, they are good elections. Blinding well-intentioned people.
                    Blinding competent journalists. You don't take your cue from the powers that
                    be.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Not to contradict you, but the United Nations, the OAS,
                        the U.S., the EU, and a number of individual countries, Canada and others,
                        questioned the tabulation process. I think what you're describing is not the
                        tabulation but the actual day of election.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORTON: I'm describing everything. All of that came after. I'm talking about
                    reporting the event. I'm talking about the day. Not a week after when the powers
                    that be said it's really not that good, is it? We can't cover this. I'm talking
                    about the moment. This is the moment. If everybody on the ground had said it was
                    really great, then it would have been really great. We didn't, and in came the
                    IRI to add its power to the situation, and then so it wasn't great. So it was
                    great and then it wasn't great.</p>
                <pb facs="0096" n="Page0096"/>
                <p>We didn't take our cue from the IRI. The IRI didn't follow us; they had their own
                    agenda. What I'm saying is that the reporters that took their cue from the
                    embassies got it all wrong, didn't see. They may have looked, but they didn't
                    see. They may have listened, but they didn't hear. I repeat, you don't take your
                    cues from the powers that be.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We'll add one anecdote from the day of the first
                        elections. I think it was in May. A senior U.S. official, actually during
                        the day of the voting, said, “I see that this is going south. I'm out of
                        here.” That's a quote. He saw what was happening. He never said it publicly,
                        but his response was to simply depart, to say nothing. Mike, let's now go
                        into the final question. What might be the various possible futures for
                        Haiti, and why should we care?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORTON: I'll begin on a positive note. Haiti will survive me. So the door's open.
                    The door's open for a nation. The door's not always open for an individual. So
                    what do I know.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, if you extrapolate from the situation now, extrapolate with no
                    unforeseen event, then the future's not bleak. It's pitch black. If the Haitians
                    don't get an economic development program together, if the Haitians do not get
                    their institutional problems solved, get some coordination between the
                    legislature, the executive if they don't get a judicial system functioning, if
                    they're not able to attract foreign investment and control the nature of that
                    foreign investment so that it's appropriate for its own development goals, if
                    the donor nations do not open a door of altruism, if if if if if, then it's
                    hopeless. What does it mean hopeless? It means Haiti, as we know it, dies. It
                    means Haitians will no longer recognize themselves. This is a subtle concept. I
                    don't know whether I am up to treating it.</p>
                <p>How does a country die? How does a people die? One thing we know is that oodles
                    of peoples have died in the western hemisphere in the last five hundred years.
                    It wouldn't be the first. The original settlers, the aborigines, were killed
                    off. The Haitian people can die, too. How does a people die if they're still
                    alive? It's by losing its identity.</p>
                <p>I'll give you an example. The American people can sicken and wither away if the
                    Republic dies and the American people no longer recognizes itself as a free
                    nation. If the principal value of the American society is securitnot job
                    security, but security from, I don't know, the Huns, the Mongol hordethen
                    America will die. The American tradition will die.</p>
                <p>In Haiti it's more delicate, because a Haitian is a member of a collective entity
                    called Haiti. It's not a country. It's not a place really. Haiti is a state of
                    mind in a certain sense, or rather a soul state. People participate in that. If
                    that whole, if there is no longer a carnival possible in Haiti, if the
                    collective body is no longer vital, if Vodou dies, if people get sick because of
                    black magic and can no longer find the cure because the herbs that would cure
                    have become extinct because there are no longer any trees to protect the
                    vegetation underneath, if Haiti turns into a desert.</p>
                <pb facs="0097" n="Page0097"/>
                <p>Haitians are from Africa. They're from equatorial AfricAngola, Dahomey, places
                    like that, the Congthey're not desert dwellers. If there's no memory cultivated,
                    if even the mythology of Haiti, if the extreme etiquette which governs peasant
                    life is no longer possible to maintain. No population I've ever met is as polite
                    as the illiterate Haitian. There's the tradition, there's an etiquette, courtly
                    etiquettif that dieif on Sunday morning the slum dweller mother no longer braids
                    the hair of her daughter and no longer makes sure that her pinafore is straight
                    and simon pure clean, if that mother doesn't care any more about things like
                    that, Haiti will die. There is only so much suffering that people can take.
                    Haitians can take an awful lot of it, but at a certain moment, the suffering
                    gets the better of life. Pain destroys creativity. Pain. Where were we.
                    Pain...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Destroys creativity.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NORTON: Stop there...</p>
                <p>[Pause]</p>
                <p>Pain is evil. The pain that Haitians can endure and have endured for centuries
                    may become too great in which case Haitians will lose their sense of themselves,
                    will turn into something else. The events of the last few years have shown one
                    taboo after another falling by the wayside. Attacking a church. This was in
                    1988. Attacking a church. You don't attack churches. Stabbing a pregnant
                    womathat took place on the eleventh of September 1988. Stabbing a pregnant woman
                    in the belly with a pig sticker. Certain things that didn't happen before.
                    Kidnapping and torturing a foreigner didn't happen. Certain things didn't
                    happen. There were certain limits.</p>
                <p>Those limits are now extinct. Anything goes. That kind of insecurity may have a
                    temporary low, but the taboo is dead. The harm has been done. When it is all
                    right, when it is a daily occurrence to create such havoc, then the handwriting
                    is on the wall for that society. Certain things can't happen, and, if they do,
                    then that society cannot survive. It will become something else. I don't know
                    what it will become, but Haiti, the Haiti that rose up and freed itself and
                    proclaimed the universality of human rightit's not the French that proclaimed
                    the universality. Well, they may have said it. Instead, it's the Haitians that
                    demanded it and won it. The universality of human rights. That will disappear
                    from the face of the earth.</p>
