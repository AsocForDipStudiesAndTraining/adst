<p>Interviewed by: Ann Miller Morin </p>
<p>Initial interview date: October 28, 1997</p>

<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Would you begin at the beginning?  Tell us where you were born.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Columbia, Missouri, August 28, 1912.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  1912.  And you grew up in Columbia, Missouri?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  That is correct.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Tell me about your mother and father.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  My mother was a graduate of the University of Wisconsin.  She was a singer; graduated in piano and voice, and she taught piano, taught voice, for a long time at Stephens College.  After she was married.  Had a lovely voice.  Lots of vigor and energy.  Wonderful black-eyed woman.  And her family was from Wisconsin.  It was Bewick.  Her Aunt Clara Bewick was a member of the first graduating class of the University of Wisconsin that permitted women.  And I am, see—1, 2—I'm the third generation of college women in our family.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Is Bewick an English name?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Yes.  It's the Thomas Bewick tribe, from Newcastle, England.  She married my father, whose name was Lucas, of French heredity.  He had just started the new business in Columbia, Missouri, when he was married to my mother.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  What sort of business was he in?</hi>
</p>
<pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
<p>GINN:  Books.  College textbooks.  He built a chain of retail stores that spread over much of the central United States and the West Coast.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Really!  Were they called Lucas's'?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  No, the parent company was the “Missouri Book Stores.” There was the “Colorado Bookstore,” and the “California Textbook Exchange,” and many others.  They were designed to give a local identification.  They were all on college campuses.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  What was your father's first name?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Reuben.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  And he was of French origin, you said.  Perhaps his ancestors originally settled in Canada, did they?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  No, they did not.  They came into Virginia, and that was why I asked you about Culpeper; because the earliest reference to them that I can find is in Culpeper County, Virginia.  They were back there before the Revolution.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Your mother's family—how many generation American would they be?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Her father came to this country with his parents when he was three, and they settled in Wisconsin.  He lived there and grew up and then moved, first into Nebraska, and then into Missouri, and ended in the town where he met my mother, which was Nevada, Missouri.  But they were fun people; they had a good time together.  They loved to sing and play the piano together.  Father enjoyed my mother's beautiful voice.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  So your home was full of music.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Full of music and full of laughter, lots of fishing.  My father took me fishing when I was scarcely big enough to carry my own fishing pole.  And I know that's where I learned to enjoy the caterpillars.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Did you have any brothers or sisters?</hi>
</p>
<pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
<p>GINN:  Yes, I have two brothers.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Tell me about them.  Are they older than you?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  No, they're both younger than I.  One is five years younger than I am and the other one is 18 years younger than I am.  They're both living; both live in Columbia.  After my father died, why both of them and Stanley were involved in the book business.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  I see.  Well, if your brothers were that much younger, even the one five years younger, I suppose you didn't play too much with them, did you?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  We didn't have a usual sibling relationship.  But both my parents died when he was—my younger brother was about 15 and he came and lived with Stanley and me.  It was kind of an intermediate generation relationship.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Yes, yes.  Very much the older sister who then became mother, almost.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Yes.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Well, when you were a little girl, did you play mostly with little girls?  Or were your neighbors little boys?  What kind of games did you like to play?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Up 'til the time that I was in probably the second grade, when I was about eight or nine, we lived in a neighborhood where everybody knew everybody else and where I had two wonderful friends who lived on the same street.  I still have that same friendship with those two women.  One is a doctor in Oberlin, Ohio, and the other one is a graduate of the Journalism School of the University of Missouri, and her husband has been a chemist for the government.  They now live out in the State of Washington.  They still keep in contact.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  What kind of things did you like to play together as little girls?</hi>
</p>
<pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
<p>GINN:  Well, I can remember playing under a great oak tree that was in the lawn of the one who was the journalist.  At that time, it was easy to have a “my best friend” type, and it was she.  I would go and sit and wait for hours while she practiced her music lessons, and just listened.  It was a great support because I always wanted a sister and I never had one, so here were two surrogate sisters for me.  The other young woman's father was a professor in the engineering school and he was a great lover of Kipling.  He would read aloud to us.  I can remember spending hours in a window seat in their living room and he would stand in front of the fireplace and read Kipling.  It was good.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  These seem to be rather quiet things you played and did together?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Yes.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Not boisterous.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  No, I don't remember any great boisterous types.</p>
<p>October 29, 1987</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  We talked about your brother's illnesses and your fortunate lack of them, and your mother singing professionally.  Although your mother sang professionally, she was the traditional mother, was she?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Well, she taught—taught voice at Stephens College for about 20 years and was beloved of her co-workers and had many friends.  She was an active, vigorous woman.  I remember one time she walked into a grocery store and saw a very young boy buying a package of cigarettes and she just took it upon herself to lecture the man; after all, tobacco was a terrible thing and he shouldn't be doing that.  She said, “You just put those cigarettes back right there on the counter, young man, and come here with me,” and she took him over and bought him some candy.  Now, I don't know which was worse, really, but she was that kind of an activist.  She started the Free Lunch Program in the Columbia Schools.  Whenever she saw a problem or a need that she felt strongly enough about, why she didn't just sit down and talk about it, she did something about it.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  She was a direct descendant, so to speak, of her Aunt Clara?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Yes, yes.</p>
<p>
<pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  So you are the third generation, not only to go to university, but also to be an activist.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Yes.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Did you look on your mother as your role model, growing up?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  I think very much.  Yes, I think very much, because I admired the energy that she had and her wonderful, positive spirit about things, and her ability when she saw a problem to do something about it.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Were your parents very strict?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  I don't think so.  No, not pressing.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  But there were rules?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Oh, yes; oh, yes.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Did you have any household duties, obligations?  Did you have responsibilities at home?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Not any domestic responsibilities, because Mother taught; and there was always domestic help in the house.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  I see.  From the college?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  No, no.  You see, Columbia had an adequate black population to provide and there were two or three wonderful black people who, throughout all of our young life, were a part of our family. I think that, perhaps, the one that made the greatest impact on the family was Mrs. Tiny Warren.  We all called her Aunt Tiny, and she was tiny.  She was about up to here on me, which makes her less than five feet high.  I remember one time that my brother ran away.  And oh, Mother was flailing about the house:  What should she do; what should she do?  And Aunt Tiny, “Mrs. Lucas, don't you worry.  I get that boy back.” She said, “Let's have steak and onions for supper.” So she fixed the steak and the onions for supper and she opened the back door while she cooked and just about suppertime, here came a very shame-faced little boy.  He'd been hiding out in the loft of the barn.</p>
<p>
<pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  She certainly knew him, didn't she?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  She did.  But she couldn't read or write.  She determined what was in the pantry by the pictures on the cans.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Maybe that's why they always put pictures on the cans.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  It could have been; pretty good, if that was the reason.  It certainly worked.  That was fine until my little brother, who was a family afterthought, got into the pantry one day and tore all the outsides off the cans.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  You must have had an interesting menu.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  We did thereafter 'til the extent of that pantry was depleted.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Sounds as though your family had a lot of fun.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Oh, we did; we did.  My father used to take me fishing with him, and that's where I learned about fish and learned to love to fish.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Did you feel closer to your dad or to your mother?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  I really don't think that I could identify a difference.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  That certainly speaks well of the relationships.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  They had a good relationship; they had a good time together.  And, of course, they both died so young that .  .  .</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Was it in an accident that they died?</hi>
</p>
<pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
<p>GINN:  No, not really.  My mother developed a brain tumor when she was 59, and my father, knowing that she was quite ill, took all the family to Hot Springs for Christmas—brothers, children, grandchildren, everybody.  We stayed at the old Arlington Hotel, and we had a beautiful Christmas dinner there.  My father got up from the table and said, “I have a little headache.” He went upstairs to his room and within an hour he was unconscious and he had a massive cerebral hemorrhage.  He was dead before morning.  My mother lived then about six months after that.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  What a terrible time for your family!  Terrible time.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  They, of course, were 60.  And here I am, 75�, and I see all of the beautiful time that they didn't get to share together.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Their relationship was similar to the one you have with your husband?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Yes.  They had an awfully good time.  They sang and played the piano together, and they shared the same good group of friends.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  You mentioned yesterday that the father of one of your friends read Kipling to you.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Oh, yes, wonderful man.  Dr. Wade Hibbard.  He was a professor in the School of Engineering at the University of Missouri.  I think his family must have been missionaries, because there were things in their home which I still remember which would have had to have come from India.  I really have this feeling; I've never been able to actually identify it, but sitting in the window seat in the living room of that home and hearing him read and enunciate—he was a New Englander, beautiful reading voice.  He would stand in front of the fireplace and read to Jeanne, his daughter, my good friend, and me.  I think it's affected the way I write.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  It certainly could well be, because you were at a very formative period of your life.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  They were a wonderful family and I still keep in touch with daughter, Jeanne.  I know that Mrs. Hibbard always laughed and teased me because I had a very healthy imagination.  One day I went to see Jeanne and Jeanne was not home, but Mrs. Hibbard was.  She was working in the kitchen, so I just kind of followed her around and talked to her, and told her that I had been over to a neighborhood pond and had swam across the pond on the dog's back.  She accepted it and didn't make fun of it, but she told my mother and they laughed and teased me about it forever.  People don't realize the effect that chance encounters have.</p>
<p>
<pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Did your parents read to you at night?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  No, I don't remember the pleasures of that because, you see, when my mother taught—when she came home, there were lots of other things to be done.  I remember singing with them, and hearing them play the piano.  They did not need to read to me; I was always busy reading myself.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Can you remember when you learned to read?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  It would have been under Miss Fusesmith's tutelage in the first grade at the Lee School.  She was under great pressure because my mother felt that I was blighted because I was left-handed and dear Miss Fusesmith tried to change me.  It's a wonder she didn't make me stutter as a result of it.  But it didn't work.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Did that upset you when she tried to make you write with your right hand?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  I don't have any residual memory of an upset from it, but I know it didn't take and they finally gave up.  I really think I'm lucky.  I finally copied my grandfather's style of calligraphy.  He used to carry his pen between his index and middle finger when he wrote and I found that I could do that and provide a symmetrical handwriting.  But, of course, it was all slanted to the back.  Those penmanship teachers just gave up in distress because there was no way that I could do the Palmer method.  Remember that?  Oh, you're too young to remember that.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Oh, no, I remember the Palmer method and those eternal circles that we had to do.  I hated it.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Think of all the human energy that's been wasted throughout history because of those.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  And it's an uninteresting looking hand, anyway.  Well, you had very happy memories, then, with your parents.  You said you had to wear glasses when you were just—</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Two.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  —two years old.  Did that inhibit your reading?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  No.</p>
<p>
<pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  They didn't say, “You can't read much”?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Oh, no.  For a while I had to wear a frosted glass on one eye.  The strong eye was covered and the weak eye was made then to work.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  I see.  Was this a problem of being nearsighted?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Farsighted.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Oh, of being farsighted.  In a little child that is unusual, isn't it?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Well, I really don't know whether it's unusual or not, but I didn't feel blighted or abused from it.  I just put on glasses and went on about my business.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  And that did one frosted glass work?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Yes.  It helped, uh-huh.  It helped; it straightened the eye.  Nowadays they probably would have operated on an eye that was trying to cross.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Well, yours are certainly perfectly straight.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  I'm glad to know; I haven't looked.  But I didn't let it limit myself in anything, except playing basketball.  They wouldn't let me play basketball, but that was the only limitation that was ever—</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  And you wanted to play basketball?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Yes.  I thought it would have been great fun.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  You weren't very tall to play basketball.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Well, I knew I could have carried water.</p>
<p>
<pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Or been the mascot, the way your brother was.  By the way, we haven't ascertained your brothers' names.  What were their names?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  He was Reuben Elmer Lucas.  No, I'm sorry, Allan.  Reuben Allan.  Reuben Elmer was my father's name.  They were both named for my grandfathers.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Yes, you had told me that.  What was your other brother's name?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  William Chilton Lucas.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Reuben being the elder?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  That's right.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  We have that now.  What about religious training?  Did you go to Sunday School as a little girl?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Yes, very much.  I think I started in the cradle roll at the First Baptist Church in Columbia, Missouri, and I was baptized in that church by Luther Wesley Smith who was the Minister at that time.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  At what age were you baptized?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  I think I was about 12.  There was a good support for growing up in that kind of a relationship.  Remember they used to have what they called the BYPU [Baptist Young People's Union]?  When I got to college, we were so fortunate there, at the University of Missouri, because the Rockefeller Foundation had provided support at Stephens College for a Burrell class, it was called.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  A what?</hi>
</p>
<pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
<p>GINN:  Burrell, named for Jesse Burrell, later Eubank.  It was a Sunday School class for college students.  Just shortly after I started into college and there at the class, Ms. Burrell left and Nelly Lee Holt, later Mrs. Curtis Bok, was the teacher.  I was active in the Burrell class.  Stanley also, after I met him, was active in the Burrell Sunday School class.  He was president of the class.  I was president of the Women's Division.  It was a non-denominational Sunday School class.  Many mornings, there would be 500 or 600 students.  It was a real resource for encouragement and help.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  How often did they meet?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Every Sunday morning.  We would, on Sunday nights, many times drive to the intermediate prison over by Jefferson City, where the juveniles were kept, and have a Sunday evening Sunday School class.  The officers of the class would go and provide that kind of help.  We traveled to Marshall, Missouri, a state institution for young girls, and [did] the same kind of thing.  I know it was a real force for training and help and I've always been very grateful for it.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Yes, it also made you aware of the condition of the people in the prisons, and gave them a little interaction with youngsters who hadn't had problems.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Right, and it was good.  Oh, we had all kinds of projects.  I remember one time, when we were getting ready to entertain the Council of Burrell Class.  Nellie Lee and I made spaghetti for 60 people.  It was a good experience for me.  I don't know that that support is carried on.  In fact, I know it is no longer carried on, but it was some of the best money the Rockefellers ever spent.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Were your girls able to have any sort of training like that?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Not the equal Now, our older daughter, Nancy, is a graduate of Stephens College, and the kind of religious program that they had during her period was an evening prayer, it was called a Sunday evening prayer.  I remember she edited the book that they put out, that had in it some of the talks that were given during that time.  So there was a continuation of the philosophy of providing encouragement for students in which she partook.  Saarinen designed a beautiful little chapel on that campus and that was where the services were held.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Was Stephens founded the way, say, Northfield, was by a religious man?</hi>
</p>
<pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
<p>GINN:  Well, yes.  You have to say it was religious-related; it wasn't denominated.  It really has made a great contribution to the education of women.  My daughter, Nancy, has spoken about the value of going for at least a part of your education to a solely-female educational institution.  There is no competition between the sexes for positions of leadership, and you can have women who are the presidents and not just the secretaries of organizations.  In the development of the ability of women to assume positions of leadership, that worked very well for her.  She majored in Greek; had a marvelous professor there, Cynthia Dehler.  They had some wonderful members on that faculty.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  This is an interesting point—the all-girls or all-boys education.  What benefits does your daughter see to the male to go to an all-male school?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  I think it is probably identification as to what they are.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  I see.  And also, I suppose the opportunity to concentrate without distraction.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Yes.  There's no pretty ankles to take their mind off calculus.  The boys in our family all went to the Kemper Military School, which is an old military school in Boonville, Missouri.  I was on their Board of Trustees at one time.  I always laughed about that because I always wanted to go to Kemper and couldn't, so I said, “I got to be on their Board of Trustees instead.” I have great respect for it.  It's a good school.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Indeed it is.  Well, this liking for boys' things; you wouldn't classify yourself as having been a tomboy, would you?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Oh, I always wanted to do everything.  And whenever I wanted to do something that ordinarily was not the usual prerogative of a little girl in lace ruffles, I guess you'd have to call me a tomboy, because I would fish, I would pound and hammer.  I insisted on taking manual training when I was in the third grade.  And they all fell into a swoon because I wouldn't take home economics; but they let me do it, left-handed and all.  I went to the experimental school of the university which gave me the freedom.  And that, too, was a wonderful opportunity and institution, because there you didn't have a desk; you weren't limited as to your place.  You had your own chair—wonderful, old, straight-back, rush-bottom chairs—and you carried your own chair wherever you were in the school building.  The walls of every room in the school were lined with books and you didn't study mathematics; you played bean bags and added up the score.  You took French from the time you were in the third grade.  You had home economics, unless you could talk them into manual training, which was what I did.  That was probably as important an opportunity for diversity as I could have had at that time and place.</p>
<p>
<pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  How many years did you go to this experimental school?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Oh, until my mother found out I didn't know anything about mathematics, in the sixth grade.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  You mean, you didn't know your times tables?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  I really didn't.  And those fractions were just Greek.  However, she had the foresight to find me a wonderful, good friend as a tutor, and in six weeks she taught me all the mathematics I should have learned in the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, and 6th grades.  So I didn't lose any time.  She should be recorded for posterity.  She was Mrs. Caroline Crane, and she had a daughter, Charlotte Crane, who was one of our very good group.  Charlotte Crane married Mr. Stilwell and lived in Ithaca, New York, and she was a trustee of Cornell University, among other things.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  You have a fantastic memory for names.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Well, I've loved these people.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Yes, but it's amazing the way you recall the name of your kindergarten teacher.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  She must have made a considerable impact.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  She certainly must have.  Before we continue on with your education which, of course, is a very important part of your growing up, what about your grandparents, aunts and uncles?  Did you see much of them as a child?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Yes, yes.  We lived next door to my father's brother and his family for a long time.  Uncle Boyd Lucas [and] Aunt Frost Lucas had two sons.  They had a little baby girl who died when she was only a year old and then they had the two sons.  So there was an interchange all of the time.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Were the boys anywhere around your age?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  No, they were all younger than I.  I was the oldest grandchild.</p>
<p>
<pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  That must have made you special.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  It did; it did.  All of the boys were younger than I and so it did give me a special position.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  It must have, and especially with your aunt and uncle, who had lost a little girl.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Right.  You asked about the relationship with my grandparents.  Oh, I loved them; I loved to go and visit them.  They lived in Nevada, Missouri.  In Missouri, it is N�vada.  They lived in this wonderful, big old Victorian house that even had a tower room—old trunks in it, full of ancient Valentines and Easter cards, and kinds of windows on all four sides, and the funniest little steep flight of stairs to get up there.  And every summer I'd get to go and visit my grandmother.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Now, was this your mother's mother?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  My father's mother.  My mother's mother died when she was about seven.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  So you never knew the maternal grandmother.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  That's right.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Or grandfather?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Yes, oh, yes.  My mother's father used to come and spend months with us.  Wonderful man—tall, slender.  Bewick—Stephenson Chilton Bewick.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  What a wonderful name!  Stephenson Chilton Bewick—that's Chilton?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Yes.  Back to the grandparents Lucas, the Lucas side of it:  My grandmother had certain fixed ideas about how ladies should speak and how ladies should not speak.  And one time I ran away across the street to play with the Gamble children.  She told me not to cross the street, and I had done it.  So when she brought me home, she was remonstrating with me over my disobedience and I said a terrible, four-letter word—D-A-M-N.  She washed my mouth out with soap; made me sit in the rocking chair in the East parlor for an hour.  And to this day, my epithets are very limited.</p>
<p>
<pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  She certainly had an important role in your life!</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Oh, she really did.  She could make the most fabulous cookies.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Did you do any cooking with her, or with your Aunt Tiny?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  No, I really didn't; I really didn't.  I probably would have been more of a nuisance in the kitchen.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Oh, I'm sure you wouldn't.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  I can remember sitting at the round table in my grandmother's kitchen and eating the cookies as they came right out of the oven.  She barely could get the sugar sprinkled on them.  But I don't ever remember—oh, and setting the table; I always got to set the table to help.  But with Aunt Tiny, no—nobody ever bothered her kitchen.  That was her kingdom.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Did you spend family holidays at your grandparents'?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Yes.  I remember one winter, back when you still rode trains, that my Uncle Boyd and Aunt Frost and their two sons, and my mother and father, and then just my older brother, because that was before brother William was about.  We all took the train together and rode from Columbia, Missouri, all the way to Nevada, Missouri, for Christmas.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Oh, that must have been wonderful.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  It was; it was.  Oh, it was a wonderful time and a wonderful experience.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Indeed, it sounds quintessentially American, doesn't it?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  There's something that I should tell you about that house where my grandparents lived.  I have one aunt who is still living; she's in her late eighties.  About ten years ago she eloped and married a man 14 years her junior.  They live part of the time down on Lake Tablerock and part of the time in Nevada, so my grandmother's house is still intact; it's shut up, but the whole thing is there just as it has been for the last hundred years.</p>
<p>
<pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Wonderful!  She spends part of her time there still?  She had not been married previously?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Yes, she had been married once and her husband died, and she was a widow for a long time and then eloped with this man.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  I love it; eloping at that age.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  I tried to telephone her.  I couldn't find her anywhere.  I was scared to death, so I called the police.  If you don't think I encountered a mad woman.  The police started making inquiries as to where she was, and here she was off on her own honeymoon.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  You'd think at that age she wouldn't have to resort to eloping.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Well, I never did quite understand it.  Q:  More romantic that way, I suspect.</p>
<p>GINN:  Maybe that's it.  Now there's another point that I think was important to me in my relationship with my grandmother, and that was her devotion to the Episcopal church.  She was one of the founders of the Ladies' Aid Society.  She helped in the writing of the first cookbook that they put together, and I can remember reading that cookbook.  It said, in the first part of it, that it was written for the average family of ten children.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Oh, isn't that wonderful.  The average family of ten children.  What would the date of printing of that be?  Can you recall when?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Oh, it would have been about—between 1890 and 1900, I would think, and I bet you there's still a copy of it in that kitchen down there.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Probably there is, sure.  That's a wonderful story.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  She was Carrie Wilson.  And part of her family was Harry Leon Wilson, the author.  Her father had been a newspaper editor.  The earliest roots I can find of that family is in New York State, close to Johnstown.  And the earliest one was Watts Wilson.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Really?  And when was that?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  That would have been back before the Revolution.</p>
<p>
<pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  You have traced this back to Johnstown, New York; isn't that interesting.  So she was an Episcopalian and a founder of the Ladies' Aid Society.  You see, you get these genes from both sides.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  I hadn't realized it until I just verbalized this.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Is that so?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Here was a person willing to give of themselves when they saw something that was needed.  Oh, they had a swing on their front porch—a wonderful squeak—.  And my bedroom was just above the front porch.  Everybody who went to town had to pass their house, and they would sit on the front porch, and that old swing would squeak, squeak.  They always came to my grandmother and grandfather when they needed to talk out a problem, and the counseling they did on that front porch in the evenings I can still remember.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  It's really a very American story.  If I remember correctly, your father's people came from Culpeper.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  That's right.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  And married a woman whose antecedents came from New York.  And then another family got together and we have Rosemary.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  That's right.  Surprise!</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Surprise, yes.  Well, these are very strongly marked examples you had to follow, certainly.  When you were little, did your [parents indicate you were to go to college?]</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Oh yes, there was no question about that.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  It just was a given.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Oh, yes, absolutely.  When I was nine, I decided I wanted to be a juvenile judge.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Whatever put that idea into your head?</hi>
</p>
<pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
<p>GINN:  I have no idea.  But I had decided that that was it.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  At age nine?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Uh-hmm.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  I'm surprised you even knew what the words meant.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Well, we had some excellent neighbors there.  They had a big jar in which they always kept peanuts, and I would go over and sit and visit.  There was a maiden lady in the family and one of the members of that family was a Federal judge, so the recognition of the position of a judgeship I learned about very early.  And I liked the associations.  I assume this was my thinking, I liked the associations.  I think that's probably where it came from.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  You seem to have had a great awareness of what was going on around you.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Yes, I liked to listen.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  And so from that time on, did you actually work toward this goal?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Yes, absolutely.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  And that's why you went to law school.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Uh-hmm.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Well, following along, can you remember what your early books were?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Yes.  There's one; it was called The Rose Book of Romance.  It was a collection of fairy tales—Grimm's.  I still have the book.  And, of course, Kipling's Jungle Book, thanks to Dr. Hibbard, was one that I read and reread and have read to my children.  It's been a wonderful continuing.  I guess last year, year before last, when I got to Bombay, I had a sense of coming back home.</p>
<p>
<pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  A feeling of deja vu?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Yes.  I don't know how I could have been as lucky as I have been throughout my entire life.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  You had some very splendid influences.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Yes, there was another one—a Sunday School teacher, Miss Frances Denny, a beautiful, snow white, naturally curly haired maiden lady of uncertain vintage.  She was gentling influence.  I was always very grateful for her friendship; it was more than a teacher-student relationship.  We were good friends.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Our lives seem to have had a great many unmarried maidens with white hair who were interested in children.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Yes, and who shared themselves.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  They don't exist any more, I suppose.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Well, I'm not sure.  Now let me think if my daughters have some.  I'm sure they do; I'll have to ask Nancy.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  I would be interested.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  I think they will.  I think it is the ease of association with an individual who is of a different generation than your own that makes that possible.  And if you have access.  Now, one of Nancy's would be her Greek teacher, Cynthia Ohler.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Were you a voracious reader once you got the knack?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Oh, yes.  And I was so fortunate because our family made a move from the first neighborhood that we lived in.  My father bought a piece of property that was immediately in the center of the university that he expected to use to build his book business on eventually.  We lived in one of the houses that was on that for several years.  And, of course, with your mother away teaching music school you have time, We lived close enough to the school [and] you walked to school.  You came home for an hour-and-a-half lunch everyday.  Nobody had invented the school lunch program yet.  And I had stack privileges at the University of Missouri Library.</p>
<pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Reading unlimited.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Yes.  And I had my own little carrel, up on about the third floor back, and I could just go there and read any book that I wanted to, and I did.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Isn't that marvelous.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  And it really was.  As I say, I just don't know how lucky that I was to have had that.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Did any other books make such a particular impression on you that all this time later you can remember them?  Or a series of books, maybe?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  I think the joy of reading that I remember with the greatest pleasure was the Sunday New York Times on the floor of my mother and father's living room.  Of course, in Missouri it came the following Tuesday.  So I read the Sunday New York Times on Tuesday after its publication.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Was this because you were interested in the world events?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Oh, yes, just whatever.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Omnivorous curiosity.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  That's the word:  omnivorous curiosity.  That is true.  I would have to say it is a strong characteristic because I do have curiosity in whatever.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Well, that's a sign of intelligence, you know.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Oh, is that what it is?</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  There never was a bright child yet who wasn't insatiably curious.  Did you collect stamps or play with dolls?  What sort of hobbies did you have?</hi>
</p>
<pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
<p>GINN:  I can remember making doll clothes for little tiny—there was a time when you could buy a celluloid doll.  You're too young to know about celluloid dolls.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  With the bathtub?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Oh, yes.  And paper dolls; I enjoyed paper dolls.  Grace G. Drayton's drawings in the Pictorial Review.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  I'm not familiar with hers.  In the Pictorial Review?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Yes, beautiful drawings that she made.  Oh, I treasured those, and I would visit my friends and we would cut out paper dolls and collect them.  I guess I did collect paper dolls like that.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Did you play jacks?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Yes, I did.  I played jacks.  Played marbles on the living room rug, too.  It had a great Persian design; it was just right to play marbles on.  Oh, piano lessons, of course; dancing lessons.  Oh, I loved dancing lessons.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  That would be ballroom?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Noooo.  Toe dancing.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Oh, ballet.  What about jump rope, hopscotch?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Yes.  One of the activities that I engaged in in high school was debating.  That was the beginning of any kind of speech training that I had.  That was when I experienced my first and only real case of stage fright.  It was during a debate, a high school debate, and I absolutely froze and went totally blank in the middle of the speech.  And so I've always been very sympathetic with anybody in the beginning of the experience of public address.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  How did you get through the occasion?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Well, I just cleared my throat several times and looked and found my notes, and went on and ignored what had happened.</p>
<pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  And nobody ever knew?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Nobody ever knew.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  But it is a terrible experience.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  It is; it really is a terrifying experience.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  And you've never had it since?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  No, because I always cover the possibility.  There's always some kind of cues in front of me.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  You don't ever try to ad lib it totally?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Oh, sure; oh, sure.  There's many speeches that I make, but there's nearly always something, so that I don't forget the points that I want to make.  I've had that experience and I know what it's like, and I know it can be controlled and lived through, so it isn't terrifying for me like it is for some people.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  You've learned to control it.  It can be completely devastating.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Yes, it can.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  I understand Sir Laurence Olivier was practically crippled by it because he had spells where it happened every time he went out on the stage.  Eventually, he overcame it, with help, of course.  But it must be awful when you earn your living that way.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Oh my!</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Well, after the sixth grade, when your mother discovered that you weren't getting all you might be out of the University schooling, what happened then?</hi>
</p>
<pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
<p>GINN:  Then she transferred me to the public schools, and the woman who had been my kind mathematics coach happened to be my mathematics teacher for that first year, so she knew what problems I was laboring under and she was very patient with me, and helpful.  So I even came through all of the mathematics that I should have had and had no problems.  Of course, the other subjects were all very easy and adequate.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Were your parents firm believers in public schooling?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  No, I don't think so, because, you see, the first grade school was the experimental school of the University, which was not a public school.  My brothers were all sent to a private military school.  I don't ever remember any kind of discussion as to the merits and demerits on that basis.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Did you do all of your high school in the public school?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Yes, David Henry Hickman High School, Class of '29.  We had our 57th Reunion this year.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Did you really?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  And Jean Hibbard Stephens came back for it.  She should have credit for the fact that one of the members of our class, whom I shall leave nameless, had agreed to come and be our speaker.  The day of the reunion, we received a telegram, of all things, saying that he couldn't come and wished us a fine time.  And there we were with no speaker.  And so Jeanne and her husband, Dr. James Stephens, said they would pinch-hit, and they told of their experiences living as doctors in their volunteer service in Africa.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Did they?  That must have been a fascinating talk.  That was kind of them to do that.  When you were in high school, did you get to choose the courses that you wanted to take?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Oh, there was a basic number of courses that were required for graduation.  Mine was the usual course.  The only real deviation was that I insisted that I be permitted to take physics, And I was the only girl in the class.  So, on the first day, they sent me outside while the professor lectured the boys as to how to behave when there was a woman in the physics class.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Really!  May I ask what possessed you to want to take physics?</hi>
</p>
<pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
<p>GINN:  I have no idea why, but I was going to take physics, by golly, or else [laughter].  Probably the same kind of thinking that made me want to take manual training in the third grade.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Yes, if it were for only boys, you were going to get in and see what was going on in there.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Yes, yes.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  You seem to have had great success in getting your own way.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Well, yes.  There's ways to ask for things and there's ways that .  .  .  Soft words never hurt.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  And I presume your parents went along?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  They supported me totally.  Whatever I wanted to do they thought I should be given a chance to try.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  It's wonderful, isn't it?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Oh, my!  It makes such a difference, yes.  There was no need to ever develop any strength, energy, or bitterness about having to revolt against anything that they want, because whatever I wanted to do they thought was just right.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  The ideal circumstance, of course.  Now while you were in high school, you debated.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Yes.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Did you also write for the school paper?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Oh, yes.  I was editor of the annual the year I was a senior; it was called The Cresset.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  What does that mean?</hi>
</p>
<pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
<p>GINN:  I have no idea what it means.  It's just what it was called.  As a matter of fact, it never occurred to me to figure it out; I should have done that.  Good idea.  Next time I'm in high school, I'll remember that.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Yes, you ask them why is it called this?  That's curious.  Maybe somebody named Cresset put up the money for the first one.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  That's a wonderful question.  I can hardly wait to get back home; I'll have to run that down.  Because I'll be you nobody else knows.  But that was probably the first responsible position of leadership where I had to encourage other people to work with me on a volunteer basis.  It was a good experience and some of the people who were on that staff with me are still my good friends.  They came back to this 50-somethingth reunion, and the woman who was the art editor came back and did the designs for the banquet that we had.  She and her husband have worked in India.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  There is a tremendous continuity in your life [story].  It goes back pre-Revolution, all the way through.  It's really the ultimate American story, isn't it?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  It is; it is.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Were you elected to this position, or did the English teachers appoint you, or how did this come about?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  It was both.  The publisher, who was in Kansas City, I think it was Burger Publishing Company in Kansas City, provided a course of training for student editors.  And gave you a booklet to study, and that sort of thing.  Then you had to write a paper, and so forth, and then, I think, the teachers had input into it.  It was on that basis.  It was not an elected position.  I enjoyed it.  I think that someday when I grow up again, I might want to be an editor.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Next time around.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Next time around.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Yes.  If you can't do everything the first time .  .  .</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  I'm beginning to find that out.  There are so many things that it would be fun to do.</p>
<p>
<pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Well, I don't think too many have gotten by you, so far.  What were your favorite subjects?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  I majored in sociology when I got to college, and minored in philosophy.  I guess, kind of the human relationships would have to be the generic term for the subjects that interested me most.  I made good enough grades in high school.  Remember the old National Honor Society?  Well, I was elected to that in the first round.  I think I was sixth or seventh in my class.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Had you been a top student all the way through?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  I'd been a good student.  Yes, I'd been a good student.  It was important to me to be a good student.  All my friends were good students.  Jean Hibbard was always smarter than I; she made better grades than I did.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  How many were there in your high school class?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Oh, more than 200.  Seems to me like it was around 225 or 250 people.  But I couldn't play basketball.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  You never got to play basketball?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  No.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Did you play any team sports?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  I played baseball with my kid brothers.  But I guess I have to say that the glasses did limit my athletic participation.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Yes.  Because you seem to have had the inclination for it.  Could you play tennis, for example?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Oh, yes.  I played tennis.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  And swam, I suppose?</hi>
</p>
<pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
<p>GINN:  Yes.  One summer, my boy friends and I built a tennis court at the side of my mother and father's house; skimmed off all the grass and got the clay filled in and fixed it.  Oh, we just had great tennis games.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  That's a terrific project.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Oh, it was; a good project.  And then my mother and father gave us a large chicken house and we turned it into a recreation house, so, we could have all kinds of parties there.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Now, what age was this?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  That was 14, 15, and 16.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Your mid-teens were happy years?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Oh, very happy years.  And my friends were always welcome in our home.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Ah, that's important, isn't it?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Yes.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  I suppose you liked English a great deal, didn't you?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Yes, but I learned more grammar in my Latin classes than I ever learned in English.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  What languages did you take in high school?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Latin, and then when I got to college I had Spanish and I had German.  And French in one of the experimental classes in the elementary school, in grade school.  None of it really was a thorough grounding in the language but it gave me an ear for the language, and a feeling that it wouldn't be a hard problem to study any other language.  I think that overcame any fear that I might have had.  And, of course, looking back, I wish that I had taken many more languages.  I would love to know Chinese.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Uh-hmm, but Chinese wasn't offered, I'm sure.  Besides, you couldn't have taken physics.</hi>
</p>
<pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
<p>GINN:  That's right.  [Laughter]</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  How about your high school teachers?  We've already mentioned this math teacher.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Mrs. Crane, yes, Mrs. Crane.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  What about other ones?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Oh, let's see.  There was one of the women who was not a teacher, but she was an administrator in the office of the principal; Miss Acena Boothe.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  My goodness!  You even remember her name.  How do you spell that first name?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  I think it's A-C-E-N-A.  She was a maiden lady of uncertain vintage, straight back, still wore net collars around her throat and was the proper Southern lady of a distinguished background.  The advice which she gave me I have never forgotten.  She said, “Miss Rosemary, you must never let your books interfere with your education.”</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Very clever!</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Lovely lady; lovely lady.  But aside from Mrs. Crane, I don't remember having a specific affinity for my high school teachers—not nearly the kind of admiration that I felt for some of my professors in the university.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Did you have in high school a regular course in physical education?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Yes.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Did you hate it?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  No, no, no.  Won my State letter for proficiency in certain gymnastics and exercises; that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  So you went on to college.  Now, how did you decide where to go?</hi>
</p>
<pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
<p>GINN:  There was no question.  I was right there at home.  I would stay right there.  My mother had been a Tri-Delta at the University of Wisconsin, and I thought there was only one thing for a young lady to do and that was to do just as her mother had done, and I was proud to be asked to be a member of Delta Delta Delta.  I was a member there on the campus.  Oh, there were times when I would think about maybe going to a different college, but just some place off in the dream world.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Did you live at the sorority house?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  One year.  But I had my own car, and so I could zip back and forth to the university for classes.  Transportation was no problem.  And I enjoyed living at home.  In fact, when I did go and live in the sorority house, I took my own furniture with me.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  I have not asked you if in high school you held office.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Other than the debating, the membership in the club of those who had the State athletic letters, I don't ever remember being a class officer.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  I suppose mostly boys were officers, but usually a girl was the secretary, wasn't she?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Yes, the prettiest girl was elected secretary of the class.  I was chosen by the faculty as the most versatile girl in our class.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Well, that's quite an honor.  At what age did you begin to date boys?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Oh, let's see.  I guess when I was about 14 or 15.  One of my two very best friends and I double-dated, and we went to a Sunday School picnic.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  That was your first date?  Pretty exciting, wasn't it?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Just very exciting.  Oh, my goodness gracious!  It was; it really was.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  It's so innocent.  A Sunday School picnic!  I suppose you went to movies and the school parties and dances?</hi>
</p>
<pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
<p>GINN:  Saturday afternoon all of our group of friends—the seven or eight, all girl types—would go to the matinee; that was your Saturday afternoon expectation.  Then thereafter you went to the drugstore and had a chocolate sundae and we walked.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Did you have a lot of school dances?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  No, there were not.  There were not lots of school dances.  There would be some parties, but the social program was not heavily emphasized.  Now, we would have little Victrola dances in our various homes.  There were eight or ten of us who would have a dance in our house and somebody would bring his victrola, portable victrolas in those black leather cases.  I once took one up the river in a rowboat because we had a house party.  That was the beginning of the availability of music for the young.  Just think what has happened now.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Brings back memories, doesn't it?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  It certainly does.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Well now, in college you must have dated.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Oh, yes.  When I was a senior in high school, I did go with one boy pretty regularly—nice young fella, just a nice young fella, and he was very kind to me and good to me.  He was a wonderful security blanket.  I always knew that there would be somebody who would want to take me someplace.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Do you know what happened to him?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Yes, I do.  He's now dead, but he went on to graduate from engineering school at the university.  I respected him; I still do.  He was not for me, but he was good to me.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  But it's good practice, going out with boys, So that when you find the right one you know it.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  That's right.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  In college, did you have a particular boy friend?  Or did you just date?</hi>
</p>
<pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
<p>GINN:  Well, I dated this boy that I dated in high school for, oh, maybe the first couple of years.  I didn't date many other people.  I was busy.  A heavy social calendar just wasn't my cup of tea.  I had companionship when I wanted it and that was fine, and then when I got to law school, the spring before I went into law school, why one of the legal fraternities invited three of us women who were going into law school to Sunday dinner.  Danforth Josslyn, who was a relative of my mother and father's, wonderful, close friends, invited me to go to his fraternity, and he introduced me to this real tall, skinny Ozarker whose name was Stanley Ginn.  I enjoyed the dinner at the fraternity house very much; thought nothing further about it until the following fall.  One day I was going up to the library and he was coming downstairs and he said, “Hello!  How are you?” And we visited a little bit.  And he said, “Come, go with me.” And I said, “Where are you going?' He said, “I'm going to buy some chewing tobacco so I can stay awake in finals.” I didn't believe him so I went along to see.  I'm still going along to see.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Yes, you're still going along!</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  And then he walked me home to the sorority house.  Well, we both dated other people and had many other friends.  He tutored me in some of my law subjects.  And I know it was because of his tutoring that I made an A in criminal law.  We were just good friends then.  By the end of that first year, why we spent some time together.  He took me down to visit his mother and father.  When he did, why he had extolled the virtues of his family home and described the beautiful pear orchard.  We had a great joke about the jonquil flower.  We went for Easter to visit his parents for the first time, and I said, “Oh, those are such lovely jonquils.” He said, “Those aren't jonquils, those are Easter lilies.” I said, “I know better.  There's no such thing.  That is a jonquil.” Well, yes-no, yes-no, for 50 miles.  He said, “We'll ask anybody in Miller when we get there what those are,” and so we did.  Of course, in Miller, everybody called them Easter lilies, so I lost that bet.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  He had that rigged.  Now where is Miller?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  In southwest Missouri.  It's a little tiny town; it's an old town, though.  It's between Springfield, Missouri and Joplin, Missouri.  His father was a country lawyer.  When we pulled into Miller, instead of taking me to his parents' home, he took me over in another part of the town and pulled up in front of the worst old, broken down cabin that had one stalk of a pear tree in the front yard and said, “Well, here we are.” Well, I tell you', I didn't know whether I'd gotten off the wrong train or not, and he said, “Well, go ahead, get out.” Well, I just put my hand on the handle and opened the door, but, oh, you just can't imagine what thoughts went through my mind.  Then he laughed and he said, “Oh, come on.  I'm teasing.” And we went on over to his home.  His mother was so mad at him.  She was so mad at him, I'm surprised she just didn't paddle him good.</p>
<p>
<pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  How did you take it?  Were you mad?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  No, I wasn't mad.  [Laughing] It's still funny.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  You knew him by that time.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  By then, I knew him; I was on guard.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Yes, I can see that.  Well, you majored in sociology and minored in philosophy, did you have to take any pre-law courses?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Those were then considered as adequate preparation.  Of course, there was a usual requirement.  The first degree was your Bachelor of Arts and you had an option; you could take three years of arts and sciences and then go into law school, which let you finish the three years in each and still have the two degrees.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  I see, so you'd end up with six years instead of seven.  And you opted for that?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  That's right.  Of course, you have quite a time.  I don't think it could be done now because the requirements for a Bachelor of Arts have been extended and I don't think you could fit it all in in three years, but then I could.  I was a good student.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  But you had to apply yourself to do everything.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  That's right.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  And, of course, especially with the philosophy part—a tremendous amount of reading.</hi>
</p>
<pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
<p>GINN:  Yes, but I enjoyed it.  I enjoyed it all.  The man who was the head of the sociology department, Dr. Arthur Emig—I found a comfortable relationship.  He was the kind of a professor that made you want to study, made you want to do your best, and you were pleased to give it everything that you could.  He was an excellent professor.  His wife was the secretary of the YWCA on the campus, Constance Emig.  She was Constance Latshaw Emig.  She was from Kansas City.  They were a great source of strength for the students on that campus.  During that same time, there was a psychology professor whose name will come up shortly.  He was an excellent teacher.  I can't pull it up now, but I will, because I want him remembered.  He was great.  He stayed on that campus for his entire academic career.  It seems to me like he had his Ph.D. from the University of Chicago.  McKinney.  Dr. Frank McKinney.  I remember that in the opening part of that class, he was discussing fortune tellers.  I volunteered that there was a fortune teller in Columbia, Missouri, so he said, “Well, let's go find out about it.” So, he and I went to the fortune teller together.  It was a great experience and lots of fun.  Of course, we did not tell the lady who we were, what we were, and why we were doing it, but then he went back to class and went through all of the things that she had told me and pointed out their generalizations, and how many broad fields that they could cover.  It was really very good analysis of what we had done.  I enjoyed my classes in psychology very much; they were good.  I tutored one boy in anthropology.  He was a football player and he needed some help.  Of course, again, that was within the department of sociology at that point in time.  I don't remember being a very successful teacher, but I did tell Dr. Emig that at least the boy now knew the name of the course.  [Laughter]</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  That's a plus.  Well, in the university did you work at all outside?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  In the summer I edited school supply catalogues for my father.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  That must have been painstaking work.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  It was, but I enjoyed it.  I did that for two or three summers.  And then one summer I traveled with my fried, Dorothy Nell, in my Model A Ford, selling school books over the state of Missouri.  My father had a little publishing company in addition to his book business.  I traveled and called on the county superintendents of schools for county adoption; at that time, textbooks were adopted by the county.  That was awfully good experience, when you're seventeen and a half, or something like that.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  That certainly showed a lot of confidence in you that your father would send you out.</hi>
</p>
<pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
<p>GINN:  He encouraged me.  He gave me all kinds of avenues of experience.  My mother and father sent me to Germany the summer between my freshman and sophomore year.  I went with my best friend, Dorothy Nell, and her mother.  Her mother taught German at Stephens College.  We lived in Heidelberg for the summer.  Back then, you could have a rucksack and you walked through the Black Forest and the traveling American student was much in evidence.  It was a wonderful summer; it couldn't have come at a better time.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  What year would that have been?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  That was in 1930.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Pre-Hitler, really.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Oh, in fact, when we were in Oberammergau, why we bought some of the lederhosen and the funny little hats with the feather, the socks that had no feet and the suspenders with embroidery across the front.  We just thought we were the real kittens, but we figured we'd better inquire, so we went to the grandmother of the house where we were staying, who was sitting by the fireplace that was almost as tall as these doors are here, and asked her if she thought it would be all right for us to go downtown.  She said she thought it would be all right, and so downtown we went, and we climbed a small Alp so we could say that we had done that.  And pretty soon, here came the storm troopers.  They told us to go home, to take those clothes off, that we were corrupting the morals of the community.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  This was in 1930?  I didn't realize that they had pervaded Germany to that extent back then.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Of course, the maddest person in the whole outfit was the grandmother.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Were you frightened?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Well, yes.  We were a little frightened; we were a little concerned.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Was this because you were girls wearing these outfits?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  I guess so, because all the men in the community wore them then.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  But they didn't know you weren't German until they spoke to you.  I mean they wouldn't know—</hi>
</p>
<pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
<p>GINN:  They probably could have.  Then I was wearing octagonally-sided glasses, and that would have identified us.  And, of course, walking down the street, we were not speaking German, we were speaking English.  But in 1930, that trip—we went by ship.  We went over on the Holland American Line, the New Amsterdam.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  You must have had a wonderful time.  Quite an experience!  Tell me about your life in the sorority.  It has obviously meant a great deal to you through the years.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Yes, it was.  It was a good experience, because I never had any sisters, and I always wanted a sister, so I enjoyed that very much.  Not living in the house, you have a different sorority experience than if you do.  And the one semester that I did live [there I was the vice president].</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Did you spend a great deal of time at your sorority?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Not really in the sorority house.  In the years that I did not live in the sorority house, I was in so many activities on the campus, with the YWCA, with the government areas, with the debating that I did for the university, and the work that I did in Burrell class, the Sunday school, there was always some kind of a meeting that had to be attended, and so the sorority was not my major concern of extracurricular activity.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Was it affiliated with any male fraternity?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  No, no; it wasn't.  There wasn't that kind of interrelationship at that point, [not] nearly as strongly as I see it on the campuses now.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Oh, is it strong now?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  At least it is on the University of Missouri; they kind of have pairs, yes.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Did you have your meals there?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  No.  Only when I'd do over for chapter meeting on Monday night.  I can remember feeling that the meetings were long and tedious, and that's when I learned to do needlepoint.</p>
<p>
<pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Well, let's go back to your visit with Mr. Ginn.  What happened after that?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Well, we went on over to his house.  His mother, when she found out what he had done, was just furious; she was just furious.  It was a good visit; a good visit.  I was pleased to meet her and his father and I bet his father that Stanley would pass the bar examination.  He took the bar examination before he graduated from law school, when he was a junior in law school, and then he practiced law his senior year in law school.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Isn't that pretty unusual?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Very, very.  Couldn't do it now, but then you could.  That was interesting, to still be in law school and practice law.  He had taken the examination when we went to meet his mother and father and so I think I bet his father a nickel that he would pass the bar examination.  Of course, he was teasing me; interested that I would support the fact that I thought Stanley would pass.  And Stanley did; he did.  Then, in that summer, he went home and tutored his own brother, who wanted to be a lawyer, and made it possible for the very last time for anybody who had not been to the university to take the bar examination.  He worked and interceded on behalf of his brother.  The people in charge of the bar board said, yes, they'd give him one chance to take the bar examination.  He took it and passed; and was an exceptional lawyer and was a judge.  Stanley tutored him, taught him, would take his notes home from law school and teach his brother.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Was Stanley the oldest in the family?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  The youngest.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  He was the youngest?  This was his older brother?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Yes.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Isn't that something!</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Stanley had a sister who was 18 years older than he.  She was a very strong influence on him.  It was she who taught school and brought home books for Stanley, and whenever he would make a good grade, she'd bring him another book.  She encouraged him, a very strong influence.</p>
<p>
<pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  When were you married?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  In 19 and 34.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  And he had passed the bar exam.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  He had passed the bar, he had graduated from law school, he had filed for prosecuting attorney in his home county, and he said, “I need you to come and help me.” And so I did.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  How much more did you have to do?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  One year.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Really?  And you didn't regret it?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  No.  There were times, sometimes I wondered, but it never lasted long—it passes easily.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  You never had the desire to go back and pick up that one year?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Yes, yes, I did.  I've thought about it now, long since, just because it's an unfinished piece of business.  So I wrote to the university and got my transcript, and when I studied it, I figured, well, girl, you're just as well off where you are.  Just let it sit.  Because I didn't make nearly as good grades—nobody makes the same kind of grades in law school as they do in arts and science.  So, I haven't closed the door.  I might go back and try to take one course.  But think what that would do to my fall schedule.  [Laughter] No hunting, no travel, no QEII. [Queen Elizabeth II cruise ship]</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  No, you couldn't do it.  It would really louse up the cruises unless they let you do it by correspondence.  You could mail the lessons back each time you hit a port.</hi>
</p>
<p>So you moved to—</p>
<p>GINN:  We moved back down to his home county and we lived in Aurora, Missouri.  We lived there for six years.  The county seat was Mt. Vernon, and Stanley drove there.  He was elected, of course.</p>
<p>
<pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  You mean he filed for prosecuting attorney and then they voted?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  While he was still in school.  He had a stiff race in the primaries.  In 1934, if you'll remember, why Roosevelt did all kinds of things in traditionally Republican areas, but Stanley won.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Good for him!  Did you go out on the hustings, as they say?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  You better believe it, I did.  I went door-to-door.  One of the places that I went, why I fell through a hole in the porch floor of the house [where] I was going to knock on the door.  And another place I went, why, the man said, “Woman, go home.  Your place is in the kitchen.” Another place I went, a cat bit me.  I went to meetings, and that was when I started making political speeches.  Of course, I joined the Women's Republican Club there, and I made speeches, and that was the beginning of a long life of political speeches.  Apparently, people liked what they heard.  I remember a speech that I gave, and I have thought about this, at the high school in Aurora.  It was for a Mother's Day gathering.  The theme of the speech was that life can either be just plain stew, or it can be—and what is the French word for a mixture of spices.  [Bouquet garni] It's the addition of spices to food.  I can't pull up that word and haven't been able to, and haven't looked it up,  but there's a difference in whether you have spices in life, whether you make the most of whatever it is you're going to do, or whether it's just plain stew.  That was what I said to those young women, and that was how I have lived.  By golly, I'm going to put the most into it, I'm going to get the most out of it.  I really think that's what I have lived by.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Very, very good.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  I didn't realize that until two or three months ago when I was trying to figure myself out, but I think that has always been important to me.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  It must have been if you wrote that speech way back in those days.  That's a very mature outlook.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  That would have been in about 19 and 35 or 36.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  In effect, not what happens, but how you—</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  What you do with it; what you do with it.</p>
<pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  How soon did you have your first child?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Five years later.  We couldn't afford one till then.  That's right.  When Stanley was elected prosecuting attorney, his salary was $216.56 a month.  Rent was $15, pork chops were a nickel, a maid three days a week was $6 a week.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  He had $50 a week.  This was, of course, the '30s, the height of the Depression.  Six dollars a week for a maid!</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  That was all she would have received on relief, and she kept her dignity because she [was employed].</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Of course.  Did you enjoy those early years?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Oh, we had a wonderful time.  We had good neighbors.  At that time, there were about a half a dozen young couples, all of whom were college graduates, who all happened to move to that little town at the same time.  So we had our own bridge club, and we would gather every couple of weeks and everybody'd bring a dish and we'd have supper.  It's a very small town; I think there were about 4,000 people that lived there.  So it gave us our own community of people who had similar professional interests.  One was the banker, one of them ran the gas company, one sold Maytags, one owned the newspaper, and so they were people of comparable interests.  We had a wonderful time.  And, of course, we were all young.  It was an excellent time.  We enjoyed it there.  The girls started a bridge club.  The boys, of course, belonged to the Rotary Club.  It was the usual small-town pattern of middle America, very comfortable living.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  What is it they call the young men who are the leaders like that?  Junior Boosters, or something like that.  There is usually a club.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  There are many clubs.  There's a Metro Club.  Well, there are quite a few.  I taught a Sunday school class of ladies over 60.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Now where did you come up with that idea?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Well, they needed a teacher, and, of course, the women who were in that class knew so much more about the Bible than I ever did or will know, but we had a great time.  We'd have a social meeting once a month.  They enjoyed it and so did I.</p>
<pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Did you prepare the lessons for them?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Oh, yes, I did it.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Do you like to teach?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Yes, I enjoyed it.  I taught then and I taught at Girls' State many years later, which is one of the projects of the American Legion.  They do Boys' State and they do Girls' State.  All of our family has been involved in Girls' State.  Stanley taught law at Girls' State for years and years and years.  Nancy taught journalism at Girls' State and Sally taught there.  Then one semester they asked me to come back to Stephens College and teach politics as a guest professor, and I did that.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  This Girls' State, it that an actual school?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  No, it's a week's training in government.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Is that the one where they act as mayor, and governor, and—</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Yes, and then they have Girls' Nation.  Sally was sent as the representative from Missouri to Girls' Nation.  That has been the teaching experience, which has always been on the periphery of what I have done.  I enjoyed it.  I once taught the first grade in Princeton, New Jersey —the morning the teacher couldn't get there because of snow storm.  Nancy was in first grade.  Stanley was [at Princeton] in officer's training.  There was no teacher, so I said, “Well, I'll teach until the teacher comes.” That was funny because the kids knew that they could just do anything, because I had no levers of control over it.  Oh, it was quite a morning.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  I can imagine; utter chaos.  Well, now we're coming up to World War II.  Were you following what was going on in Europe all this time, as the situation was developing and getting nastier and nastier?</hi>
</p>
<pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
<p>GINN:  Yes, we were, because we knew if we were involved in war that Stanley would want to be involved.  And it was along about that time that the governor appointed him head of the state highway patrol.  He was the youngest man who has ever been that in Missouri.  So we moved to Jefferson City.  We lived there for two years and a half, and that was the time when the war was developing.  The secretary of state position became vacated and the governor wanted Stanley to be secretary of state.  Stanley said, “I'd better not because if the situation gets any worse, why I will join.” And the Governor said, “Well, you won't have to because I need you here.” Stanley said, “Yes, I know you do, but the other has to be done.” So he did, he resigned as head of the state police, and was given a commission in the Navy.  They put him in military government.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  That was sensible on their part.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  It was.  It was good judgment.  He took his basic training at Princeton, and then they kept him there for their military government school.  When we found he was to be there for that training, we packed up the family silver and the washing machine and the baby's crib and two trunks and moved to Princeton and lived in a filling station.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Lived in a filling station?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  That's all we could find to live in.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Really?  How old was your little girl?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  The baby was still in her crib, Sally.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Oh, you had two by this time?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Yes.  She was about a year old.  We shared it with a couple from Minnesota.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Must have been awful!  [Laughter]</hi>
</p>
<pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
<p>GINN:  We had a wonderful neighbor who stuttered.  I won't use her name because it isn't fair to her, but she tried so hard to help us.  Nancy was in the first grade.  That was how I got involved in the first grade at the first school.  Nancy decided she'd go home with another little girl and play after school.  Well, that was fine, but she got off at this other little girl's house and the bus driver didn't know any differently, and the mother of the child to whose home she went didn't have any idea who this child was.  Nancy had no idea about a telephone number or what.  Fortunately, the stuttering neighbor called up every one of her neigh-neigh-bors all up and down the li-li-line.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Bless her heart!</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  So that we could go get her.  But, oh, that was an exciting winter.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Were you beside yourself when she didn't get off the bus?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Yes.  But it was an interesting experience.  At that time, my brother Bill was going to have his—I guess it was—his 21st birthday along about that time.  It was when Albert Einstein was still living in Princeton.  So I went to the bookstore in Princeton and bought one of his books, and Nancy in a blue snowsuit and I went to his home.  His sister received us, gave Nancy a peppermint, and we talked.  I told his sister this was my young brother's birthday coming up and that he was a great admirer of Dr. Einstein and would there be any chance he would autograph this book for my brother?  Well, she said, “I don't know.  I don't think he would, but he might.  Just leave the book.” And I did, and he did.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  And he did.  How nice.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  It was a kindness that he did.  Now I don't think I'd have the nerve to go ask such a unique human to use his time and thoughts, but then—and, of course, it was very important to kid brother Bill.  By then, you see, my parents were both dead.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  And he was living with you?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Yes.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Not in the filling station, I hope.</hi>
</p>
<pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
<p>GINN:  No, he didn't go with us back there.  He was by then back in Kemper Military Academy.  But it was a great kindness that Einstein did.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Indeed.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  But life there in the filling station was—it didn't hurt us.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  What did you do for a kitchen?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Well, there was a little kitchen place, kind of in the back, where we had an old gas stove and some kind of a funny little ice box.  We used an orange crate for the coffee table, and we had our washing machine, which was a godsend.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Was that one of those Maytags that agitated back and forth, with the wringer?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Yes.  That was the kind.  From there it traveled with us to Monterey, California.  Stanley made some wonderful trips available.  He took the children over to the Asbury Park Amusement Park.  He took me to New York one weekend.  He took me to Washington for another weekend.  He tried to make it as comfortable and as fun as he could.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Well, this other family—did they have children, too?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Yes, they had one little girl, Noreen, and she was a little bit older than Sally.  She and Sally played together a great deal, but I remember that Noreen insisted on usurping Sally's doll.  Sally's kind of a quiet piece of dynamite.  She stood it as long as she could and she picked up a hammer and hit Noreen on the head.  Now I'll tell you, that strained the relationship inside that filling station.  [Laughter] But there was no permanent damage done.  It was fun.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  How long did this go on?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  We lived there for about six months.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Through the winter?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Yes.</p>
<p>
<pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  It must have been grim.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Highway #1, on the west side of the road.  [Laughs] The roof leaked.  We had pans all across what would have been the office of the filling station.  Then Stanley's orders sent him to Monterey, California where he was to be prepared for going overseas.  When we got out there, we couldn't find any housing in Monterey.  There were three men, one of whom was from St. Louis; one was from Texas, and Stanley.  One was in civilian life an educator, the second one was an engineer, and Ginn was the lawyer, so they made a good team.  They found a magnificent house out on the 17-mile drive that faces the Pacific Ocean, in Pebble Beach.  It belonged to a minister named Davidson, Dr. Davidson, in Los Angeles.  He and his wife had decided they would make their summer vacation house available to military.  Stanley talked him into renting it to the three families.  It took three families' combined housing allotment to be able to afford it.  It was a beautiful house, gorgeously furnished down to the last two dozen linen, monogrammed sheets.  Beautiful.  We lived there while the boys were being prepared to go overseas.  Stanley was the fisherman and he would go down and catch abalone.  Fortunately, there was a mint bed in the back patio and an orange tree, so we all survived.  We'd all go and stand in line with our meat coupons, sometimes as long as three hours to get chicken.  And then, let's see, I guess it was about another six months before Stanley was finally shipped overseas.  He was sent to the Philippines.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  What year was this?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Oh, it was 1944.  Then I came back to Missouri—Columbia—while he was overseas.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  I gather that during this one-year time period that we're talking about here, you were busy just coping, keeping body and soul together and watching the children and so forth.  You had no time to do any other war work.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  No, and I was not in a community where I had any kind of association or connection.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Did you feel terribly cut off when you were in the filling station?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  No, I think we just kind of laughed about it.  All through this time I was associated with National Mortar Board.  So that gave me a continuity of interest.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  In what way were you still associated?</hi>
</p>
<pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
<p>GINN:  Oh, I've forgotten.  In '46—I was National President for six years, and it was before then.  I guess I was director of expansion.  I did everything in Mortar Board.  I was associated with them nationally for 40 years.  I started right after I got out of college, even when I lived in Aurora, so there was a continuing, outside interest, even with little people and all that.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Now you made Mortar Board what, your junior year in college?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  You're elected at the end of your junior year.  I was vice president of the chapter [and] the president couldn't go to the national convention; so they sent me.  It was at Frenchlick, Indiana, and because it was in the geographical area that the University of Missouri was contained, our particular section was responsible for the banquet, and I was toastmaster.  I guess they liked what they heard and saw, because the next year they asked me to be a section director, which was the responsibility for the chapters.  Then I started visiting college campuses and universities, and then, for 40 years, I was just a part of it.  It was a very rewarding time.  There is now a Rosemary Ginn Fellowship in Mortar Board.  The young man who was awarded it this year—and now Mortar Board accepts men members as well as women—is a freshman in Stanford University Law School.</p>
<p>I have to think that the experience that I had with the wonderful women with whom I worked—they are my life-long friends—was probably the most enriching experience that anybody could have, to have the opportunity of continuing to work with seniors in universities and colleges, watch how they were developing and the changes and the opportunities that came about, and the women who continued to enter into professional schools.  It's when the transition for women really began.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  And you were able to do some of this, at least, throughout the war?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  All through the time.  I used to visit universities when they were applying for chapters.  I'll never forget the time that a university in Tennessee, Vanderbilt University, [was installed].  I went down to install the chapter, and, of course, you go as a great dignitary and all that stuff.  A little girl met me at the airport and took me to the hotel, and we got ready for the banquet that night.  She was to be the master of ceremonies and she'd never done it before, and she was scared to death.  She asked me to tell her about myself, so I did, and at that time, Stanley had dogs, of course.  I told her that we had two daughters and that my husband had 13 dogs.  She was excited, and in the middle of the banquet she was introducing me, and, sure enough, she says, “She's the mother of 13 dogs and has two children.”</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Do you suppose that poor soul has ever lived that down?</hi>
</p>
<pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
<p>GINN:  I hope so.  [Laughing] I hope so.  But when you deal with that kind of volunteer situation, why things like that always happen to you.  But it was an extremely good experience for me.  I developed a considerable knowledge of many colleges and universities.  I met many educators, and the wonderful women who were involved were a great source of friendship and encouragement.  I know I grew a lot through my relations.  It made me much more knowledgeable about universities and colleges and young women.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  You did a lot of traveling, obviously, so you got the sort of scope—</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  The University of Vermont, when I was inspecting them for a Mortar Board chapter, they didn't have a guest house, but they had nobody in the infirmary and so I stayed in the infirmary.  [Laughter]</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  With hospital beds?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  With hospital beds, slept in one.  There was a difference in the ease of travel.  Some of the trains I caught, some of the planes I took, I'd be reluctant to do now.  I remember going through the railroad station in Boston late one night.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  The North or the South Station?  Can you recall?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  The North Station.  I wouldn't do it now.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  No, you wouldn't.  Have you seen it lately?  We don't like to go through it in the daytime.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Well, even then I was a little uneasy, and that was when you still wore hats when you traveled.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Yes, I know, and gloves.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Oh, of course.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  And girdles and silk stockings.  It was almost like putting on armor, wasn't it?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  It was armor of a sort.</p>
<p>
<pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  And the white gloves that wouldn't stay white in New York City.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Oh, no way.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  And the little veils on the hats.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Oh, yes.  I kept my collection of hats.  Stanley loves hats, and he bought some Mr. Johns for me.  Gorgeous.  Saved them all.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Mr. John's hats were gorgeous.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  And some of my—he calls them my busy and professional clothes—and some of those I have saved, So there's a record of the change of the dress, of the professional woman.  Of course, all at the same time I was working in politics, I was working in the Republican women's clubs.  I guess it was about '54 I was elected state president of the Federation of Republican Women in Missouri.  That was just the same year that we built our first house.  So then there was more traveling and more speaking, and then relationships with the National Federation of Republican Women.  I always had more work to do than I could ever do to my own satisfaction.  I couldn't find the time to put as much spice into it as I would like.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  I have an entry here that in 1939 you were on the board of directors of the Missouri Stores Companies.  Would you tell me about that?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  All right.  That was my father's business.  Stanley and I both were on the board of directors from that time on until last year when it was sold.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Until 1986.  You said the business was sold to Barnes &amp; Noble.  You just got tired of all the details?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Yes.  We had something that they really needed, which was the computerized wholesale textbook business.  You can imagine the difficulty of handling the tremendous number of titles.  And when we started that phase it was called the Missouri Book Services.  It was put together as the computer came into being, and none of the other wholesale textbook people could do that.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Whose idea was that?</hi>
</p>
<pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
<p>GINN:  Stanley's, and my two brothers'.  They did it.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  So in addition to all of his other activities, he's had a guiding hand on this business, along with yourself.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  You better believe it!</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  So, you and your brothers were all active.  Was that interesting?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Very.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Trying to decide what would be needed in the various schools?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Uh-hmm.  You don't make the decision of what they need, you find out what they want and try to provide it.  Of course, it's a very interesting business because you're dealing with students all over the United States.  It's been a very, very interesting experience through the years to serve college students.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Is this basically a distribution business?  That is, you buy them from publishers?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  We buy them from students.  You see, this is second-hand textbooks.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Oh, I didn't realize that.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  You buy those books from them.  You provide new textbooks also, but you go to the campuses at the end of terms, you send your representatives, and they buy back the books the students don't want and then you send them into this central clearinghouse.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  I see.  So that's what they do with second-hand books.  I thought people just threw them away.</hi>
</p>
<pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
<p>GINN:  No, there was a time when you did that, and it worried me tremendously.  When I went to China, I said, “There's got to be some way for these books—those English books, history books, chemistry books—have a life after the time that the professor who wrote them wants to make a new edition.  So we finally, through the—I think it's Board of Christian Education in New York, and Books for Asia, and an arrangement that I made in Xi'an, China with the Teachers' College there, were able to get through.  It took us about a year to wade through all the bureaucracy, and we sent, I think it was about 26,000 books to China.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Was this a gift?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Yes.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Really!  What a bonanza for the schools in China!</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Well, you see, when textbooks are superseded by later editions, they don't have much use for students here, and yet they're still perfectly good books.  In many instances, they are equally as useful for students.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Certainly they are.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  It was a matter of great sorrow to us when you see a truckload of books being hauled to the dump.  It just does something to you.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Yes.  Well, when you father was running the business, I had thought he was selling new books.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  He did.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  So this part of the business came later?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Much later.  The boys started it.  I guess it's been about 12 or 13 years.  It kind of grew up with the oncoming of the computer age.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  That's very good to know, and I'm sure it's been a big help to the students, too.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Yes, it has.</p>
<pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Is it nationwide?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Yes.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Oh, that's why college bookstores in the East now have used books sections.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Sure, it's Missouri Book Services.  The retail outlet went under the generic name of Missouri Store Company, but on the University of Colorado campus it's Colorado Bookstore, and in California at Berkeley it's Campus Textbook Exchange, and in Michigan in East Lansing, it's Campus Bookstore.  There's four or five of them in Florida on college campuses down there.  It was an interesting, very interesting business.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  I should say.  How often would the board meet?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Oh gosh!  Any Saturday or Sunday night that business needed to be talked about.  There was an old oak dining room table where we all gathered.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Was it strictly family-owned and run?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Yes.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  All family.  [Pause] You also did some hospital work.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Yes.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  On the board of directors?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  No, I wasn't on the board of directors.  I helped win one of the auxiliaries.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  What did you do?</hi>
</p>
<pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
<p>GINN:  Oh, I forgotten what it was.  It was probably more during the time when they were building a new hospital, and they had tried two times to pass the bond issue.  We knew that we needed it badly in the community.  Stanley was much a part of that, too.  We couldn't afford to have a professional survey team come in and create the figures showing the need, so a good friend of mine and I said we'd do it.  So we did the survey and we called on the board of trustees.  We just helped make it possible.  For that kind of election, a bond election, there's very little community interest unless there can be some kind of personal involvement, Stanley said, “We must put something else on the ballot.” He said, “Let's use the dog leash law.” He got a man in the community to be in favor of the dog leash law.  The hospital bond issue just became a minor issue, but the dog leash law got the people to the voting places.  And we got a hospital.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Isn't that great!</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  It was fun; it was a hard job to get it going, but worthwhile.  Worth the time and trouble that it took.  I guess I'd forgotten about that.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Who were the friends of Arrow Rock?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Okay.  Arrow Rock is a settlement that's about 75 miles, probably due south, from here.  And it was where the Louis and Clark expedition came through, across the Missouri River there, and there was an early, early tavern.  It was quite an early settlement.  The Friends of Arrow Rock were responsible in the restoration of the old tavern that was there, and trying to rejuvenate the village.  I was simply on that board, and helped them for two or three years.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  I see.  You've certainly have had experience being on boards.  Now all of this time you were a member of the Missouri Republican Speakers' Bureau, and that means that you were asked to make speeches at X place, on Y day, and so you would prepare your speech and go out.  How many speeches do you think you would give?  I suppose, during a campaign, you would give more.  Or was it—</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  It was all the time.  I just don't have any idea.  I probably could get out my engagement books, which I have kept, and find a listing of many of them, but I just wouldn't have any idea of how many.  I would have to say hundreds.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  And you were president of the Missouri Women's Republican Club.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  The Federation of Republican Women.</p>
<p>
<pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  What did that entail?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  That is the auxiliary arm of the political party, which was put together to provide a club unit and encourage activity politically in between elections to maintain interest in the party.  It was at its height then, both nationally and locally.  That was before the exit of the woman from the household with free time in the afternoon to go to meetings.  [Now] she has a job, so it, along with many of the other women's clubs, organizations, has suffered a decline now, in '87.  We've seen that.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  But in the '50s and '60s, it was at its zenith?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Yes.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  And what was your work?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Well, I was State president and I worked on some of the national committees, but I never asked for national office, because I think it was—oh, I guess it was 1960, I was elected National Committeewoman from Missouri for the Republican Party, and that added the dimension of a lot of responsibility.</p>
<p>The national political party and the Republican Party have two representatives from a state, one man and one woman.  Recently the rules have been changed to include as a member of the national committee from each state, the state chairman of the party, so there's three representatives from each state.  Now this is true in the Republican party; I don't think it's the same in the Democratic party.  That gave you a responsibility for the development of the political program, as such, in the state—the communications link between [it and] the national party.  You were responsible for the drafting of the rules for the national conventions and for the business of the party which had to be done at the national level.  You were responsible for the distribution of your invitations for the inauguration when your man was elected to the presidency, and it was simply the liaison work between the states.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  I see.  The states and the national committee.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  When Rogers Morton was the chairman of the Republican National Committee, he appointed me as the chairman of what he called the “DO” Committee, which was Delegates and Organization Committee.  We drafted a rewrite of the rules for the '76 Convention.  It was the first time that they had given a woman the responsibility of that large a committee in the political party.</p>
<pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  And you were chairman?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  And I was the chairman.  It was the counterpart of the McGovern Commission.  I was not running for president, so I didn't jump up and down and say it should be called the Ginn Committee.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Now these were the rules of the convention; it has nothing to do with the platform.  Am I right?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  It has nothing to do with the platform.  It's the rules for the operation of the convention, the election of delegates.  We did a study of the different ways that the delegates were elected, the different time tables that were responsible for it, and there were really many different plans for the elections of delegates.  They're done at different times in the different states.  It still is an independent structure within the states; there's lots of autonomy in that which I think is good.  Now with the advent of primaries, its' going to change, and I don't know yet.  In Missouri, we'll have a first primary this next year, in March.  It's going to make a change in the political system, but I guess if any system is viable, it's got to be ready to accept change.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Well, this upcoming primary, is that to elect delegates?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  No, I think it is to express preference.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  In other words, you will go in and put a check beside a name—</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Yes.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  —of one of the leading candidates, Bush or Dole or Kemp.  That person will already have his delegates, and if you check that and he wins the most, his delegates go.  Is that how it will be?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  I don't know in Missouri.  I think that the laws are different in the different states, and frankly, I've not studied the fine print in the Missouri one.  I don't think it's a binding primary; I think it's a preference—indication of preferences.  Since it's so new, and we're trying it for the first time here in Missouri, why there will be some growing pains with it.</p>
<p>
<pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Will it be up to the state or to the national committee as to who gets seated?  Or has that not been decided?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  No, because this will be an indication of preference of candidate; it will not be the selection of an individual who will go to the convention to cast the vote.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Well, then, when will that come into the process?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  In the past, it has come through the caucus systems, the county meetings.  You begin with the meeting in the ward, the precinct, the county, the congressional district, and the state, and there are different layers where some of the delegates are chosen.  I don't think this primary is involved with that direction.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  So that will go on anyway, just as it has; I see.  I had the idea that the primary might supersede some of that.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  No, in some states, it will, but I don't think in Missouri it will.  And I have a feeling that there will be parts of our own new law that we'll have to change.  Stanley and I have talked about this, and there's a number of things that have not, to our satisfaction, been resolved.  It's all right; it's proper growing pains.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Why is there this move toward the primary in so many states?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  I don't know, I just don't know.  I don't know whether it's an effort to get more people to be involved in the political process.  It certainly is a boon to the public relations people, the media people, and it could place much more control in the hands of the media than we may want.  But it's new, we've got it and we'll have to try it and see how it works.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Have you ever been involved in the process of the party platform?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  No, I've never been on the platform committee.  I've been in lots of platform committee meetings, but there were always so many other aspects that intrigued me.  I was happy to let people go and rant and rave over the major platform of the party.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  You're really concerned with the business of the things—the nuts and bolts, the getting the thing going . . .</hi>
</p>
<pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
<p>GINN:  Yes, yes.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  It's a good thing people do want that.  The others are more emotional, and transfer perhaps, better to the media than what you do.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  When the '76 convention was opened, I presented the gavel to Senator Edward Brookes.  Much of that kind of platform work is canned—given to you.  This gavel was given by the orange growers in Florida who, of course, have made great donations to the Republican Convention, and all that stuff, and so they sent over this speech that I was supposed to give about the gavel.  [Laughs] “Ohhhhh!” I said, “Stanley, I cannot say that stuff—all about the orange juice running through the veins of the wood, where the gavel was cut from.” He said, “Just don't do it.  Throw it away and write your own speech.” Which I did.  [Laughing].  Oh, trauma.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  That must be quite a sensation, to be up there speaking to such large numbers of people.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  I think they figured there were 80 million people.  I still have the dress.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Do you?  You must have big closets.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  I do.  I'm a pack rat.  I don't ever throw anything away.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Really?  Have you always been that way?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Yes, always.  Might need it.  Just never know in this world when you might need something, which is why my files are such a forest.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  No, it's a good thing.  Historians down the line are thrilled to come upon treasure troves like that.  So often correspondence, particularly, gets tossed out.</hi>
</p>
<p>You kept up your ties with your Tri-Delt sorority, too.</p>
<p>GINN:  Yes, yes.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Building Corporation Trustee, 1956.  Were they building some new—?</hi>
</p>
<pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
<p>GINN:  No, that was just the parent corporation that raised the money and paid off the mortgage and that sort of thing.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Well, why don't I give you this list, which I copied out of your Who's Who entry, and you comment on these as you will.  We've already touched on some of them.  They begin here and they go over onto the next page.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Okay.  Now, there's one comment here in this beginning career bit where you talk about sex discrimination, and I really feel that I was very fortunate in the 40 years when I had much public responsibilities that they would give me responsibilities as the first woman to ever hold a job.  I was the first woman who was ever National President of the Association of College Honor Societies, which is all of the honor societies on college campuses.  One of the national meetings that we had was held at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, and in Ann Arbor at that time, in the student union building, women were not permitted to go in the front door.  They had to all go through the side door.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  You don't mean it?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  So here was this national meeting there and the president was a woman, and she could not go in the front door.  I thought it was the funniest thing I'd ever heard of.  I said, “I'll go in the side door.  I think it's utterly funny.” And I made very light of it.  But that was then.  After that, it was changed.  When I was on the Board of Trustees of Kemper Military School, it was a boys' school, of course, and sometimes they would have their board meetings at the University Club in Kansas City.  That was fine, except there were no women allowed above the second floor unless they were brought in up the back elevator for reasons other than [those for] which I was there, and so I couldn't stay there.  I'd go over to the University Club to the meetings on the mezzanine floor and then I'd have to walk next door, back to the Hotel Muehlbach to stay overnight.  Now, of course, that has changed.  But that was a kind of discrimination.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Did you make any comment on this?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Laughed, just laughed.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  And that has been the way you have handled this situation, To literally shame them into it?  And it's proved effective.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  I think it has; I really think it has.</p>
<p>
<pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Well, men don't want to be confronted, do they?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  No.  Then they're put on the defensive.  When I was on the national commission for UNESCO, I was the first woman ever to be national chairman of it, and that was very interesting, because by then it had developed into a more acceptable thing to have a woman be the head of a bisexual grouping like that.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  What year would that be?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  1974</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Oh, really?  Well, that's quite a while ago.  Now, at Kemper, were you the first woman to sit on the Board?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Yes.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Uh-hmm.  Going back to the Republican national committeewoman stint you did, where was most of that work done?  Did you have to go to Washington for that?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Yes, four or five times a year.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  And did you go alone?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Yes.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  You did, and your husband encouraged you to do all those things, didn't he?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Absolutely.  And paid for them.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Did he really?  The committee didn't, you did.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  We just set a budget every year for our political involvement and he made it possible.  And he's always encouraged me, pushed me to do whatever I . . .</p>
<pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
<p>I had a very good friend who was in Mortar Board with me, did Mortar Board work.  She was National Treasurer.  She had a bank and lived in San Diego—no, closer to L.A. than that.  Her husband said of her, “It's like being married to a tiger.  You never tie her up, you just pat her on the behind and let her go.” [Laughter] Now let's see.</p>
<p>But I have to believe that treating what could have been confrontations on discrimination, I helped soften by laughing.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Good point; good point.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  All right, now let's see here.  Where do you want me to begin with this?</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Well, just any of those that we haven't touched on.  Would you tell about them and what you did?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Yes, the budget committee for United Fund was a good experience, from '55 to '57.  I think I was the only woman on that budget committee at that time, but the men that I worked with were excellent people, good people.  A number of them were professors from the university and that was a good relationship.</p>
<p>And then the Columbia Board of Health; that was a different experience for me.  I'd never been in that field before.  I had no responsibilities in that kind of a situation.  It was simply a review of what the professionals did on the board.  There was no patient involvement on that sort of thing.</p>
<pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
<p>Hospital Auxiliary was during the time when [we] were trying to get the new hospital put together, which we did.  The Friends of Arrow Rock, we talked about.  Advisor of Columbia Council of Clubs: that was a good opportunity because representatives of the various volunteer clubs in Columbia met.  How can we combine the strengths that all of our organization have in order to make the best use [of them] in the community?  We could create projects and take on jobs that were far beyond the perimeter of each individual club.  It was a good group; bright women, lots of fun.  Then the Lawrence County Women's Republican Club—that was probably one of the earliest ones.  Yes, it was; '37 and '38.  That's just the bottom step in that political hierarchy, also in Boone County, Missouri.  There was the Republican Speakers' Bureau, Young Republicans' Club.  I just encouraged them when we were trying to get that group started here in the state.  I would go to the county, district and state Republican conventions.  You'd better believe it.  Alternate delegate at large to the Republican national convention in '56; that's right.  Permanent secretary, Missouri Republican convention; that's just an honorary-type title.  Seems to be like it was in '56 that I made a speech nominating somebody; must have really been a good one.  It did good things to bring confidence.  Then '60, Republican national committeewoman from Missouri.  That was the beginning of the change of field.  And then member of the executive committee on the Republican national committee—there's wonderful people who all work as volunteers.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Really?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Oh yes.  They all pay their own expenses.  Some of them have support from their state parties, but, by and large, that is a volunteer group.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Now at this point did you get to know Anne Armstrong?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Yes, yes.  This was when I knew Anne.  And Mary Brooks.  And, Ellie Peterson from Michigan, and Claire Shanks Williams, now of Florida, and Mary Louise Smith of Iowa.  There were great women in that group, and they were all leaders.  They were strong women.  They were women who had worked hard in public affairs when it was much harder than it was in my time coming along.  They were great unsung, unrecorded women.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  I'm sure.  Just plain hard work, a lot of this.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Yes it is.  Millions of letters, millions of telephone calls, millions of times when you needed to provide what help you could for your constituency.  And it's an important job as a citizen.</p>
<p>
<pb facs="0060" n="Page0060"/>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  It is.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Now in the National Mortar Board Foundation, that was the one that I referred to a little while ago, the one that the young man is the recipient.  We formed the Mortar Board National Foundation at the national convention, when we met in the Pocano Mountains at a wonderful resort.  Wish I could pull its name up.  Could be Something-hill; what is that big wonderful hotel?  I'll never forget: we went into the dining room and the little waitresses who were waiting for their guests were seated at the table with their hands under their aprons.  I never will forget that.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  How does this scholarship bear your name?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  The National Council of Mortar Board named it in my honor.  I was in Paris when they decided.  I was there as a member of the United States delegation to UNESCO.  They sent me a cablegram and told me that it had been named in my honor, and I was very pleased.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Of course!</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  The Association of College Honor Societies—we've talked about that.  That was a very interesting group of people.  They were all people who served the organizations, the honor societies that they represented, as volunteers.  There was no paid employee.  The association's headquarters were at the University of Tennessee in Knoxville.  The executive secretary was in the engineering school.  It was just a group of dedicated people who thought that maybe smart students could be encouraged and they were trying to find ways to do it.  It was worth the time and effort that I put into it.  Then when I worked as expansion director for Mortar Board, the requirements for the acquisition of a Mortar Board chapter were pretty strict and Mortar Board expanded slowly.  They have expanded much more rapidly in recent years than we did then.  We visited two or three times the colleges and the campuses that were applying for a chapter.  The facilities for women, the courses that were available, the presence of a Phi Beta Kappa chapter on the campus, the physical facilities, the faculty were [all] a part of it.  It was an all-purpose investigation.  The Association of Accreditation of Universities didn't do any more thorough a job than we did.  I was responsible for expansion for about six years.  Then when I was national president of Mortar Board, from 1948 to '55, well, then I was on the road a lot.  I traveled to many colleges and universities.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Speaking?</hi>
</p>
<pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
<p>GINN:  Speaking.  I remember a speech that I gave in Glenwood Springs, Colorado.  It was at the banquet of the national convention.  I started out by saying, “All day long I listen for a whistle.  It means Stanley is coming home, and I hear him when he comes through the door.  With it he brings his greetings and his pleasure to come home, and he leaves all of his office troubles outside the door, and it means that we're ready to have our family together.” That was published in the Mortar Board Quarterly.  I like that speech; that was one of my favorites.</p>
<p>Now then, in the National Association of Women Deans and Counselors, that organization was exactly what it implies.  I was the representative to it for Mortar Board for two or three years.  Mortar Board maintained close association with that group because they were the closest advisor/counselor/protector of the women students on the campus.  Now I haven't heard very much about that organization lately, but there was a great storehouse of powerful women who served as deans of women.  Sometime we ought to remember those women, because they broke down lots of doors.  I remember the dean of women who was dean when I was in the University.  She was Dean Bessie Leach Priddy.  She told about when she was early on in the game, traveling to visit a university, and she went to this hotel and she retired to the ladies' room and she sent the maid from the ladies' room out to the desk and said, “Please send in the man and register me for the hotel.” A lady didn't go to the front desk.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  No, really?  For heavens sake!</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  That's right.  [Pause] American Legion Auxiliary.  My work in the Auxiliary was really more in the help I gave them and Girls' State, teaching politics there.  '56 to '74.  I told you before that all of the members of our family worked with Girls' State.  When Stanley first started, he was so young, so handsome, wearing the Colonel's uniform of the State Patrol, and he taught law.  Of course, the girls all wanted to take law.  [Laughter] Oh, it was great.  He was over there teaching law when Sally was born, and the Missouri River was in flood, and he had to cross that Missouri River to get back in time to welcome her, so he had to have a highway truck pull his car through the high water to be able to get across the bridge, but he made it!</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Exciting times out here.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Oh, I tell you, it is.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  How long was he in the Philippines?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  A year; a little more than a year it was.</p>
<pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
<p>Now in the League of Women Voters, I maintained a membership, I never did really do a great deal for them because theirs is more theoretical than my interest in politics has been.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Yes, it is, and it's apolitical.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Yes, it really is, and I'm not particularly apolitical.  The Kings' Daughters has been an interesting group.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Who are they?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  That is a philanthropic group.  It's a national association.  In Missouri, we maintain a home for elderly ladies, over here at Mexico.  It has some religious overtones, but it isn't religion-oriented, particularly, and we're philanthropic in our support of the ladies' home there and we do other bits of community health and support.  My mother was a member of the King's Daughters, also.  This is a younger group.  We've been in existence about 25 years.  I do a Rosemary book in which I list all of the members, all of their children, all of their grandchildren, all of the birthdays, all of the wedding anniversaries, all of the statistics that you need about your good close friends.  I'm right in the middle now of doing this.  It's been nine years since I've revised the book.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  What do you do, make this available to them?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  I give it to them.  It's going to be my Christmas present.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Oh, how lovely!  I bet they really peruse it, don't they?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Oh, they do, and they use it.  In the beginning, there were about 25 women who were a part of it.  We now have more than a hundred grandchildren from that group.  We don't have any great-grandchildren yet.  We've lost about six of our original members and we've lost nine husbands in the time.  And all of these women are college graduates.  Many of them were early professional women—Red Cross workers in World War II, teachers.  They've had thousands of hours of college training.  They're just a wonderful group of women, and it's been a great pleasure working with them.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Where did you say this is?</hi>
</p>
<pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
<p>GINN:  Kings' Daughters—it's a national organization, but the Missouri—the home that is our primary responsibility is in Mexico, Missouri.  And, of course, Phi Beta Kappa.  They just pat you on the head and hope you stay out of trouble.  Alpha Kappa Delta was another one of the honor societies.  The University's was Delta Sigma Rho.  Alpha Pi Zeta is your Arts and Science Honor Society and then Tri-Delta sorority and the Baptist Church, of course, is self-evident.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  And you're still active in your Baptist Church?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  No, I am not.</p>
<p>The UNESCO experience was very rewarding.  It was really my first association with the State Department.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Tell me how that came about.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Well, let's see, that was in '72.  It was after the election and there was another commission in which I had expressed an interest.  I think it was a college-related board in the State Department.  I can't recall what its name was.  They said that was not available, but the national commission for UNESCO was.  I have long since learned that if you go where they would like to have you, why life becomes easier, and so I started my association with that.  I was a faithful attendant and I did whatever they asked for me to and I enjoyed it immensely.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Now when you say you asked for this, to whom did you ask?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Through my political connections at the time.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Through the state political connections.  You expressed an interest . . .</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  And the national.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  I see.  So you expressed an interest and were told a place was available on the UNESCO commission.</hi>
</p>
<pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
<p>GINN:  Yes.  We had exceptionally fine support from the people of the State Department.  Even then, you could sense that there was a concern about the way UNESCO Paris was being operated.  It was a long time—this disintegration of relationship with the U.S. Government—it was a long time in coming.  The people who were on that commission were, of course, very bright and very interesting to work with.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Were you a study group?  Was that what you were doing?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  No, you didn't really study, you reviewed what the general sessions of UNESCO did.  You were supposed to be the sounding board within this country of what UNESCO was doing, what it meant.  We had very few independent projects, which we did on our own, outside of communicating what UNESCO was to various groups.  We held a couple of seminars; one on environment, which really produced some very fine work.  I was sent by our government to a general session of UNESCO in Paris.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  That must have been interesting.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  It was fascinating because it was during the time of the Woman's Year and there were two meetings on that.  There was one held in Bonn, Germany, and I was there as one of the U.S. Delegates.  And then the one in Paris.  I was assigned the responsibility of the resolution that was to be passed by that session on women.  It was a fascinating study, because you know how that madhouse works.  Here were the Russians, and they were determined to have what they wanted, and here were the Middle East and here were the Far East representatives, and the English, and the Spanish, and the South Americans, the Colombians, and the United States, the Canadians, the Finns.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  And don't forget the Africans.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  You'd better believe it.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Now was M'Bow [Amadou Mahtar M'Bow, one time Director General of UNESCO.]</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  This was before M'Bow.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  You read where he tried to get back in?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Did he make a run at that?</p>
<pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  He did, and he was defeated.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Well, I'm not surprised.  But I'll tell you about M'Bow later.  When we were confronted with this possibility—the probability—that we did want to get a good resolution through the general session.  I figured if we got them all together and got them all involved in the beginning, then it would be their resolution whatever we offered, and so we did.  The United States gave a luncheon there in the UNESCO Headquarters.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  This was in Paris?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  In Paris.  And we invited every woman who was a delegate there, from all over the world, and put them at round tables.  There were about 10 or 12.  Their instructions were that they were to describe what they themselves wanted to see in that resolution.  So everybody got to have her say; everybody got to have her talk.  Appointed a secretary at each table.  They worked for a couple of hours.  It was good, everybody had a fine time, and then I gathered up all the papers and went back to the hotel and closeted myself for a whole weekend, sorted it all out, put it all together, and then went back to the same group again to see if it would satisfy them.  It took very little variation from that that we produced.  Then I sorted out the ones that could be the key troublemakers and asked them to second the motion in the General Assembly, so they got to get into the act.  And it worked.  It was passed in the General Assembly and all votes were affirmative except one, Saudi Arabia, and he couldn't vote on the equality of women.  He always maintained he didn't know what he was voting on.  [Laughter] But it showed me that if you understood the basic humanity of people and if you supply as many of their needs as you possibly can in trying to get them all moving in the same track, that it can work.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Was this your idea, to approach it this way?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Sure.  Because frankly, I don't think that the men thought any great thing about it.  Here's this women's resolution; we've got to do something about it.  Let's give it to Rosemary.  She's a good guy and she'll work on it and they did, and I did.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Well, why was there such a mess at Austria, at Vienna?  Did you hear about that one?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  I don't think that they had a chance to coalesce.  There was no opportunity to get them all together and yet let them all have their say.</p>
<p>
<pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  It has to be done at the beginning.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Yes, it has to be at the beginning.  Otherwise they're on their defensive.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Did you get this idea to run it this way from your political experience?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  From all of the times that I have ever tried to put together any kind of a resolution in any club for the 40 years previous.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  You had done so much working with women.  Well, that's a very interesting story.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Now, when I went to the Bonn meeting, in Germany, at that situation, in that meeting, I was not in a position to provide that kind of leadership.  You have to be in a position of leadership to do that.  There we never did end up with a synthesis of opinion and we encountered the Russian technique of the introduction of something absolutely unacceptable at the last minute.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Right.  But in yours, in Paris, you got the Russian woman to go along.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Yes, sure, sure.  Got her involved, gave her a place on the program to make a speech.  She was supporting the passage that was important to her.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  And didn't use it for a political polemic.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  That's right.  It can be done; it can be done.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  The Paris one came before the Bonn one?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Yes.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Very interesting.  Well, it's encouraging to know it can be done.  I don't quite know how UNESCO completely got away from the United States.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  We turned our back on it.</p>
<p>
<pb facs="0067" n="Page0067"/>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Because we certainly were supporting it.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Yes.  Oh, Lord, yes.  The money we sent over there was just humongous.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  And they used the money for a multitude of little bitty projects all over the world that didn't amount to anything, weren't necessarily successful.  Dissipating energy, really.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  We were dissipating money and we were dissipating energy.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  It was a stepchild, wasn't it?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Yes, that's a good name for it.  It was just set off on one side, kept from starving to death, but neglected.  Of course, from my own personal point of view, to pull out of it and go away from it is just giving up.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  What do you think should have been done?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Why, I think we should have moved in strongly and I think it could have been retrieved.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  With better leadership from our side?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Yes.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Stronger positions?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  And people who understood what the nature of that problem could be and was.  M'Bow came to this country to pay an official visit.  He did during the time that I was chairman of the national commission of UNESCO, so I went back to Washington to greet him properly and entertain him.  The poor man had had problems with his luggage coming over, and they'd bashed all of his luggage up, so he needed luggage.  So I said, “Well, do you know any place to go here in Washington?” No, he didn't.  “Why,” I said, “Come on.  I'll take you shopping.” And I did.  I took him over to Lewis &amp; Thomas Saltz and helped him find some luggage and a gift for his wife, who is also a lawyer.  I just looked after him, and he appreciated it; he appreciated it.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Of course he did.</hi>
</p>
<pb facs="0068" n="Page0068"/>
<p>GINN:  He's a very interesting person.  He's a product of his own culture and civilization, which is a little bit different than that he would have had here in the United States.  And in the work that he did there for UNESCO, he only did what, from his background, was the expected thing to do.  It's too bad it had to turn out the way it has.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Yes, it certainly is.  And then, too, I have heard it said that it was used as a dumping ground for American diplomats or political people.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Well, it could have been, but that's not a singular organization to have that happen and it's not only in politics that you have to have a place called the turkey division.  But there were some wonderful people who worked in UNESCO over there.  The general session lasted for six weeks when we were there.  I had great respect for many of the people who were there.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Wasn't our main criticism that much of the resources of UNESCO were spent on operating expenses in Paris?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Yes.  Now that's not hard to do in France.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  No, of course not, but especially if they had fleets of cars and that sort of thing.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Oh, yes.  Well, power, you know.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Exactly, that was their way to show power.  I suppose the same thing happens at the U.N.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Why, of course.  People know how to abuse power pretty well.  Let's see here, where are we?  If I had a choice again to go back into active service, I would want to be the ambassador to UNESCO.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Would you?  You really feel that you could make things work there?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  No, but I could sure take a different tack.  [Laughs]</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Now, you mean UNESCO, as opposed to the U.N. in New York?</hi>
</p>
<pb facs="0069" n="Page0069"/>
<p>GINN:  That's right.  My talent, I think, would work far better in the UNESCO field than in U.N.  U.N. is so unwieldy and there's so many forces at work there that I don't know how any single individual could make any difference, really.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Yes.  One question I wanted to ask you because you have done so many things , particularly in the area of women's organizations, particularly.  What are your feelings on the women's liberation movement?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Oh, I think it's coming along, if we don't foul it up by making a nuisance out of ourselves.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Did you ever make any speeches on that subject?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  No, I don't remember making speeches about it.  Again, my approach—the laughter—has been the most effective.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  So you were not involved in the ERA passage?  Well, what do you think about it now?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  I'm just very sorry it was not ratified.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Are you angry at the male politicians who refused to vote for it?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  No, because I understood that the men, for example, in the State of Missouri, who were in the House of Representatives and in our state senate, had to vote the way they felt their constituencies felt, and there are areas in the state of Missouri which are very conservative.  I know the pressures that were put on those people so I didn't go around tearing my hair.  I knew that the men who could vote for it, would.  And they did.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  This understanding, of course, comes from your own involvement in politics, which most people do not have behind them.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Yes, and it was a great sorrow to me that it was not passed in Missouri.  It was close—very close.  And I think that the fact that it wasn't passed has dimmed my enthusiasm for active participation in politics.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Is that so?  Really?</hi>
</p>
<pb facs="0070" n="Page0070"/>
<p>GINN:  Yes, I really think so.  Because here for 40 years you knock yourself out trying to get these people elected to these offices, and then when it comes to a critical time they, because of their own relationships, are not in a position to support something that you would like to see happen.  So it just dims it a little.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Sure it does.  Did you speak out?  I mean, did you give lectures on ERA?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Oh, yes.  I made speeches about it.  Talked about it.  But I didn't wave flags or all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Very interesting.  Well, now we're up to the point, I believe—have you gone through that list of activities?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Yes, I have, but there's some notes here that I made after I read back over the resume that I gave you, things I've done.  I have been a member of two federal panels for the selection of U.S. District Judges.  It's the first time that it's been used in the State of Missouri, to use a panel to select and recommend to the U.S. Senators, and I've served on two of those.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Now, how do you get to serve on a panel?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  You're appointed by your United States Senator.  The first one that I served on, I was the only woman, and the second time, there was one other woman.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Which Senator appointed you?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Danforth.  When he first ran for the Senate, I encouraged his little wife, Sally, to campaign.  Neither of them had ever been in politics.  She sat at our house, at our dining room table, and we were trying to encourage her, and she said, “Well, I'll go out and campaign if you'll go with me.” So I said, “All right, Sally, I will, because it's important.”</p>
<p>I think she and I traveled to 70-some-odd counties.  She was a total novice.  She had never been in any kind of public situation like that, but she was willing.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  And you were her mentor.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Lovely young woman.  Lots of guts and grits.  She could do it now by herself.</p>
<pb facs="0071" n="Page0071"/>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Well, yes, but she had to start.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  And that was fun; that was fun.</p>
<p>Then I was on a federal panel for the selection of the United States magistrate under the same kind of a recommendation system.</p>
<p>In Missouri there is a group that is chosen of Missouri citizens who are allegedly outstanding in what they have done, and they're called the Missouri Squires.  We meet for lunch once a year in the governor's mansion.  There are three women in it, and I am one.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Are you a squirene, a—?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  No, no.  [Laughs] I'm just a squire, because if you add an E-S-S or an A-S-S at they end of it, why it changes the philosophy.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Yes, indeed.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  And then I'm a Kentucky Colonel.  I'm a honorary citizen of Tennessee.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Now who made you a Kentucky Colonel?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Well, the young lady who was the Republican national committeewoman from Kentucky; wonderful woman.  It was she who offered my name.  Then I'm a Sagamore of the Wabash, which is the same kind of an honorary situation in Indiana.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  This is through your political work?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Yes, yes, and aside from the federal panels that I've served on and the work that I've done with the Squires—and we have interesting things coming up that we're going to do—well, then I've been on the board of directors of the Friends of the University of Missouri Library, which I enjoy very much.  They have just built a magnificent new annex.  I've been kind of helpful to them there and will continue with that.  Next week I'll meet with the chancellor of the university and their librarian and we're going to see what we can put together.</p>
<p>
<pb facs="0072" n="Page0072"/>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Is this in your persona as a squire you're doing this?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  No, this is completely separate.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Which hat is this?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  New hat.  But I've been responsible for one of their publications that they have, internal communication among the people who are on that board.  That I find very interesting.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  What sort of things do the Squires do?  They are the leading people of the State?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Well, mostly they eat lunch once a year together and pat each other on the back, with the governor, but we have hopes that they will be involved in the development of the new rare book room in the library.  That's what we're going to work on.  They don't know it yet; but that's what we're going to encourage them to do, and I think they'll be interested because it's so rare to build a library, and one which will have our western manuscripts collection.  The University of Missouri Library is one of the largest west of the Mississippi River.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  I'm amazed that so many things have been saved and are available.  It's wonderful, because it was such a transient population for so long.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  But remember what their problem was.  Their problem was they couldn't take any more than their teams of horses could pull, so they left it.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Oh, I see.  And that's why it all ended up here.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Yes.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Uh-huh, and went to settle in other places which have to do without their collections because you have them.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  That's right, that's right.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  I see. Well, it makes perfect sense.</hi>
</p>
<pb facs="0073" n="Page0073"/>
<p>GINN:  And with our interest in development of the rare book room and the rare manuscript room, I'm hoping that we can have a collection of original manuscripts of Missouri authors—even up to now—the current authors, if they will give their current manuscripts.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  That's the way to do it.  If only you could have gotten hold of the Mark Twain ones, the Sam Clemens ones.  They're all at Yale aren't they?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  They may be.  They may be.  I ran into a man not too long ago whose roots were in Elmira, New York, where Twain's family lived.  His is a totally different picture of the man. I hope to have him come and speak to the Friends of the Library; I'm afraid it will shock a few of them to find out what Elmira thought about Mark Twain, but that won't hurt 'em.  [Laughs]</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  No, indeed.  Why?  Is he sort of deified out here?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Oh, yes!  But now the next thing I'm going to do in the next year will be the house that I'll have to design, and I have written a book and I've got to somehow get it published.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  What is your book about?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  It's the story of one of the earliest English missionaries who was sent to China.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  How did you get involved in that?  Was that a family connection?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Yes.  It's a great, great, great uncle, Walter Henry Medhurst.  He was sent out by the London Missionary Society.  I've been to England two or three times to research there at the London Missionary Society and Dr. Williams' library, and all those good things.  I've been to China and I've been to the place where there's a street named in his honor and talked to people who knew of the work he had done there in Shanghai schools.  The manuscript is complete.  I have to redo some—you know how you have to tighten those things up after they come out of your brain.</p>
<p>Three years ago I went to China with seven friends.  We were semi-official guests of China, and one of the young women who was our interpreter was Mrs. Sion Nu of Xian, China.  It's way back in the interior where the terra cotta soldiers are.  When we were there, we were royally entertained by the Chantze Teachers' College.  We visited their library, and it was to their library that the books went that I mentioned.</p>
<pb facs="0074" n="Page0074"/>
<p>We liked the people there.  They wanted us to go to one of the bakeries and talk to the businessmen.  They were anxious to have machinery to make more loaves of bread than the people could make with the machinery that they had.  Of course, they didn't bother to keep any of their ingredients under refrigeration, including their eggs, which just sat in a warehouse with open doors, so I could see why they needed new machinery plus a lot of other things.  But we loved it.</p>
<p>The young girl who was the interpreter I thought was so bright and she was so thoughtful and kind and careful.  She was an official government interpreter.  As we went through the country, I said, “If there's ever any way that I can help you come to the United States, I will.” So after I got home I started to work on it.  I said, “Stanley, would it be all right if I invited Sue (which is her American name now) to come and live with us and go to the journalism School at the University of Missouri?” I said “She'll learn more about crazy Americans and how to interpret for them by going to the journalism school than she will anything else.” And he said yes, it would be all right, so we began our negotiations with the Chinese government.  We were finally able to get the university to agree to accept her as a special student and the Chinese government to let her come.  I said, “Sue, you get the government to pay your transportation and we'll take care of all the rest of your expenses.” She came and lived with us and went to the university there.  It was a wonderful experience for her.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Well, of course, it was.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Because she understood Americans after that.  She read American literature.  That was the year that Shakespeare was taken off the banned list in China, so she got to read Shakespeare here before she went back home, and she went to see a play.  They had a production there at the University.  We gave her all of the American experiences that we could.  She left her little 7-year-old boy.  Her father-in-law came and took care of him while she was gone.  Her husband worked for the government also, the foreign affairs area, and worked in the development of commerce in one of their new commercial zones down there, very close to Hong Kong.  They were equally bright.  The things that Sue told me about life in China: the year she spent out on the farm feeding pigs during the Cultural Revolution, the problems that they had, their distress over the government edict of only one child.  She said, “We've decided that we will solve it because there are children who are available for adoption and we will adopt a little girl.” So that's how they're going to solve it.  Sue was a wonderful little lady.  I figured that even though there may be more than 100 million of them, there's one that's had a chance, and we loved every minute of having her here.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Did she stay a whole semester?</hi>
</p>
<pb facs="0075" n="Page0075"/>
<p>GINN:  Yes, she stayed a whole semester.  She was absolutely terrified of examinations, because you know what examinations in China mean.  The whole family fortune and reputation is based on the outcome of examinations of their children.  We arranged that she didn't have to take any final examinations.  That let her relax to study, and she was very diligent in the work that she did.  Then this year her government sent her back with the Golden Monkey exhibit which they sent to be shown in Minneapolis at the zoo, and over at Milwaukee.  I got to talk to her on the telephone two or three times but I did not get to go and see her.  But she's fine.  She's coming along.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  And obviously has an important position.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Yes, or they wouldn't keep entrusting her with that kind of responsibility.  Her English is as fluent and as middle-western, as good as it should be.  She can handle any kind of a translating assignment.  But when she went to college she wanted to study chemistry.  Apparently the students go before a board there and apply to study this, that and the other kind of career and they said, “No, you cannot take chemistry because you are so little, the fumes in the laboratory would bother you.  You must study languages.” So now she is fluent in English and in Russian and Chinese.  When she was here, I gave her all the chemistry books I could for her to take back home.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  It's a wonderful thing for you to have done.</hi>
</p>
<p>All of these experiences and responsibilities you had certainly prepared you for this step in your life that is of particular interest to this study, and that is your becoming an ambassador.  Would you go over the steps that led up to your receiving that appointment?</p>
<p>GINN:  One Sunday morning, Stanley Ginn invited me to go out to breakfast with him.  That was our usual practice.  And during the course of the pleasurable time he said, “How would you like to be a United States ambassador?” I didn't have to think very long before I replied, and so I said, “Why, it'd be the most exciting thing I can imagine.” We had been discussing the night before the fact that there would shortly be a vacancy in the ambassadorship to Switzerland.  He and I had spent a month in Switzerland several years prior to that time, and we enjoyed it.  We liked the people and felt like it would be a comfortable place to be.  So he said, “Well why don't you just write your senator and ask him about it?” And I did.  I also wrote—at that time it was President Nixon who was in the White House—and expressed my interest in that position, and in due course, the response came back through various channels that the position in Switzerland was to be filled by a career person.</p>
<pb facs="0076" n="Page0076"/>
<p>You know how those things go, you write to all of the senators for whom you have campaigned, with whom you have worked, and all of the people whom you felt might be appropriate persons to recommend.  And they did.  Then the word came back that the post in Luxembourg would shortly be vacant and that that might be a proper place for me to go.</p>
<p>Well of course Luxembourg would have the same quality of life that Switzerland would have had and besides, they had good hunting there, and that, I am certain, added a little desirability.  So we said yes, we would certainly be pleased to be considered for that post.</p>
<p>All of this took a number of months, and by the time that the actual induction as an ambassador came about, why, Gerald Ford was president.  He confirmed the prior recommendations that had been made, so we went back for interviews at the State Department, and indoctrination, and so forth.  They made it plain that they wanted us in position at the post by the 26th of June, which was the time for the celebration of the Grand Duke's birthday.  That gave us about four weeks at the Department.  As you know, that's not very long to learn all of the things that I should have known.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  No, that's an awfully short time.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  But we worked hard at it.  We worked all day every day, and I worked back in the hotel at night.  Up to that point there had never been any straight out man-to-woman look in the eyes saying, “You are going to be the ambassador for the United States to Luxembourg.” It was all around the corner.  This was protective on the part of the State Department.  They hadn't had a chance to meet me, to know me, to see if I could absorb, if I could carry the job, and I'm certain that it was still in a case where they had not made a final commitment which would have been embarrassing for them to have to back away [from].  However, about three weeks after we got there, the time came, they said, for us to have a physical examination there at the State Department, so we went over early that morning and they started through all of the tests.  You may want to expunge this part of your tape, but I think it should be known for the record that there is a part of the test where they give you a small bottle and you retire to the bathroom.  There's a small door on the left side of that little room, and pretty soon that little door flapped open and there was a bottle placed upon it, an empty one, and on the label it said “Ambassador Rosemary Ginn.”</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Oh, no!  [Laughter]</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  That was the first tangible, official expression that it was going to happen.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  That is a new one.</hi>
</p>
<pb facs="0077" n="Page0077"/>
<p>GINN:  [Laughing] Well, of course, both Stanley and I are totally healthy people.  So, there was no out for them through that point, and we have laughed about that, chuckled about that, ever since.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  When did you go before the Senate?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  During that time, but not until after this had occurred.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  You hadn't even been before the Senate?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  That's right, but nearly all of those men on that Senate committee were men with whom I had worked in government and politics, either on the same side or opposite sides, and when we did go, I'd have to give the Department great credit for the people they assigned to us to brief us on what the committee would be likely to ask and what we should know about it.  If there was anything that we should not say, they clued us in and they prepared us, and of course we tried to listen as well we could.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Well, how many of these meetings did your husband sit in on with you as far as the briefings go?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Not very many.  No, not very many.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Did he help you study at night?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Oh, yes, he would.  But you see where there is the reverse, where it is the woman who's the ambassador, the same kind of indoctrination for the man who goes as the spouse isn't provided as there where it is the woman who goes along as the spouse.  I think there well could be.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Now they do have the husband sit in on the spouse's lectures.  There is part of a day set aside for the running of the embassy from the spouse's point of view, the embassy being the residence.  The husband sits in on that as the wife goes off to her secret briefings.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Well that's good, because Stanley assumed those responsibilities there.  He hired the chef, he hired the butler, and he saw to it that they did what they should—sometimes to their consternation.</p>
<pb facs="0078" n="Page0078"/>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  What a relief for you.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Oh, my!  It just made the whole job possible.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Can you remember who was on your Senate committee, the Foreign Relations Committee, when you appeared?  Any funny stories?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Well, of course, Senator Percy.  Then, oh, a Democrat senator, Symington, Sr., Stuart Symington.  I had gone to call on each of those senators before the hearings were held.  During the hearings themselves, before I was called, there was a congressman questioned who was being appointed to be the ambassador to Sri Lanka and the Maldive Islands—and he didn't know anything about the Maldive Islands, period, and they turned him down.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  They did?  Right then and there?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Right then and there.  They said, “We regret we cannot accept your appearance at this time and we'll have to discuss this later.” Well, of course, that was a bit of a scary thing to .  Number one, that they'd turn down a congressman, but anyhow, they did.</p>
<p>At that point, Senator Symington got up from his chair, up on the raised level, and came down and sat beside me.  Now he and I had been political adversaries ever since both of us had been in politics; gentleman that he was, there was not a matter of controversy between us, there was a matter of two citizens of Missouri.  He gave me quiet counsel there.  He said, “Don't tell them everything you know.  Just directly answer their questions.” And yet there was another question that was asked and he said, “Don't answer that.” He would say that in an aside.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  You mean he sat there while you were—</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Right there during the questioning.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  So he didn't question you himself?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  No.  So I listened to him and answered their questions as best I could and there was no problem.  They immediately told me that they approved and that their recommendation would be forwarded to the Senate, and it was, and it was passed with no dissenting votes in the Senate.</p>
<pb facs="0079" n="Page0079"/>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Was it?  Unanimous.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Uh-hmm.  I have a copy of the issue of the Congressional Record that shows the vote of confirmation in the Senate. It was May 20, 1976.  It's framed.  I thought it would be fun.  The briefings that they'd given me in the State Department, the counsel that they had given me, and the help that he gave me there in the hearing made it a smooth passage for me.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Indeed, indeed.  Were there several of you sitting at that table that day?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  No, no.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Just the two of you?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  That time there was just Senator Symington and me.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Really?  After the other gentleman had been—</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Oh, yes.  The congressman stormed out in a great huff.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  I can imagine.  Well, I can only think that he just hadn't gone to his State Department briefings.  Don't you think so?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  I rather imagine that.  He probably thought it would be a pushover and hadn't bothered to go find out about it.  He should have known it's only nine feet above sea level.  [Laughs] Of course, Sri Lanka is in such a mess anyhow. The Maldives—who are served by the ambassador to Sri Lanka—there's nothing there but fishermen, but it is in a strategic sector of the Indian Ocean.  Where we have, I think, warships.  Not right there, because the water isn't deep enough.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  But right nearby, which is why we have the post.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Right.  But after that, we continued with the indoctrination at the State Department.  They were very kind to me.  There was strong support from the people on the Luxembourg desk, and then the people who were in the UNESCO office were delighted and pleased, and they were helpful.</p>
<p>
<pb facs="0080" n="Page0080"/>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Did you know the people on the Luxembourg desk?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  No, not ahead of time.  When the time came for the swearing-in party and process why, of course, it was held there in the State Department.  We served Luxembourg wine.  Part of my family came from Missouri for it.  My two brothers came.  It was a highly satisfactory, simple little ceremony, no great bells ringing or lights flashing, that sort of thing.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Up on the eighth floor?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Yes.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Who held the Bible?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Stanley.  It was my Bible that he had brought for me, on my request, from Missouri.  He had gone home to try and straighten out some business halfway through the briefings and when it became apparent that the swearing-in would occur shortly, I called him and said, “Please bring my Bible.” So he stuck it in his little brown piece of carry-on luggage and got on the airplane and sat down next to two priests.  When they were aloft, why, each of the Fathers opened his reticule and took out his Bible and started to read, and Ginn looked over and saw these two, so he reached down in his reticule and got out his Bible and opened it to read.  He recounts the two priests looked and looked and looked, and finally one of them said, “Sir, are you a man of the cloth?” Stanley confessed that he was not a man of the cloth and told them why he was carrying the Bible.  Stanley was to meet me in New York for the courtesy calls that are made there at some of the offices, and when I got to the Ambassador Club to meet Stanley, well, here were the two priests with Stanley, so I got to meet them, too.  Oh, they laughed at great length about how they thought Stanley was a man of the cloth.  Can you imagine any more non-man of the cloth than that boy?  I can't.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Who administered the oath?  Was it the Chief of Protocol, perhaps?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  A young lady, a nice young lady, about my height—could have been the Chief of Protocol.  Could it have been an Assistant Secretary of State?</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Yes, it could have been.  I just wondered.  Quite often, it's the Chief of Protocol or the Deputy Chief of Protocol who does it.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Could have been either one of those, but I'll have to look it up.</p>
<pb facs="0081" n="Page0081"/>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  But it was a State Department official?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Yes, oh yes.  It was not Henry [Kissinger].</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  And then you gave your little speech.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Yes.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Were you able to have the ambassador from Luxembourg there?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  No.  Wait a minute.  Was he there?  He must have been.  You know, I was pretty excited that afternoon.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  If he were in town, I'm sure he was there.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  He was very kind to us when we were there in Washington.  He invited us to his embassy for dinner and we had a good relationship with him.  Not only then, but later on through the years and since we've been back.  I felt like he represented his country very well.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Of course, they leave their people here a long time.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Oh, yes.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  What about buying clothes for the assignment?  Was that a problem?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  No, because everything in my wardrobe was going to be new to Luxembourg.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  A good point.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  I think I took 16 formal dresses with me, and probably already had all but three of them.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  You had had to have so many in your lifestyle anyway.</hi>
</p>
<pb facs="0082" n="Page0082"/>
<p>GINN:  Right, right.  I did buy a new dress for the presentation of credentials to the Grand Duke.  it was a peach-colored, floor-length, ultrasuede.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Peach-colored, floor-length, ultrasuede?  Sounds gorgeous.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  It was, and I bought it at the Watergate shop in Washington.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Was it a one-piece dress?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Uh-hmm.  I really didn't have to buy any great wardrobe for it, 'cause when you've been in public life after so long a time, you're pretty well covered for any kind of a situation.  There was one other navy blue, long-sleeved dinner dress that I think I got at Garfinckel's.  But I didn't have to go into any great wardrobe.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  You already had suits, I'm sure.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Oh yes, except I don't wear suits.  I wear long-sleeved, plain, trim dresses.  Which Stanley chooses.  He chooses all of my clothes.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Oh, yes, that's what you were telling me.  He actually goes with you?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Oh, absolutely.  If he isn't with me, I take them home on approval.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  So he really is a help in your .  .  .</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Oh, you better believe it; you better believe it.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Were there any articles written by the press about this back in Missouri?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Yes, there were, and there was one newsman, Henry Clay Gold, who was the Washington correspondent for the Kansas City Star.  Henry had followed me around for years and years and years, through the politics and he paid as high a compliment as any press person could.  He said, “I've followed this woman for 20 years and she has never said the wrong thing.” I count that as one of the highest compliments that I have ever had.</p>
<p>
<pb facs="0083" n="Page0083"/>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  I should say.  I should say.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  The St. Louis Post-Dispatch did a very nice feature article.  They sent their people to see us after we got to Luxembourg.  There was proper and adequate press coverage.  Then the people in Columbia gave a reception for me one Sunday afternoon in one of the hotels, and it was received well.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Well, now, you came back to Columbia after the swearing-in.  Just to pack up?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Yes, we had five days to pack, but we had good friends in the moving business and my dear daughter Sally came down from Iowa, and we just threw together—we took some Oriental rugs and the silver and our favorite dishes, and that sort of thing.  Stanley took his hunting boots, of course.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Did you go to the Art-in-Embassy place in Washington?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  We did, and when they said, “What would like to have?”, we said, “We would like to have pictures of wildlife in the United States.” They looked aghast [and] said, “Nobody ever asked for that before.” But they were extremely helpful, they got on the phone with some galleries in New York and they found us the American mountain goat, all kinds of big eagle pictures and wildlife stamps.  Wonderful—duck stamps—the series of those.  Of course—Luxembourg is very interested in stamps and it made wonderful conversation for guests who came to the embassy.  Then Stanley has a beautiful 23-lb. wild turkey mounted that has hung in our house over the fireplace.  So, by golly, we just boxed him up and shipped him to Luxembourg and hung him in the dining room.  And, of course, nobody over there had ever seen an American wild turkey before.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  23-pounder!  I never knew they got that big—wild ones.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Oh, yes.  The biggest one he's ever shot weighed 23 pounds.  They're big birds, big birds.  We took that as a part of us.  Apparently, after an ambassador goes to a post, why there's a mild question as to whether or not the interior of the embassy suits, or whether or not this and that and the other should be done.  Well, I didn't feel that it was my place to redecorate the whole thing.  As Stanley says, “Every old hen has to fluff the feathers in her nest,” so I moved the furniture around and we did paint the living room white, instead of pink as it was.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  It was pink when you came there?</hi>
</p>
<pb facs="0084" n="Page0084"/>
<p>GINN:  It was pink.  [Laughs] We took some Oriental rugs with us and that helped a little.  But that is—it's a modest-sized residence.  Have you been in it?</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  No, I have not.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  It's a modest-sized residence, very homelike.  The room in the basement level with the bars on the windows they said had been in place since before the war.  It was the German embassy during the war, and there had been prisoners incarcerated there.  We stored extra pans and canned food in it.  We didn't tell people that some were supposed to have been killed down there and shoved [out] through the coal chute.  So, the house itself had a history.  In the front hall, the chandelier was the one that Perle Mesta had given to the embassy, a beautiful chandelier.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Was it?  Prisms?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Yes, great.  And the hall was a two-story-high hall with a three-sided stairway that went around it.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  It sounds lovely.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  And up on the second floor there was one, two, three, four—there were five bedrooms.  And, oh, what was that wonderful man's name who was ambassador there before?  Oh, his name must come up.  But he was very kind.  He was very helpful to me.  In fact, he and his wife gave a dinner party for us in New York.  Oh, I'm distressed that I can't pull that up, but it will come up.  When he and his wife had been there, she told us, there were no closets in the master bedroom at all, so they moved up and lived on the third floor for several months while there was a dressing room cut off of half of the master bedroom.  So then, that made it very comfortable, because there was plenty room for clothes storage.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  How was the plumbing?  Did you find it unusual?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  No, no.  It was civilized.  And the house itself was very comfortable.  There was no insulation in the attic though, and I reported that to—not Buildings and Grounds, but when I came back to Washington after my tour of duty, that the United States could save a considerable amount of money if they just put some insulation up there.  I'm sure they threw the report away.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Not necessarily.  You'd be surprised.</hi>
</p>
<pb facs="0085" n="Page0085"/>
<p>GINN:  But it did need that.  In the attic, it was full-sized.  There could have been three or four more bedrooms put up there.  The ironing room was up there in the attic, if you can imagine, of all places.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  How inconvenient to have to climb up and down.  Well, did you take your books with you?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  No, no.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  You didn't bother with that.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  No, we didn't bother.  Oh, there were a few that we took, but we didn't move the library in any respect.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Did you leave your home open back here?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  We just walked out and locked the key—left it, so we didn't have to dismantle it or put things in storage.  Oh, in five days there's no way we could have done it.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  No, I didn't see how.  Well, now, in that time, you could not have had any language training.  You started that when you got there?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  That's right.  Wonderful French tutor.  She would get up, come to me every morning at 8 o'clock.  I'm very grateful for her.  She was originally from the town of Le Mans, where the automobile race is run.  That was her base.  The people at the embassy said that French from that area was pretty overall accepted as the right accent to have, so I was very grateful for their perception and the fact they were able to find her.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  She worked for the Embassy?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  No, she came in as a private tutor.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Especially for you.  Very good.  One thing on this side of the Atlantic, were you received by the president, by President Ford, before you left?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Yes, I was.</p>
<pb facs="0086" n="Page0086"/>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Would you tell me about that?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Stanley, of course, went with me.  We had known him for a long time.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Oh, you already knew him.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Yes, because of the work at the Republican national conventions and the national committee and all of our political responsibilities.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Oh, of course.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  He was very kind and gracious there in his office.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  This is the Oval Office?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Yes.  But he gave me no special instructions.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  No special instructions?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  No, he really didn't.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Did he have his picture taken with you?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Oh, yes.  Which I have.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  How you fitted all this in in that one month, I don't know.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  I don't know how we did it either I really don't.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  When you went to Luxembourg, you went by plane, I assume.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Yes, TWA.</p>
<p>
<pb facs="0087" n="Page0087"/>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Did you stop anywhere en route?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  No, just went right through Paris and right on over.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  No stopovers.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  When we got there, of course, why we were met by Dan Phillips and the chauffeur and the car and the young lady who was to be my secretary.  We went right back to the residence.  All of the members of the staff and the officers were there, and we had a little reception there together and got to meet them all at that point and so it was an easy beginning.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Tell how you felt when you were sworn in and you heard those very solemn words and then you repeated those very solemn words.  What went through your mind when you put your hand on the Bible and .  .  .</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  “Lord help me do it.” Scary as all get out.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Had the fear dissipated a bit by the time you arrived there and met the staff?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  It wasn't really fear.  It was concern that I do a good job of it.  But I think the one experience that I had that probably will always stay with me was the time when the head of our Marine Corps's enlistment expired and he wished to re-enlist.  Giving that man his oath I will never forget, because I wasn't Rosemary Ginn then.  I was the United States Government.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  You were the government, yes.  It's quite an experience to have had, quite a privileged experience to have had.  You couldn't help but feel that you were the United States?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Yes, which is the traumatic part of that, because, “Oh, lord, help me from taking the wrong step, making the wrong, smart remark, stepping on the wrong foot.” When I went to make my first call [on] another ambassador, to the man senior in time of duty, and it was the Russian ambassador and I went by myself.  [Laughs] I thought, “Oh, little Rosemary, you're in trouble.” But I wasn't.  It didn't take me long to find out the man was a fisherman.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Did you take your translator?</hi>
</p>
<pb facs="0088" n="Page0088"/>
<p>GINN:  No, I had not.  I had to use his translator, who spoke English very nicely and well.  The ambassador pretended he did not speak any English, though I know that trick, too.  So many of the things I would say to the translator, if he spoke any English at all, went directly to him.  But it wasn't as traumatic as I thought that it might be.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Had you worked out exactly what you wanted to say to him?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Yes, I knew.  I knew what I should.  Dan Phillips, of course, briefed me as to what was proper, and I was always careful enough to consult with him.  I didn't have to go off on any wild goose chase and think I knew how to do it.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Was it used as an occasion to “send a message,” as they say?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Sometimes.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  In your case, was it?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  It was not.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Could we hear about the meeting with the Grand Duke?  How soon did you present your credentials?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Oh, it was very shortly, because I really was not official until those had been presented.  It was either the next day or the day following.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  That soon?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  That soon.  The Grand Duke sent his car and his chauffeur and his footman for us, to take us to the palace.  The first thing I discovered was that the attach�, whom he had sent, had been held in the arms of an American soldier when he was a baby, during the war.  I knew that he had a strong feeling about Americans, which was very fortunate.  All through the time that we were there we saw him any number of times that we'd go to the various functions.  He was a Luxembourger, but he was also an American at heart, and that was good.  But the actual presentation was a very simple kind of a ceremony.  Have you been in that palace in Luxembourg?</p>
<p>
<pb facs="0089" n="Page0089"/>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  No, I've never been to Luxembourg.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  It was in the city.  The royal family has several, of course, several palaces.  He was in residence at the city palace, which is in the heart of old Luxembourg.  You ride through the great doors into the courtyard, and you get out under cover and go into the little waiting room.  On one side is the gun room, and my heavens, there were cases twice as long as my arm can show filled with historic guns.</p>
<p>You go into the Gold Room, the little room on the other side, and sign the Gold Book, showing that you were there.  There was a stairway in that little palace with great wide stairs of marble, wonderful railings that come down the stairway and curl out in the proper angle.  And at the top of those were—is malabar the green stone?</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Malachite?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Malachite.  Jardinieres that were this tall of malachite at the top of this stairway, beautiful mirrors with gold frames up that stairway and then divided in back, and at the top you were in kind of a waiting hall.  You waited there for a very few minutes and the footman came in and took you into the waiting area.  And from there they came for you and took you into the next room, where the Grand Duke and the Grand Duchess waited to receive us.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Did you take any of your staff with you?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  No, no.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Just your husband and you?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Just Stanley and I went.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Did you withdraw the credentials of your predecessor?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Yes.  Had to make it official, if I remember correctly.  Isn't that right?</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  It depends on the place.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Well, they warned me to be sure and do it, if I remember correctly.</p>
<p>
<pb facs="0090" n="Page0090"/>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Yes, usually that's the way it is.  But I have run across .  .  .</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  First you do that and then you give your own.  They stood to shake hands with us, to receive the documents, and then they were seated and they invited us to sit down, and we did.  They talked about their children, they talked about their family, they talked about their dogs.  We talked our dogs, we talked about our children, we talked about how fortunate we were that our countries were such good friends and partners in this world, and it was a very gentle, low-key social visit.  There were no innuendoes, no messages subliminally or otherwise to be delivered.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Did you have a translator with you?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  No, they spoke English, beautiful English.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  I suppose it lasted about a half an hour, maybe?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Maybe twenty minutes.  And they stood, and we withdrew.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Were they all decked out?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Well, yes.  She had on a long dress, but he had on a uniform with full array of medals.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Oh, yes.  It must have been pretty impressive.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Oh!  Can you imagine!  Here, little girl—country girl, from Columbia, Missouri, being received by the Grand Duke?  Yes, ma'am.</p>
<p>Unbelievable trip, particularly coming in from the outside of that kind of officialdom.  If I had been to a swearing-in before, like that in the State Department, it would not have been all so new and foreign.  The whole thing was a new wonderland, so I had to be doubly careful because I had no past experience that I could rely on, make judgments from, or adapt.  That's why I was so lucky to have James Daniel Phillips there.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  You got along with him right from the beginning?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Oh, absolutely.</p>
<p>
<pb facs="0091" n="Page0091"/>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Yes.  You had the opportunity, I'm sure, to select your own DCM.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Oh, yes, I could have.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Why did you decide to take a chance on whoever was there?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Well, he knew the ropes.  If anybody else were brought in who hadn't been there before, nobody would have known the ropes.  He already had the good contacts with the men in the government and that kind of rapport can be very valuable.  And I had no complex about his knowing more about it than I did.  I was grateful to have him there as a counselor at my side.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  You just took it as a given that you would get along him, or that he would get along with you, I should say.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Sure, sure.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  You didn't meet him before?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  No.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Do you know how rare this is?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Is it rare?  Q:  For it to work out?</p>
<p>GINN:  I'd like to know.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Well, I would say one in a million, maybe.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Really?</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  The biggest problem is with the deputy chief for any ambassador, and particularly since the deputy is always career, if the new Ambassador is non-career, there is often terrible friction.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  I can see why there would be.  No, it didn't bother me.  I was grateful he knew more than I did, because if all he knew is what I knew and less, then we didn't have a very good team.</p>
<pb facs="0092" n="Page0092"/>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Did you select your own secretary?  You mentioned the young lady being there to meet you.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  No, she was there.  She was wonderful.  I still hear from her.  Wonderful little girl, dedicated.  She lives in a suburb of Washington.  Even the day that girl's mother died, she came to work at the office.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Really?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Yes, and we had to insist that she go home.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Has she resigned from the service now?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Yes, she's out of the service now retired.  She was highly recommended to me by the department, and I was very grateful.  Really, it was a good team.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  For the record, what was her name?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Ellen Brugger.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  And you tell me that James Phillips has now become an ambassador?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  That's right.  And he, Dan Phillips' and his wife, they were not in good accord within their own relationship, and consequently, their little girl, Katie, was happy to spend time with us.  She did, she spent lots of time, spent lots of nights with our granddaughter, Callie, who came to live with us there.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Callie didn't come with you when you arrived?  She came afterwards?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  That's right.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  How did that come about?</hi>
</p>
<pb facs="0093" n="Page0093"/>
<p>GINN:  Well, I just felt if there was any way I could share that experience with somebody else in my family that it would be worthwhile.  Sally's daughters weren't old enough that they could have assumed a semi-adult responsibility, and Callie was her father and mother's choice to come.  At age eleven, they're kind of both flesh and fowl, and she could be grown up if necessary but she could get out and play football with the boys if that was what she wanted to do.  So it worked out very well.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Did she stay the whole time?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  The whole time.  Went to school at the European school of the Common Market that they had there.  Had half of her classes in French and half of them in English.  Did well in her studies.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Did she have to have special training in French?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  She had had French.  She had lived in Switzerland for a year, before. Dr. Almond took his whole family to Geneva when Christopher was just a year old, and he went to establish the Heart Surgery Department at the University of Geneva.</p>
<p>Callie had been—she went to a little village school there, in one of the suburbs so that she had enough French that she could .  .  .</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  She could handle it.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Yes, yes.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Who else did you have on your staff?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  I am ashamed to admit that the intelligence people, the administration officer .  .  .</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Economic?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  The economics officer, and Dan Phillips.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  How about a consular officer?</hi>
</p>
<pb facs="0094" n="Page0094"/>
<p>GINN:  Yes, yes.  There was one of those.  But I won't go into intelligence.  Economics was Hawkins, and his wife was there.  There were a number of other secretaries.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Yes.  Was the admin officer also the economic officer?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  No.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  You had two separate ones?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  That's right.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  They were combined at one time in Luxembourg.  Hawkins and administrative.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  I'll have to look those up.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Well, those names I can get.  They list the officers but they don't list the secretaries.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Right after we'd been introduced to the chef and the butler they announced to us that the 4th of July was coming up very soon and they had invited 1,500 people for a picnic.  Wow!  Oh, dear!  They had rented a chateau out, north of Luxembourg City, which was a chateau that had been taken over by the government—the Germans—during the war, and it had been used as a prison, and some of the officers of Luxembourg wouldn't come.  They told us later because they had been incarcerated there, and it had very sad and traumatic memories for them.  We invited the mayor of every town in the country, all of the city officials in the country, of course, all of the government people who should be, and many of the people who were supporters of the Americans, the American Women's Club and all of that.  Eighteen hundred people came and four dogs.  We drank up every coke that we could find from the Bitburg Army Base in Germany west.  The cookies that the American Women's Club made were just in the hundreds.  It was a beautiful day, sun shining, of all things in Luxembourg, which is kind of rare.  It was in the garden of the chateau which had been built in the fourteenth century.  There were great statues, four representing the great sections of the world.  There was one that was faced towards the building; it didn't face out into the garden, and that was in the direction of the United States is.  They didn't know anything about it when the chateau was built, so it was turned away.  But the band that came just played Luxembourgeois music and American music, and John Philip Sousa has never had his music played any more times than it was that summer in Luxembourg.  Every week there would be a band concert some place and of course we would go, receive the flowers, make a short speech, admire the children and the music.</p>
<p>
<pb facs="0095" n="Page0095"/>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Oh, the bicentennial, of course!  Dan Phillips had set all this up?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Set it all up, had it all in order, and when I saw what they had done, I just said, “Amen.  Let's go.” The night before that big party we had a beautiful symphony concert for those that weren't the picnic types.  The dear Prince Charles, the brother of the Grand Duke, who came to our concert with his wife, Joan Dillon—</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Of the American Dillon family?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Yes.  She was there, too.  And he confided to Stanley, “I've got my swimming suit on under this.  I'm going to go home and jump in the swimming pool.” He was a wonderful soul, wonderful soul, as was she.  She brought her children to the picnic the next day.  She said, “I wanted to have them have a feeling of something that's really American on this Fourth of July.” Her chauffeur was off on that day, so we sent a car for her, and she came, and, oh, those little people had the best time.  They could run and play with other little children with the freedom that in the royal apartments they didn't have.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Yes, of course.  It must be constricting life to them—to live that way.  When you arrived, what were U.S. relations with Luxembourg?  Was everything going along well?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Everything was going along all right, except they had had some problems with the prior American ambassador [ Ruth Lewis Farkas, May 1973 to March 1976.  Resignation accepted May, 1976.] and when my name was submitted to them they said, “We don't want her.” So then the United States sent back the message, “We regret that you don't want this lady.  We want her.” So when I went, that was the kind of a situation that I went into in so far as the government. . .</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  I see.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  But they softened up and I didn't have any problem.  I just played like there was none and there was never any attention paid to it.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Did you get any feeling when you first arrived of this antipathy?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  No.</p>
<p>
<pb facs="0096" n="Page0096"/>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  You didn't.  They were polite.  How long had it been since the last ambassador had left and you came?  In other words, how long was Phillips in charge?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Must have been two or three months.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  He did not show any signs of being sorry you had arrived on the scene?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  I never had that feeling, never had that feeling.  Either he didn't have it or he concealed it well.  Oh, he's a great person.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Where'd you say he is now?  Ambassador to what?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Burundi?</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Good for him.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  But we loved his little daughter, Katie, and I loved his wife, Rosemary.  Oh, she was a great girl.  But she was caught in the beginning of when the wives in the department were feeling that their contribution to life, liberty and the pursuit of diplomacy were not particularly well-acknowledged.  And they were right, of course.  So it just somehow—there may have been other reasons which I don't know anything about, but it magnified itself, and by the time he finished his tour of duty there and they came back to the United States, when they had decided to separate.  The woman to whom he is now married was a widow from Baltimore.  We went back to his wedding.  She's an excellent woman.  She's a scholar in her own right.  She has children of her own.  He brought her to see us at the Piney River house in Missouri and we all stomped up and down the river together.  He's also been stationed in Casablanca since Luxembourg.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Has he?  One of his predecessors in Luxembourg was in Casablanca, too, as consul general.  Isn't that a coincidence?  Fred Galanto.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  That's the name I've been trying to think of—Fred Galanto.  It was he with whom I worked in UNESCO.  He was stationed in Paris when I was there.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Fred was in Paris?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Yes.</p>
<pb facs="0097" n="Page0097"/>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  I didn't know that.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Okay.  He is a first class character.  He is so smart.  The Lord better look out for him, and I know that if the devil isn't scared to death, he will be shortly.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  How often did you have staff meetings?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Every Monday morning.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  In your office?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  My staff, in my office, absolutely.  The country team about once a month, because part of our people, like our military attach�, was over in Brussels and they'd come down.  Of course we had no military problem, and the entire Luxembourg Army consisted of the band, I think, and four spare horses, or something like that.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  How many Marines did you have?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  About a dozen.  Good, good boys.  When my grandsons came to visit, Pierre Blanchard, a Marine, taught them how to raise the flag, let them participate in the ceremony.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Oh, did he?  How nice!</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Oh, it really was.  And my granddaughter, Callie, who lived there with us, lost a tooth while she was there.  She buried it under the flag pole.  [Laughter]</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Gave it a good Christian burial</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  On American soil.  [Laughter]</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Aren't children wonderful?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Oh, they really are, they really are.</p>
<p>
<pb facs="0098" n="Page0098"/>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  How did you conduct these staff meetings.?  Were these done on collegial lines?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Very, very informally.  We all had coffee to drink.  We went around the table and everybody could speak his mind, and we worked through what we had ahead of us in the next week, what there was that was special that would be coming up or could be coming up—very informal, low-keyed; no formality or parliamentary procedure.  It was just a good team meeting.(Reading):  “Relationship with head of state, members of the cabinet.” I was very fortunate to meet the members of the cabinet, to call on them, and the heads of the departments, and to visit with them.  Fortunately, there, all of those men could speak English.  I visited them in their offices to call on them.  They felt at ease and were relaxed.  Of course, the war experience was so real and so near that all of those men were seriously involved, and some of their conversations were very frightening to hear.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Yes, our war was so different from what they experienced.  We were not invaded—conquered.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  That's right.  One of the NATO projects that occurred while I was there was an exercise in which they brought German troops into Luxembourg, [as well as] French troops and American troops for kind of a NATO exercise.  It was the first time any German troops had been on Luxembourg soil and there was great tippy-toeing around about it.  The local people weren't comfortable with it and people were extremely glad when it was all over.  They held it south and west of Luxembourg City at a place where the Celts had had a camp 2,000 years ago, and where the archeological department of the University of Missouri had a dig, and here were these modern machines.  Of course, I was there as the American ambassador, and I had on my heavy boots and my camouflage suit and my dark green cape, and I shook hands with every American soldier that was there.  I told our Marine Sergeant when I got back, I said, “I was prepared for everything but the noise,” and I said, “I had never really had any concept of what the noise of war could be.” Because they were firing, the helicopters were coming in, the troops were moving.  It was just a simulated exercise that they had, and here they were on this mountaintop that the Celts had fought on thousands of years ago, only in that battle their chief was killed and so they gave up.  If your chief is dead, why then you're—you've had it.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Your side has lost.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  That's right.  But the dig was very profitable.  They found lots of coins there and then, of course, they transferred them to the museum in Luxembourg City.  It was interesting, especially that it had the Missouri connection.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Did you get to meet a lot of the local people?</hi>
</p>
<pb facs="0099" n="Page0099"/>
<p>GINN:  Yes, quite a few.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Business people?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Business people—well, not mainly.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Not mainly?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  No, just—at least once a week, I'd go to market, down into the city market in the old area and I could converse in enough German which was the language there of the marketplace, to visit with people, and they knew who I was.  I would buy things from them specially, to make a contact and that sort of thing.  And then we were careful to go to all of the invitations of the local people that we could accept.  The best thing that we thought we could do was in public relations—people-to-people, because in a country where you have no great governmental problems, why then, that should come next from our point of view, and so that's what we did.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  How did you see your job when you went over there after your briefings by State?  That your job was to maintain relations?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Maintain relations.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  And improve them?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Yes.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  On a person-to-person basis?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Right.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Did you find the entertaining load and the going to parties to be very heavy?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  It was heavy, but that's what I'd been doing all my life.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Politics seems to work very well as a training ground for diplomacy, doesn't it?</hi>
</p>
<pb facs="0100" n="Page0100"/>
<p>GINN:  Yes, I think it does.  Because in politics, the name of the game is to convince people to do what you want them to do, and as I view diplomacy, it's practically the same thing.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Yes and you have to think about constituencies.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Yes.  Oh, I visited schools.  I went to exhibits.  Just the same thing any other ambassador would have done, or has done, or should do.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Could you describe a typical day, knowing that all days are different?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Yes.  I kept a journal.  I kept notes on each day, and I've never taken time yet to transcribe them, which is too bad because, like the sunset, the color fades if you don't do it.  I would set my clock for 15 minutes before I had to get up, and then I would write the notes for the day previous.  Then I would get up.  I generally ate breakfast with Callie, because sometimes that would be the only time of day that I could see her.  Then she would go off to school.  She rode the bus to school.  At that time, there was some kind of a prohibition about families using the official vehicle.  She had to walk a block sometimes when it was pitch black.  Now, I think, I would be extremely reluctant for her to do that.</p>
<p>And then at 8 o'clock why I, would be in my office for my French lesson, and then at 9 o'clock, if it were Monday, we would have our staff meetings.  Then, of course, it's the usual day:  you have your cables, you have whatever appointment, you go wherever whose guest book needs to be signed at whatever embassy.  Wherever you go for lunch in the afternoon, it's more of the same, and eventually you get around to dictating 15 or 20 letters, and then you rush home and change clothes and go out to dinner.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Yes, or cocktails, I suppose.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  We had a pretty good way that we handled that.  We enjoy our wine and a light drink, but it's so easy to slip into the infusion of too much of that stuff.  Before you know it, it slips up on you.  So there would be maybe two days, or three days a week, we'd just cut it off entirely, and that way it wasn't a question of taking one drink and stopping.  You just did or didn't, and you divided about a third, two-thirds, and we could account for it.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  And you found that system worked?</hi>
</p>
<pb facs="0101" n="Page0101"/>
<p>GINN:  Yes.  It worked; it worked.  At that point we had not discovered any good California wine.  We served Luxembourgish wine.  Mr. Cravatt, who owned the big hotel there in Luxembourg City, had met Stanley at the Rotary Club.  Stanley went to every Rotary Club meeting in the country, every week.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  That was a big help to you?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Oh, you better believe it.  Mr. Cravatt said, “I'm going next week down to the vineyards.  You may go with me.  After I have bought all that I want for the hotel, you may buy some for the embassy.” So Stanley would go pitty-pattying along with Mr. Cravatt and they would have a great day, and Stanley would buy the wine for the Embassy.  So it gave us good Luxembourgish wine to serve to the Luxembourgers, which they appreciated.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  I'm sure they did.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  There was this funny house next door to the embassy.  We never saw any signs of family life.  The only time we ever saw anybody come or go would be very few people early in the morning, and the lights were on long.  We couldn't figure out who they were or what it was and so we made discrete inquiry and found it was a private Rothschild bank—no sign outside, no nothing.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  My word!  What was your favorite kind of entertaining?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Dinners.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  You liked dinners?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Yes.  We had a wonderful young chef whom Stanley had hired, a young French fellow, who was a superb chef.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  What happened to the previous chef?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Mrs. Farkas took her own help.</p>
<p>
<pb facs="0102" n="Page0102"/>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Oh, she brought her own people.  That's true.  So Stanley hired a chef, and that chef was .  .  . GINN:  Was French, but he'd grown up in Switzerland, and that was where he had learned to cook.  He had blond, very curly hair, and he was 23, and oh, how that boy could cook!  Mrs. Farkas had had a new kitchen put in in the main floor of the house—proper cabinets, all that business.  He took one look at it, and he would have no part of it, and he went back down to the lower level with the old stove that had a hole in the bottom of the oven, [and] put a pan over that.  Happy as he could be down there in that antique, antediluvian area.</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  It's what you're used to.  It's what you can cope with best.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  That's right.  One day I went down there and told him that I regretted to report that I thought I had seen a mouse in his kitchen.  The next day I had a luncheon for some ladies, and when my plate was served to me, there was a ripe olive with two little ears cut in and a long string of a tail on my plate.  [Laughing] I figured I'd better not criticize the boy's kitchen anymore.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Oh, that's cute.  Very subtle way of .  .  .</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  I got the message.  Of course, every now and then, the urge to barbecue would hit Stanley.  So he built one of his wild barbecues like he has here, and he would barbecue outside the door of the pantry.  The chef and the butler couldn't stand it.  They'd never seen such barbaric ways of cooking: it's terrible—no sauce, no nothing.  Terrible.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  I know, just plain meat.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Oh, just plain meat.  They would sneak and watch, and then when he did that, at the same time, the Marine on duty in the office would turn his television on so he could watch what was going on.  [Laughter]</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Oh, isn't that funny.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Oh, it was, it was.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Where did you place the most emphasis?  Which department?  On politics?  Or maybe there wasn't that much activity in politics?</hi>
</p>
<pb facs="0103" n="Page0103"/>
<p>GINN:  There really was—there was activity in politics, but it wasn't the area where I had any expertise.  I was strongly guided by the people who were there.  They were people who had been at that post for quite a while.  I didn't need to upset any arrangements.  I was careful to try and seek counsel before I went to meet a new person.  They would tell me if it was somebody that I should be leery of.  Before I went, in Columbia, Missouri, I visited with a man who was a retired Army colonel for whom I had the greatest respect, and I sought his advice and counsel.  He said, “Don't make close friends too quickly,” and that was good advice, because there were people who sought to move in that would not have been as apropos as you well know.  There's always some that try .  .  .</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Oh, absolutely.  They move in with each new ambassador.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Oh, of course, of course.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  The economic work, certainly, or commercial work, must be quite heavy, because after all, Luxembourg is such a banking center.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Oh, yes, that is true, and there were always representatives from American firms who'd be coming over there.  The banking business, of course, was growing by leaps and bounds.  I visited every American factory that was in Luxembourg, went through it.  Last winter, on board ship, the man who had been the manager of the Goodyear Tire plant was on board ship and was seated at our table, and reminisced.  (We found out he knew the doctor with whom Stanley hunted, so we sent the doctor in Luxembourg a card via Jean Gerard's office [Gerard was then U.S. ambassador to Luxembourg] because we couldn't think of his address.) I could tell him where I went in his factory, about one of the workers I saw, who was a little tiny woman managing the biggest machine I ever saw, about a design I saw in the computer of their computer room.  He was surprised, to put it mildly.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  There are several hundred U.S. businesses, aren't there?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Yes, there are many.  I don't know how many hundred, but there are good, substantial business plants.  The Luxembourger is a good worker.  They're work-oriented.  They're as much like Americans not to be Americans.  I guess there are more former Luxembourgers who live around the Chicago area than there are in Luxembourg.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Did you have a very large program in USIS?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  No, we did not.  There was no library there, no great display of American information.</p>
<pb facs="0104" n="Page0104"/>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  No library?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  No.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  So you didn't have a USIS officer?  That's curious.  Well, I suppose it was lack of funds.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Well, yes.  Now then, there's a branch of Miami University there, the one from Ohio, and they carried a lot of that kind of load for us.  We had a good relationship with them, with their Luxembourg students, with their students they had brought from the United States, who expanded their own interests and made inroads in the Luxembourg community.  That is a very good operation.  And of course the man who then thereafter—not immediately after me, but one man after—John Dolibois, became the ambassador to Luxembourg.  He was connected with Miami University, and I visited Miami University when—who was the prime minister—Thorn?</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Yes.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Gaston—when he came to receive an honorary degree at Miami University, I went to Ohio to be there.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Oh, did you?  You must have known him then?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN: Yes, I did.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Yes, Gaston Thorn has come up before in my interviews.  Who was that man who became ambassador?,</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  John Dolibois.  He was a native Luxembourger, a very bright man, nice wife.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Very good.  How was your admin officer?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  We worked all right.  There was no great personal relationship there, but he was a competent man.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  He was competent?</hi>
</p>
<pb facs="0105" n="Page0105"/>
<p>GINN:  Yes.  He was competent.  He looked after us well and that was that.  There was no great social connection in any great respect, but his work was adequately done.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Your social relationship was more with your DCM, of all of the others?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Yes, of all the others.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Which is usually the way it happens.  How about your secretary?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Such a delight.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Did you have her the whole time you were there?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  No, I had two.  I had one who was there for a very short period at first, and then the other little girl came thereafter and had her mother.  She had been assigned to an embassy, I believe in Switzerland.  She had lots of relatives in Switzerland and she had been assigned there, and then left there and came to be with me.  A totally competent young woman, delightful.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  And the other one's tour had .  .  .</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Had expired or finished.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  So you didn't have any staff problems at all?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  No, I didn't.  Only the maid who insisted on moving the furniture back to its prior position.  But we worked that out.  The secretary was a tremendous help to me.  You take a young woman like that who has had the skill and the training that those women receive, and the ultimate know-how of laid-back smarts.  Sometime you ought to pick some of those secretaries and do an in-depth study on them.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Yes, yes.  They've led very interesting lives.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Who is an unsung angel.</p>
<p>
<pb facs="0106" n="Page0106"/>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  That's right.  They are very competent.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Oh, my!  Goodness gracious!</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  I always think of them as very courageous women, too.  They go to some of the strangest places, and they seem to accept anything.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  And they don't have any great status when they are at their post.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  That's right.  [Pause] What about the money?  Did you find you were given enough money for your entertaining allowances?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  No.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  You were not?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  It wasn't.  We would have a meeting every quarter and Dan and I would figure out what the needs were about to be, and then we would present that to the rest of the team and see if that took care of their needs as well as possible, and we would just juggle around.  And when all else failed, why we'd call on Uncle Stanley for help.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Uh-hmm, you had to use your own.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Uh-hmm.  But we understood what the situation was and we went knowing what it was, so it was no great shock to anybody.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Is that an expensive post?  Right in the middle of Europe that way, I suppose it would be.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Well, you know that is a relative kind of thing.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  I know.  How was the dollar at that time?  Bouncing up and down?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Yes.  It didn't ruin our family finance.  We knew what we were getting into and we didn't go around to have the fanciest parties in the world but we entertained and we entertained a lot, and we entertained adequately.</p>
<p>
<pb facs="0107" n="Page0107"/>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  And you entertained the way you would have back here?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Sure.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Did your husband have anything to do with the menus as well as the wine?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  No.  [I] had a wonderful little social secretary.  She would meet with the chef and they would cook up a whole flock of menus, and they would send them over to me and I would say yes or no.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  I see.  Was she a Luxembourger?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Yes.  Very bright girl.  She has since moved to the United States.  She has married an American and lives in Washington.  Bright girl.  Sharp, sharp.  Marian—I can't pull up her new married name.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Did you feel you had enough policy guidance from the Department?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  I would have wished for more.  Dan Phillips was my only source with experience, really.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Yes, I see.  Did you ever have recourse to call on the President or the White House?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  No.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Would you have if you had had to?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  No, I would have called the Department of State.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  That is interesting, because one of the points that is made by many political ambassadors is that they have a clout that a career person wouldn't have, because they could go to the President.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  But if I had felt that, I certainly could have.  There was no problem with that.  But from my point of view, my team route went through the Department.</p>
<p>
<pb facs="0108" n="Page0108"/>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  You are very much a team player.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Yes.  I can't imagine anything any worse than calling the President directly, bypassing the State Department, leaving them out sitting in the cold, not knowing what's going on in their own playhouse.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  But it happens all the time.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  I'm sure it does.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  It happens to George Shultz.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Well, when I get to be President I will instruct my Ambassadors.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  I hope you will.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Just tell them, by golly, if they've got anything to say, they go through the State Department first.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Well, you know the excuse they use.  They always say, “I am the President's personal representative,” which they are, but at the same time, they also represent the people of the United States.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  That's right.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  It's a very interesting thing.  How do you feel about the idea of a committee to look over the names of people being proposed for ambassadorships, the way you served on a committee to appoint judges?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  I think it might be very satisfactory.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  You think so?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Uh-hmm.</p>
<p>
<pb facs="0109" n="Page0109"/>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Might serve a purpose?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Uh-hmm.  Now these would be people who would be outside of the Department?</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Correct.  Oh, absolutely, they would be people like yourself.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  I would think it could have merit.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Some people say, “Well, a judge has to fit certain criteria, but an Ambassador doesn't.” But it seems almost as though you could set up criteria.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Oh, of course, of course they have to meet criteria.  There's all kinds of criteria that an Ambassador should meet.  Yes, I would think it would be useful to have that kind of a committee.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Because there is quite a movement on for that.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Is there really?</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Yes.  Yes.  David Newsom at Georgetown University is one of the proponents, and Carol Laise is another.  I don't know whether you've heard of her.  She used to be the Director General and was Ambassador to Nepal.  Married to Ellsworth Bunker.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Yes.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  I asked her about it, and she said, “Well, I think it's a great idea, but I don't think it will ever happen.” Which seems to be the way with so many good ideas.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Well, that's true, that's true, but it just wouldn't hurt a bit.  It would help.  I wouldn't feel like I would have any real wisdom to offer in the choice of a career diplomat, but for a non-career diplomat, I would think it could be useful.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Well, it is something that is talked about.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  That's very interesting.</p>
<p>
<pb facs="0110" n="Page0110"/>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  But they always come back and say, “Well, a judge has to meet certain requirements of having passed the bar, and the various committees can look over his record and see whether he was good, bad or indifferent,” as just happened to Judge Bork.  “And there is no such thing—no such examination—that Ambassadors take.”</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  I don't think that's particularly relevant to the basic problem.  What you're dealing with is, can this specific individual, as he is, do the best job at that post under these circumstances, and what talents does he bring?  And where would he be short-changed?</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Sure, because, of course, the Senate is supposed to be the one that weeds them out, and in the case of the day when you were there, they did.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  They did.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  But they don't always, you know, and then it's really quite embarrassing.  For the career people at the post, I can assure you, it's very embarrassing.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Yes.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Because foreigners don't hesitate to say, “What's the matter with you Americans?”</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  That is right.  And I know.  There have been some who have been sent overseas that were a little difficult to understand why they were sent there.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  What is your feeling about the political versus the career Ambassador?  What do you think the proportions there should be?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Well, hasn't it been about 12 percent?</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  More like 25.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Twenty-five non-career people?  Well—</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  But now it's about forty percent.</hi>
</p>
<pb facs="0111" n="Page0111"/>
<p>GINN:  Forty percent non-career?</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Which is one of the things, of course, that is crushing careerists at the Department.  There aren't many places for the top people anymore.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Okay.  That would come as a result of the pressure of the ultraconservatives in this administration.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  That's correct.  They feel they want their own people in there in order to explain the President's policies.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Well, and to promote their own conservative ideas.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  I do certainly see where it is very valuable in some situations, where you have somebody who knows the president and can smooth the path and get things through without having to go through the red tape.  I can see that.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  But that's not the name of the game for me.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  No?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  The name of the game is to go through the structure, because you sitting off here on the limb of this side of the tree may have no idea what the impact of what you're going to do is going to have on the other side of that tree, and that's what the State Department is for.  They're going to sit there in the trunk and balance the limbs of the tree.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  That's a very good point, a very good point.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Has to be that way in this kind of a government.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Because they have the whole picture.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Sure.</p>
<p>
<pb facs="0112" n="Page0112"/>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  It's interesting to have your views.  I'm sure a lot of the officers—the career officers—would love it if there were only 12 percent non-career Ambassadors.  [Laughing]</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  I can see the opportunities for a President to acknowledge people who have been helpful.  Somebody ought to invent a different kind of a super reward that he can give other than in a place where it's the most serious business in the world of the government .  Let's invent one.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  What was the most important problem you dealt with while you were in Luxembourg?  Or were there no real crises?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  There were no crises.  The consular problems, I guess, were boys that got put in jail for drugs, the woman whose husband died while she was there on a trip.  Those were the human problems.  One of the personnel in our office got sick and had to go to the hospital.  The people problems were important.  There were no major governmental problems.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  It's a very stable government.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Oh, the government is very stable.  The South African problem began to heat up about the time that I was ready to leave.  And the government—our government—was making moves toward encouraging Luxembourg to take certain positions in regard to the problems in South Africa.  Those were the problems of international importance as they filtered down into Luxembourg.  The problems of business—the people who represented business in the United States who came there, seeking help in the promotion of their products, that's a continuous flow in that kind of business.  And there were interesting concerns about the deployment and the storage of ammunition in Luxembourg.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Yes, I bet that was sticky.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  That was.  It was of interest because you could see their reluctance and their concern.  But so far as heavy international problems, I remember having the feeling that I thought it would certainly be a great help if the Secretary of State, when he was making his quick tours over there, if he would come to Luxembourg once instead of always going to Brussels.  It would have a great effect, because here is a loyal ally.  Luxembourg has always been on our side and we never pay it any attention at all.  And if the President should pay a formal visit to Luxembourg, those people would just .  .  .</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Wouldn't they?</hi>
</p>
<pb facs="0113" n="Page0113"/>
<p>GINN:  Then they would have arrived.  And, again, it's an understanding that you have to acknowledge all of your constituencies.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Yes, and it's so close to Brussels.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Yes.  Just a zip and a hop and there's a wonderful airport there.  Now, General Haig came down to see us a number of times.  He was well-received in Luxembourg.  He came and made a speech to our businessmen's clubs one time.  He's a fantastic speaker.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  So I've heard.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  And so far as an associate to work with, I found him very comfortable to work with.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Considerate?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Yes.  A very bright man.  I was always very grateful that he was on our team as an American.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  He had a lot of prestige in Europe, didn't he?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Oh my yes!</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Not taken too seriously by the party, though, as a presidential candidate?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  There's just too many fine men in line ahead of him.  Thank heavens.  Not because I'd want him to be at the back, but thank heavens we have that kind of resource.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  That's right.  Did you ever have any CODELS, Congressional delegations?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Yes.  Two or three.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Was it hectic?</hi>
</p>
<pb facs="0114" n="Page0114"/>
<p>GINN:  What lovely wallpaper we have.  [Laughter] Because I think that when the Congressmen do come, in spite of the fact that they seem to have a lack of serious mien when they're there, they probably pick up a lot more than we know.  That can be done very easily by people that are as skilled with the public as the Congressmen are.  But there are many times when their actions are misunderstood.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Yes.  Especially by the local press.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Oh my yes.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  How were you handled by the local press?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Oh, comfortably.  I only had one problem and that was when I invited a newsman to a dinner and he never replied.  Never replied, never showed up, never said anything.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Do you suppose it went astray?  The invitation?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  We don't know, but it was so delicate we didn't dare call up and say, “Where is so-and- so, and why haven't we heard from him?” We didn't know.  He might not have had a tuxedo, and it would have been embarrassing if we had made that inquiry.  So we just held the plate at the ready sign if necessary.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  And whisked it off at the last minute.</hi>
</p>
<p>Did you have Foreign Service Inspectors?</p>
<p>GINN:  Yes, we did.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  And how did you make out with them?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Didn't have any problems.  We didn't have any problems there that they found.  At least none that they reported to me.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Well, they would have, I'm sure.</hi>
</p>
<pb facs="0115" n="Page0115"/>
<p>GINN:  The staff felt it was a comfortable visit and that the inspectors were pleased and that there wasn't any problem.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Can you tell me about something that was your greatest success while you were there?  Some occasion, perhaps, or some demarche?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  I can't call it a success but I can call it a very moving experience for me.  As part of the Bicentennial celebration Princess Joan wanted to have Luxembourg do something for the United States, something special, so she [asked] the parliament [to] pass a law, or a statement, saying that the earth underneath General Patton's statue at Eidelburg should be given to the United States as their token for the bicentennial.  Well, by golly, the parliament passed it.  I was talking to Uncle Stanley about it and he said, “Whoa!” I said she wanted me to accept it.  He said, “That can only be a gift in token because the acceptance of territory by the United States can only be done through an act of Congress,” which I didn't know.  “So,” he said, “let me write you a document.” And he did.  He sat down and wrote the document so that it was a gift in kind, a symbolic gift.  And that was the way that she gave it and I accepted it.  But to me, here was a piece of terra firma being transferred, even though it was in kind, from one country to another, given by one woman, received by another.  And there was no war to get it done.  That, to me, was probably the most exciting thing that I participated in, because I know that's never happened before.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  That is so full of symbolism.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Yes.  The people over there are great admirers of the American Army [and] General Patton, and the number of people from America who come there to go to the Hamm Cemetery, where he is buried, is astounding.  The veterans' organizations from the United States that would come by the busloads.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  They must have that summer, particularly.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Many times they'd come by and we would greet them and give them Cokes or entertain them in some way, lightly.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Patton is really quite a folk hero to the Luxembourgers, isn't he?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  You'd better believe he is!  My goodness, what that man did for them!</p>
<p>
<pb facs="0116" n="Page0116"/>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Yes, yes.  Those were thrilling days in retrospect but a little too thrilling at the time.  I know you remember as well as I do.  Did you go back to the United States at all while you were ambassador?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Yes.  I came back to receive a recognition from UNESCO.  Flew over on one day, stayed two days, and flew back.  And I didn't come back to Missouri because Stanley made the trip about every six weeks, back and forth, so he could keep track with what was going on here and back there.  But there was never any calling back of me to Washington for any kind of problems, and besides, when I left, one of the directives that Larry Eagleburger gave me was that I should go to Luxembourg and stay there.  He said the previous Ambassador had been out of the country much of the time, so he said, “You just go over there and stay there.” [Ambassador Farkas was called to the United States to testify at the Watergate hearings] And I did.  Every now and then I'd go to Bitburg for the market at the military base, but I stayed there and didn't leave the country for six months.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  I suppose you went to all parts of it?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Oh, yes, all over the country, from one end to the other.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Made the presence felt.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  That's right.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  When you left, did you feel there was anything that you left unresolved?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Yes.  I would have liked to have stayed another three weeks so my granddaughter could have finished her school, and they said no.  The State Department was getting ready to put a new man in place and they wanted him there in time for the Grand Duke's birthday, I guess, for the same reason they wanted me there at the same time.  [James] Lowenstein, do you know him?</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  No.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  He's an Ambassador.  He was in the State Department in Washington before I went over there.  Oh, his family had the Wamsutta Mills.  I met his mother on the Queen [The ocean liner “Queen Elizabeth II”] last year, year before last.</p>
<p>
<pb facs="0117" n="Page0117"/>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  You had no women officers, did you, while you were there?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  No, no women officers.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  And as far as the wives go .  .  .</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  I'd invite them over to lunch every now and then.  We talked about the problems of being a Foreign Service wife.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Especially in that period.  No longer were wives required to do things.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  That's right.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  But they weren't given any credit if they did do them.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Yes.  I was very careful when I needed help to be certain that it went as a personal favor to me when I needed them to come and help.  We talked about that problem.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  How did you know this was a problem?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Oh, I don't know how I did, but I picked it from some place.  But I had another concern, with the threat that I had there.  I began to have a concern with the rise of the terrorism that was going on, that we had no plan at the Embassy for the protection of the families of our official family.  I insisted that we have a staff meeting and talk about it.  The staff officers kind of played it down.  They didn't want me to get excited and go overboard on that.  I didn't want them to feel I was excited, but, by golly, I wanted a plan in hand as to whose family would go where with whom, whether they would come to the Embassy, how we would handle our things.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Did you get anywhere in these discussions?  Were you able to work out a plan?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  No, we were not able to work out a plan, but we created the awareness among the officers that such plans for each individual family were necessary, and left it to them to handle it in accordance with their own best judgment, which is really as far as I felt we could go under those circumstances.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Were you thinking in terms of these Middle Eastern types who pop up all over the world?</hi>
</p>
<pb facs="0118" n="Page0118"/>
<p>GINN:  Yes.  There were a couple of terrorist attacks in West Germany at that time and it just made good sense to me to be prepared.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  It isn't on the tape, but you did tell me about the time you went into your office soon after you arrived.  Would you relate that for the record?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Early on in the time when I was there, when I got to my office, why, all of the officers were there and it seemed that there had been a telephone call come into the Embassy saying “We're going to kill the Ambassador.” The men didn't know me very well and I didn't know them very well, and I had been threatened once before in my life, so it wasn't a new experience, and I said, “I've been threatened before.  It doesn't bother me a bit.  Just go about your work and don't pay any attention to it.  I'll be careful where I go, I'll never go the same way twice, and I'll use due caution and care, and keep me advised of what happens.” But I was a little scared.  [Laughs] But you can't let your team know you're scared.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  I can imagine.  Did you have any health problems while you were over there?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Yes.  I once had a sore throat.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Is that the most you can dig up?  [Laughter]</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  And the doctor who came told me not to drink ice water.  He said it sears those tissues in there.  It isn't good for them, and of course when you have a little fever the first thing you want is a cold drink of water.  That was all.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  How did you spend the Christmas and Thanksgiving holidays?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Oh!  It seems to me like Thanksgiving we had a big reception for all of our officers and their families, complete with turkey and such.  That was Thanksgiving.  And for Christmas all of our family came over.  Both children and grandchildren and everybody, and we just had a great Christmas there.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  So the whole family came over.  That must have been lovely.</hi>
</p>
<pb facs="0119" n="Page0119"/>
<p>GINN:  It was; it was fun.  But one of the fun things was the discovery that there's an extra holiday in December for children, along about the fourteenth I think it is, when Kris Kringle is supposed to come and bring toys for the children.  Callie and I didn't know about that.  We discovered it very late on, so we said, “Well, goodness gracious, we can't let this go by without celebration.” The two of us went to town together and each of us bought something for ourselves that we really wanted.  [Laughter] Oh, it was a fun time.  It was a happy, gay Christmas.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Oh, I bet it was.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  The house was full of giggling children.  We had lots of friends who came to see us over there, and they were always welcome.  I felt that the more I could share that experience .  .  . it would be as unique for most of them as it was for me.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  I'm sure they all still talk about it.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  This couple that is coming this weekend, the man who's coming for cocktails tomorrow night, he and his wife and sons had been hunting in South Africa and they came up to see us on their way back to the States.  And then the man who's coming on Sunday came to see us—Tony—in Luxembourg.  And, oh, just—Virginia, my good friend Virginia, that I went to China with, came to see me over there.  Lots of people, and they were always welcome, 'cause that kind of an experience doesn't become available for very many people and I was glad to share it.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  You put them up at the residence?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Sure, right there.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  This leads me to ask you what the impact of this power was on your feelings of yourself?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  I think maybe kind of like I said in the beginning, when I said, “Lord, help me.” That I had the feeling, “Lord, I hope I haven't made too many mistakes.” [Laughter] But it was a wonderful experience.  It was a great growing experience and I know it, because you can't have that kind of opportunity and exposure, and not grow.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Did you try to include your staff in official dinners?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Always.  Rotated.</p>
<pb facs="0120" n="Page0120"/>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  You rotated them.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  To their convenience.  Sometimes who's available, who would like to come, and that kind of a thing.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  And if it concerned that person particularly.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Right.  Yes, oh yes.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Did you ever have occasions when your officers would say to you, “Would you invite so-and- so to the residence?” Some businessman, say, that they were trying to get to know?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Absolutely.  They were free to make any kind of request like that and I was glad to do that, because I felt that was part of my responsibility to help them do their job.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  It seems to me from all the things you've said, that your husband did a great deal toward making your tour of duty successful.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  He did entirely.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Not the least of which were the hunting trips.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  That's right.  That was so funny, and that has carried on.  After we came back, the Count of Anselberg and his daughter Vanciann came to see us, spent a couple of weeks with us, and we took them down to the Piney River in the Ozarks and gave them the general treatment, had a big party for him in Columbia.  We visited their hunting lodge in Belgium and their fourteenth century castle when we were in Luxembourg, and we're great admirers of their family—still enjoy them.  His 86-year-old mother, the one that shot the boar that I was telling you about.  Wonderful Countess Maggie.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Countess Maggie?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Countess Maggie.  She wrote and told me she wanted me to call her Maggie.  [Laughter] The highest compliment she could pay us.</p>
<p>
<pb facs="0121" n="Page0121"/>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  You were able to have a closeness with people like that that you wouldn't have had had you not had that interest in common.  Were hunting and fishing your main sources of recreation?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  They were Stanley's main source of recreation.  It gave him something to fill his time, to keep his mind active.  Then he engaged in a considerable and continuing physical program: he walked.  Of course, everybody walks over there in Luxembourg and that was, of course, good.  His interest in the Rotary clubs.  He played poker one night a week.  And when he left, they gave him a plaque, from the Luxembourg Poker-Playing Girl-Watching Society.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Were these American businessmen?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  American businessmen.  Dan Phillips from our own tribe, and businessmen.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  But no Luxembourg businessmen?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  There may have been.  There may have been.  There was Dan Phillips; there was a Williams, who was from Texas, and I can't remember the other two men.  They really had a good time.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  It's nice he had that.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Yes, he needed that, because a man who is as active and as full of energy as he is, if he didn't have anything to do, he would be miserable.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  He's very gregarious, so I am assuming that he enjoyed the entertaining .  .  .</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Oh yes, oh he did.  No problem.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  .  .  .  and went as your escort to all of the parties so that never was a problem.  You always had your host built in.  Of course, you didn't suffer from loneliness, then.  You had your granddaughter and you had your husband.  Sometimes that can be a problem.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Can loneliness—?  Do you have some—?  Well, I would not have that problem, because I always have so many more things that I'm dying to get to do than I ever get to do.  So loneliness would never be a problem for me.</p>
<p>
<pb facs="0122" n="Page0122"/>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  What they have explained to me is that being an Ambassador separates you from everybody else at the mission.  You have to keep that little distance, and unless you have a circle at your level, you find yourself stranded up there.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Yes, that's right.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  The ones who aren't married have mentioned this.</hi>
</p>
<p>When you look back on your time in Luxembourg, from what do you get the most satisfaction?</p>
<p>GINN:  That's a very hard question to answer.  Because there's all kinds of satisfactions.  From the feeling that I didn't fall flat on my face, and the feeling that I did make lots of friends for the United States, that I looked after the people who were responsible for me.  And the expression of cooperation that I tried to project to the Luxembourg government on the part of the American government, the support of the military that was in Europe.  I went to Bitburg and made speeches for the Army clubs there.  I'd go to Strasbourg and speak to the wives of all the officers there in the European command, trying to express support from our position on the team to theirs.  And the efforts that I made to show support for the government that was in power in Luxembourg.  The business of the trust of the people, their government.  Maintain the support back home to keep the home folks here in this country advised as to what I saw that the situations were in the various aspects of our government's relationships.  I'm hard-pressed to say that one was the greatest contribution, but it's a whole package that I tried to provide and project.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  And as you look back, you have a feeling within yourself that you succeeded in doing what you wanted to do.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Yes, I did.  I was content.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Good, good.  Well, you've obviously given it a great deal of thought both before, and while you were there, and afterwards.  How did it rate, this ambassadorship?  How does it rate in the totality of all the things you have done?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Tops.  The most satisfying, heaviest responsibility, most rewarding.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  It seems to be a unique experience.</hi>
</p>
<pb facs="0123" n="Page0123"/>
<p>GINN:  It is a unique experience.  I couldn't have asked, as I said, for any better experience, any more rewarding time—great opportunities—just a dream.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  And your husband's feeling about it is a good one?</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Good one, good one.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Well, it was his idea in the first place.  [Laughter]</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  It was his idea in the first place.  You have to watch these young fellers.  They're apt to have some pretty wild ideas.  But he was totally supportive of this.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Yes, sure.  Well, if he hadn't been .  .  .</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Well, I couldn't have done it.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  It would have made your task impossible.  It would have torn you apart.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  There was no way.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  He didn't want it for himself, though.  He wanted it for you.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Correct.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  And went all out to help you.</hi>
</p>
<p>Did you have any embarrassment when you were there over the national trouble we had just been through with Watergate?</p>
<p>GINN:  No.  If I remember correctly, they were all very polite and never brought it up.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Of course, the Vietnam war was over, so you avoided all of those dreadful times people had in the early '70s at posts, of pickets and bricks and that sort of thing hurled.  It seems to be a part of your charmed life, doesn't it, that your ambassadorship .  .  .</hi>
</p>
<pb facs="0124" n="Page0124"/>
<p>GINN:  Isn't that the truth?!  Didn't you know that my guardian angel is white-haired, decrepit and in a wheel chair?  [Calling out] Take your vitamins, honey.  [Laughter] Oh, goodness.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  The last question I want to ask you is what advice would you give to another young woman starting out today who had ideas of wanting to serve her country in the diplomatic field?  Or we can even add in the political field.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Pick your country.  Zero in on it.  Get to be an absolute expert on it, learn the language, visit it, find out everything you can about it.  And then hope that if you ever have the chance that you will be sent there, and not some place on the other side of the globe that you don't know anything about and can't speak the language.  [Laughter]</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Very good.</hi>
</p>
<p>Any final wrap-up thoughts you have on this trip we've taken down Memory Lane?</p>
<p>GINN:  I don't want it to wind up, and I don't want it to end, but I want to hope that you have the continued strength, energy and kindness that you've shown to me to carry this through.  You're great!</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Well, thank you very much!  I didn't mean that.  What I meant .  .  .</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  I know, but I meant it.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  That's very kind, very kind, and I appreciate it.  And I certainly appreciate all the help and kindness you've shown me.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Well, you're doing a wonderful thing, because this will give other people things to think about.  It won't solve anything for anybody, but it may give them things to think about in the choice of a career.  This is the kind of document that if it were in college libraries, it could be helpful in people planning whether or not they would be willing to make the sacrifices that this requires, to plan what training they would have to take, and it can serve a very useful purpose.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  That was my next to the last question.  The last question is:  What do you feel, so far, is the most significant achievement in your life?  [Laughing]</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Well, you see, I've still got an awful lot of traveling to do down this road.</p>
<pb facs="0125" n="Page0125"/>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Indeed.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  And who am I to judge the past?  Because everything I've done continues to be more exciting and more of a challenge.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Isn't that wonderful!</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  And it's been a good show and a great beginning.  [Laughter]</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  I would expect that, perhaps, your family remains at the core of your life.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Oh, of course they do.  But it wouldn't be fair, it wouldn't be a good answer for you for me to say that my family was the most important thing in my life, because there's times when my family has been set aside and I have had to say, “Now, Sally, you keep the books for the house, I'm going to Europe.” “Nancy, you be sure to take Sally to her dancing classes and you've got to carry the load.” So, there have been times when they had to kind of step aside to let me keep some of the commitments that I've had.  And there's times when Uncle Stanley had to wear a pair of dirty socks.  So, they have understood that they kind of had a wildcat for a mother.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  [Laughing] A rather domesticated wildcat, though.</hi>
</p>
<p>GINN:  Am I?</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Oh, that's very good.  [Laughing] Good answer.</hi>
