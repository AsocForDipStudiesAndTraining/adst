                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Howard, I'm going to ask you to give us a brief background
                        on where you came from, what your education was. If you had any professional
                        or business activity before you went into the USIA program I'd like you to
                        cover that, and then give me a brief description of the manner in which you
                        got into the agency in the first place. From then we'll go on assignment by
                        assignment, picking up your experiences, and your activities, and so forth.
                        So will you start right now, unless you have a question before we
                        start?</hi>

                <p>Biosketch - Pre-Government Career(s)</p>
                <p>NEEDHAM: Well, Lew, this might ramble a bit. Looking back, it seems to me that I
                    was pointed to something like a lifetime of work in the communications field
                    right from the beginning. But fate, in the form of the Depression, came along
                    just as I was ready to enter college, and I was quickly faced with the need to
                    decide on not going to college, and what kind of work I would get into, which
                    would give me an academic platform for perhaps getting back to college
                    later.</p>
                <p>That led me to choose journalism, and I quite deliberately managed to obtain a
                    foothold on the business side of the San Francisco Chronicle, which I retained
                    until I was able to transfer to the editorial staff, and eventually began to
                    climb the ladder there.</p>
                <p>I was there for ten years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: For which years?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEEDHAM: Years 1932 to 1942, when I enlisted in the Army. But those ten years
                    were rather rich in experience. I started my editorial career as radio editor
                    for the paper, and went from that to general assignment. And then spent a year
                    in heavy research, and came out of that as an assistant editor to the section
                    called “This World,” which was just starting up in those days; that was about
                    1936 or '37.</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>Subsequent experience included legislative coverage, police court work, and a
                    long, long stint as a rewrite man, which probably was what I was doing at the
                    time the war broke out.</p>
                <p>I thought things over for several months and finally decided that yes, it would
                    be right to enlist. In September of '42, I enlisted in the Army of the United
                    States. I was in the Army for three and a half years. When I came out, I took a
                    job in New York City as Public Relations Director for RCA Communications, the
                    original Marconi organization, taken over at that time by RCA.</p>
                <p>This combination of occupations whetted my appetite for work in the
                    communications field abroad. It didn't seem possible at the time that it could
                    happen. I had married and my wife was having children. The possibilities seemed
                    to dim when I chose not to raise the children on the east coast, but to return
                    home to the west coast, where I felt the children would have a happier
                    rearing.</p>
                <p>Having done that, I rejoined journalism, this time going to work for the San
                    Francisco Examiner, and two years later was stricken with endocarditis, which
                    laid me low for about a year. At the end of that year, the doctors suggested
                    that I not go back into journalism, at least for the time being.</p>
                <p>So I sought employment in a quieter atmosphere, and began taking civil service
                    examinations, largely for the mental exercise and with the idea that sometime in
                    the not-distant future I would, perhaps, secure employment with the government.
                    This led to employment with the Oakland Naval Supply Center as an industrial
                    relations specialist for the Center, which included publication of a weekly
                    employee organ.</p>
                <p>This position at the supply center commenced in 1950. The Korean War broke out in
                    1951, and in the same year President Truman called for the International
                    Campaign of Truth, which was a nation-wide call for information and media
                    specialists. It seemed to me at that time that there might be an opportunity to
                    utilize my civil service eligibility and my journalistic background in a program
                    which would have a great many installations abroad. So when Anthony Covins came
                    to San Francisco, along with Ambassador Durbrow, and set up a State Department
                    recruiting operation at the Clift Hotel, I trotted down there and submitted my
                    application and a brief resume. To my delight I was accepted as an eligible
                    candidate for the new program. And that marked my entrance to what later became
                    USIA.</p>
                <p>1951: Entrance into USIA Predecessor Organization; Assignment to Madras,
                    India</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was 1951?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>NEEDHAM: Yes. I received my letter of appointment from the Department of State in
                    April of 1951, and reported within a few weeks to the Foreign Service Institute
                    in Washington, D.C., for preliminary training. Subsequently, I was assigned to
                    Madras, India—in South India—as an assistant information officer and vice
                    consul, and at a very low grade I might add, which was later corrected.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you were assigned to Madras in Southern India; that was
                        a fractious time in India, as I recall. I'd like to ask you what was your
                        impression at the time; what experiences did you have as you got there that
                        were important to give you the atmosphere of the place?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEEDHAM: Well, atmosphere was certainly strong, Lew. To this day I have a vivid,
                    almost immediate recollection of every detail of my arrival at Sahar Airport,
                    just outside Bombay. The ride into town was really jolting to an American
                    brought up with very little overseas experience. I had never seen poverty or
                    squalor to the degree that I saw it along the roadside from Sahar Airport into
                    Bombay. That was very jolting and gave me second thoughts as to where I was
                    bringing the family, which by that time consisted of a wife and three
                    children.</p>
                <p>I arrived at the hotel, the famous Taj Mahal Hotel, commonly known as the Taj, on
                    a bright, sunny afternoon after a very long flight. In those days we had no
                    jets. It was a motor flight, with the only stop at Cairo, all the way from
                    London, and I was exhausted. I remember sitting on the bed and bending over to
                    take off my shoes, and that's the last thing I recall until about 8:00 the
                    following morning when I awakened. There was a bearer in my room and he was
                    drawing a bath, and unpacking my suitcase.</p>
                <p>Oddly enough, I awakened with the same question in the forefront of my mind with
                    which I had drifted off to sleep. That was, “Where am I bringing my family?”</p>
                <p>I stepped to the French-doors window, opening onto a balcony, and looked down
                    into the beautiful garden below, and watched some of the gardeners at work. It
                    was a bright, sparkling, sunny day, and I was struck with the vivid foliage and
                    colors of India, in a most picturesque—almost Hollywood-type setting. And
                    something about this reassured me, and as I stood on the balcony and listened to
                    the chatter in Gujarati language—at that time, I understood not a word of it—I
                    realized that these were a very poor people, and a very cheerful people. I was
                    somewhat reassured. I felt that perhaps it was going to be a very good
                    experience for all of us. I never had reason, in the subsequent four years that
                    I served in India, to reverse that feeling. It is something that I find a little
                    amazing, even today, to realize.</p>
                <p>I look upon the Hindu people, and the people of that subcontinent, as a very
                    happy and courageous people, in spite of their hardships. I find it humbling to
                    compare their lot with our lot, or even with the lot of Western civilization. I
                    doubt that there would be the same amount of cheerful acceptance of hardship
                    anywhere west of the Suez.</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>I perhaps should mention that en route to Madras I went from Bombay by air to New
                    Delhi for consultation with Clare Timberlake, at that time Country Public
                    Affairs Officer for all of India. He later became ambassador, and is best known
                    for his career in the Belgian Congo—what is now known as Zaire.</p>
                <p>After several days' consultation in Delhi, I proceeded on to Madras, where I took
                    up my duties as assistant information officer, and publications officer.</p>
                <p>The first problem that we seemed to have was getting a small pamphlet printed,
                    which had been in the printing shop for several months. When I inquired as to
                    why it had not come off the presses, the reply was that they were lacking a
                    certain drying agent for their inks, and had to send to Europe for it—a
                    chemical. They stated it was impossible to print without this drying agent in
                    the dye, for the colored cover of the proposed pamphlet.</p>
                <p>I took this up with the foreman of the plant, an ex-RAF officer who had elected
                    to stay on in India—a very charming fellow. We had a long lunch, during which he
                    said there was one thing they might try, and it struck me as very odd; they
                    could substitute the white of an egg for this chemical and perhaps that would
                    react under the heat of their gas jets as a drying agent. At least it would be
                    worth trying, and we'd get a dye fix for the deep blue color, which was part of
                    the cover. And this worked. I had never heard of it before, nor since. I think
                    it's probably the first time and the only time that a USIA pamphlet was printed
                    with the help of the white of an egg.</p>
                <p>Getting the Newly Established Branch Post at Madras Under Way</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think when we had the tape off, you said something about
                        this being a new post. Was it? Were you just opening the post at that
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEEDHAM: Yes, it was midsummer of 1951. Construction of USIS Madras had just been
                    completed, with a substantial public (USIS) library as a nearby annex. Media and
                    cultural affairs offices were housed in a large and airy building in Mount Road.
                    We had the five languages of Madras State in which to work. They are actually
                    distinct languages, having their own writing systems. I emphasize they were not
                    dialects or sub-dialects. Each language had to have its own translation staff.
                    We hired translator editors; people with some journalistic experience, but who
                    were at least bilingual in two Hindu languages.</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>This was the staffing pattern with regard to the publications and press programs.
                    We had the wireless file coming in at that time, and it was circulating in a
                    limited version to about thirty publications in the countryside, and to five
                    large daily publications (in three different languages), in Madras and its
                    environs, on a daily basis. So the need for the translating desks to get fully
                    operating was immediate and a matter of pressure.</p>
                <p>In addition to not having all the furniture in place, we had not completed our
                    hiring program. At the same time we were endeavoring to get into pay-dirt
                    operation. The pamphlet came off the press and the advice had been good. The
                    cover was fine, the colors were fixed, and it, I think, was the first pamphlet
                    published from the new headquarters.</p>
                <p>Publishing Thirteen Book Titles in Five Indian Languages</p>
                <p>The next job of size or moment was a quick call from Delhi in late June, asking
                    if we could arrange to publish thirteen American book titles—American
                    literature, classics for the most part, in each of the five South Indian
                    languages. I remember that the book I was most interested in was George Orwell's
                    1984, which I thought would be an excellent think piece for all five
                    language-audiences.</p>
                <p>About George Orwell—of course, we know he was a British officer, and we know that
                    his work was highly political. My reason for including Orwell's work among the
                    list of other titles, most of them less political, was that I felt that the
                    Orwell thesis was a very strong counter to the rather frightening inroads into
                    popular opinion local Communist Parties were making throughout India at this
                    time of great change; and at this time when the Indians were coming out of
                    centuries of not having any popular government of their own, most of them never
                    having been concerned with government. Some of them didn't know what
                    “government” was.</p>
                <p>Ferment and public confusion contributed to what might have been a very fertile
                    ground for communist takeover at that time. We did not feel that such likelihood
                    was imminent, but neither could we ignore it.</p>
                <p>We finally got the books translated, edited, printed, bound and published, and
                    the next step was to get them distributed to where there were people who were
                    literate, and with a few rupees to purchase them. They were sold at a very low
                    price. They were paperbacks. They were printed, published, bound, and translated
                    at very low cost. That was a phenomenon of operating in the communications field
                    in India in those days.</p>
                <p>Distribution was accomplished largely through the little book stalls, which you
                    would see in every railroad station of South India. And it was a happy
                    circumstance that these kiosks existed. We had the cooperation of the new Madras
                    state government in gaining a franchise to distribute these books through the
                    state-operated railway system.</p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>We then proceeded to go to more conventional targets, and began to build our
                    mailing lists of literate purchasers in all five languages who were asked to
                    fill out a card giving basic biographical data, which became part of a
                    language-circulation file. Most of them were pleased to sign on to a new
                    learning source. We scrounged directories and libraries for lists of doctors,
                    lawyers, educators. We visited colleges and high schools, where bright students
                    were completing their education. And we encouraged the general public to come in
                    and see the library and make a visit to the Mount Road office. At that time, we
                    had gifts of pamphlets and other literature to hand out to visitors.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You already answered part of my question. I assume you
                        were aiming these books at, primarily, the elite of India, the educated of
                        India, and those who had a reasonable reading capability. And I gather that
                        you probably thought that the mass of Indians, who were clear down at the
                        poverty level, weren't going to be very influential in the Indian political
                        scene. Is that a correct assumption?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Film and Poster Programs for the Illiterate or Semi-literate</p>
                <p>NEEDHAM: In part it is, Lew. We did feel that the mass was unfortunately
                    illiterate. But you can't live in India very long without realizing that the
                    most illiterate group in any language is alert; they're attentive, they are
                    receptive, and the job of getting a response from them is really facilitated by
                    their keen interest in the world about them, in spite of the poverty conditions
                    which are overwhelming.</p>
                <p>We had other means of approaching these people, both the literate and the
                    illiterate. There was the motion picture program, the mobile units which went
                    out to the villages and presented USIS films, all of which had some spoken
                    message of encouragement and often a message of how to improve things in
                    general. Many of these films were acquired from American sources, and
                    soundtracks dubbed in, in the native languages.</p>
                <p>I feel that also our exhibits program, perhaps, was even more effective,
                    especially in urban areas, where we could put on a large exhibit, and where
                    there was avid interest in anything foreign, especially in anything American, in
                    those days. The hunger appeared to be inexhaustible, whether it be for books,
                    exhibits, films, or visits to the office. We often were crowded with people in
                    our reading room.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I don't remember whether you mentioned earlier, but you
                        did mention, first of all, Orwell's 1984—the British author. I gather most
                        of your books, however, were of American origin. About how many titles did
                        you put out? What were some of the other books that you published? Do you
                        have any fix on the number of volumes that were sold, or distributed?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>NEEDHAM: It's difficult to recall right now what the print runs were on these 14
                    titles, and subsequent titles which were published. It's even difficult to
                    remember all the titles. But we were not printing heavy tomes, or massive works,
                    such as you would expect from early American literature. We were putting out
                    contemporary literary works.</p>
                <p>When I say contemporary, I go back as far as the early 20th century, and maybe
                    even a few in the late 19th century. It seems to me we put out three of Mark
                    Twain's works, in an effort to provide something interesting for the youth
                    audiences, the literate youth audiences. Other works were abridged so that the
                    end product could be something handily carried by the dhoti-clad passengers
                    along the South India railway system. And I also might mention that our best
                    customers, of course, were from the first class and second class carriages.
                    Pamphlets were also available on the railroad platforms for third class
                    passengers, some of whom had sufficient reading ability to be interested in
                    obtaining them.</p>
                <p>Tamil was our richest language. It seems to me that we published, and sold
                    successfully somewhere between 30,000 and 40,000 of these various 14 titles, to
                    the Tamil audience alone. The other language audiences took proportionately
                    less, but I would say that in all we probably sold between 80,000 and 100,000
                    books that year. I emphasize that this is many years ago, and I have not kept
                    notes. But this estimate feels right to me at this time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You've been talking about editing and publishing these
                        books in the five different languages that were prevalent in Madras State. I
                        don't think you've named them yet, except incidentally. Can you tell me what
                        those five languages were?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEEDHAM: Well, I can recall, of course, Tamil, which is the main language of
                    South India. And its running mate, Telugu. Then Malayalam, which is the language
                    spoken over on the west coast.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Would you spell that for the transcriber?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEEDHAM: As I recall, it was M-A-L-A-Y-A-L-A-M. I wouldn't say that I'm a Webster
                    authority on how you spell Malayalam; the fourth language was Kannada.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You'd better spell that, too.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEEDHAM: That would probably be K-A-N-N-A-D-A. The fifth language was Hindi.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I don't know whether you want to say anything more about
                        the book program right now, but you mentioned, also, that you were using the
                        wireless file extensively, and therefore I assume you had to have contact
                        with the editors of the press. So you might tell me just exactly how you
                        operated there, and what sort of material, besides the wireless file if any,
                        you got into the press. And finally, was this government press or was this
                        an independent, private press operation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEEDHAM: To answer your last question first, Lew, as far as the press was
                    concerned, it was, for the most part, private enterprise, in all languages. Even
                    though we were in the highly urban area of Madras City, there were a great many
                    small, lingual newspapers, some of them weeklies, and some of them bi-weeklies.
                    In addition to that, there was one English language daily, The Daily Mail, and
                    another daily, which was owned by Goenka. Goenka was the William Randolph Hearst
                    of the subcontinent.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you spell his name, as well as you can recall
                        it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEEDHAM: Yes, that would have been G-O-E-N-K-A, and I'm sorry, I don't remember
                    Goenka's first name, because he was a charming fellow, and a generous host. He
                    delighted in having Americans to his house for dinner about once a month. And
                    the occasions were always enlightening as well as enjoyable.</p>
                <p>We contacted editors of the language press, as we called it, largely through our
                    local employees. This was because they were familiar with their own
                    translations. They, for the most part, had previously worked at one or more of
                    these publications, and were on close professional terms, and in some cases,
                    close personal terms with the editors. And we felt that their entr�e and their
                    welcome would bear the weight of daily, or semi-daily contact with these local
                    staffs better than the U.S. consular presence inflicting itself too
                    frequently.</p>
                <p>We saved ourselves for visits on occasions such as anniversaries, promotions, the
                    presentation of a new project, or similar occasions, and left the day-to-day
                    press contact to our local employees, who did an excellent job, and placed a
                    great amount of material. I might emphasize here that the press reflected the
                    intellectual hunger of India in general in those days. They were so excited at
                    being a free country, they were so hopeful of overcoming their illiteracy, hope
                    sprang eternal. And it was a time of joyful anticipation, really. The press of
                    India, particularly South India, reflected that mood at that time, which
                    operated to a great extent in our favor; it made our materials welcome.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What kind of materials were you getting into the press? I
                        presume you got in much from the wireless file, but did you get any other
                        kind of material—of an editorial character, or so forth—into the press?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>NEEDHAM: Yes. Considering that Madras State was composed of five former political
                    entities, either provinces or city-states, and 80,000,000 people speaking five
                    different languages, it was a rich, sort of garden variety of a placid,
                    methodical people, who for the most part got along very well together. And we
                    were able, always, to place current news in the daily press, without any
                    difficulty whatsoever; it was welcomed.</p>
                <p>The Sunday editors were open to us for long-length features. Their primary
                    interest was “what is America like? Is it truly the fairyland that we've heard?”
                    And we were balancing our act to explain to them that, comparatively speaking,
                    it was a fairyland, but that it was founded on hard work, and without
                    identifying the puritan principle or work ethic as such, we described it.</p>
                <p>Also, their interest ran to things cultural. They were fascinated with our motion
                    picture industry. And incidentally, they had a very strong motion picture
                    industry of their own in South India, Gemini Studios, run by a charming and able
                    person, named Vasan. Vasan saved USIS Madras from a great deal of embarrassment
                    during an international film festival, at which the Communists had arranged an
                    elaborate exhibition—a five-day exhibition—on the beach, on the Bay of Bengal
                    Beach, (of Madras City), whilst the Americans apparently had overlooked the fact
                    that this event was coming to Madras. But I'll get to that later.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We just started your discussion on the film industry when
                        we stopped for a moment, and I think I may not have asked you before, but I
                        guess you did not produce films in India at that time, that is, USIS did
                        not. Were you getting all of your films, or nearly all of them, through the
                        Agency or from the States? And what did you do about linguistics? Did you
                        dub them, then, in India?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEEDHAM: We in Madras depended largely on USIS New Delhi for guidance and
                    materials with regard to the motion picture program. The pictures that we were
                    showing were acquired by USIS headquarters in New Delhi, and were farmed out to
                    the branch offices in the consular districts.</p>
                <p>At first we were working with whatever we could get, frankly. And whatever we
                    could get often was something out of Hollywood; something out of the documentary
                    studios that dot Hollywood, on various subjects; films that were not exactly
                    box-office appeal, but had some remote, or closer, relationship to the problems
                    that India was facing at that time. I'm thinking primarily of films that dealt
                    with education, with child care, with prenatal care; the forerunners of the
                    great amount of how-to-do-it, how to live, how to improve conditions films that
                    were produced later for USIS audiences.</p>
                <p>From there, of course, it has developed now to the point where the film output by
                    USIA is a sophisticated product. Also, the audience in India is a different
                    audience from the audience that I am talking about, which after all, we must
                    remember was back in the 1950s.</p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You did say earlier, I think, that you went out with the
                        mobile unit program—went out into the hinterland. Where were you going? What
                        kind of audiences were you reaching with this mobile unit program? And about
                        how many mobile units were you operating?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEEDHAM: It seems to me we were operating between 14 and 20 mobile units at
                    almost any time in Madras. We had the capability of putting 20 on the road, but
                    I would say that out there four or five were generally on down-time, and our
                    active fleet was probably 15 most of the time.</p>
                <p>As to where they went, they went to small villages in the hinterlands. South
                    India is dotted with small villages; it's impossible to count all of them. But
                    one cannot travel two or three miles without coming across at least two or three
                    villages. They are so close as to be within eyesight of each other, separated
                    largely by the dikes, paddies of rice, farms and occasional desert areas.</p>
                <p>We felt that the motion picture program, and the exhibits program really filled a
                    gap when it came to contacting an illiterate audience. Here was the spoken word.
                    Here were pictures that they could stand in front of and study. And they
                    did.</p>
                <p>It was an enjoyable thing to watch an Indian crowd amble through an exhibit. It
                    was the slowest moving crowd you ever saw, and gradually queues would build up
                    behind a given shot, or a given item in an exhibit, while they stood transfixed
                    with it. And one or more members of the audience, who were literate and could
                    read—that was usually the proportion of literate to illiterate—would kindly step
                    forth and read the native-language caption, which we had placed alongside of the
                    item.</p>
                <p>It was a rudimentary time, and a most enjoyable time, because we were welcomed at
                    that time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was dubbing your films in the different
                        languages?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEEDHAM: They were done in Delhi, at a large studio in New Delhi. I cannot
                    remember the name of the motion picture officer at that time, but he was
                    excellent; he kept a steady stream of titles coming to us.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think you mentioned earlier, when you went to New Delhi
                        initially for your orientation in India, that Clare Timberlake was the
                        Country PAO. I had not been aware that Clare Timberlake ever had a USIA
                        career, or a USIS career. This must have been just one assignment, or maybe
                        one of two assignments that he had in the information program. Can you
                        enlighten me on that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>NEEDHAM: Yes, Clare was, of course, a Foreign Service career officer with the
                    State Department. And you're quite right, Lew, this was I think perhaps the
                    single assignment, which he handled very capably, in India, with the information
                    program.</p>
                <p>As you may recall, in those days occasionally somebody in State would suddenly
                    get the idea that perhaps this, (USIS), new outfit was doing something in which
                    they ought to be interested. It might possibly round out some of the abilities
                    of their officers. And in any case, Clare said to me, during our consultation,
                    that he had taken the assignment because he felt it had a lot to offer anybody
                    who planned to work in public affairs abroad, to get to know opinion molders; to
                    understand the motivation behind professional communicators in various fields,
                    he felt, was almost another department of diplomacy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you remember who the ambassador was at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEEDHAM: Yes, that was Ambassador Loy Henderson.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, Loy Henderson. I knew Henderson later; I never knew
                        whether he really understood the information program or not, but if he had a
                        man like Timberlake at that point, it didn't make much difference.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEEDHAM: That's right. Ambassador Henderson left India very shortly after I
                    arrived, and for years I was completely out of touch with his career.</p>
                <p>An Interesting Anecdote</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When we had the tape off for a few minutes just now, you
                        were mentioning an event that occurred at the time. It was a rather
                        interesting anecdote, and I wish you'd pick up and talk about it now. And
                        spell the name of the gentleman that was involved in it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEEDHAM: Well, Lew, this is perhaps not an earth-shaking anecdote, but it has a
                    certain Hindu charm for me, largely because the principal figure was a very
                    charming, 85-year-old man, who had long been, under the British Raj, a father to
                    the Indian people, and a great representative.</p>
                <p>NEEDHAM: His name was Rajagopalachari; that was his last name, I never knew his
                    first name. It seemed enough if I could master Rajagopalachari. Rajagopalachari
                    was a man, cadaverous, six-feet tall perhaps, a Brahman, very distinguished in
                    the Indian sense.</p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>He had operated with Mahatma Gandhi as a pioneer organizer of the Congress Party
                    of India. He knew the British Raj extremely well. As I said previously, was a
                    marvelous representative; had been a bridge, if you like, between the Raj and
                    his people. And he had the respect of the British and of his people. He had held
                    many high offices in the government of India, under the British Raj, not least
                    of all he had been a governor of Madras during the time of Raj.</p>
                <p>In 1947 he had been tapped by the British, by Mountbatten and his group, out of
                    retirement to become the pro tem governor of Madras State, in preparation for
                    the first annual elections to be held under independence, which as you know,
                    came to India in 1951.</p>
                <p>The work of organizing this took place during the seventh year of a continuous
                    drought, and particularly in South India things were very, very difficult for
                    people. The water tanks were almost dry. Disease had broken out in the cities
                    and the villages. The crops had been light, down to almost non-existence for the
                    last three years.</p>
                <p>And came the day in 1951, finally, when all delegates had been elected and
                    Rajagopalachari, still pro tem governor, was convening the very first congress
                    of the newly independent state government of Madras. And as he did so, the
                    chamber filled up with a large, and noisy, and jubilant crowd, which was perhaps
                    peppered by the frequent outbursts from the front benches, where the communist
                    delegates were seated, waiting for governor Rajagopalachari to come on stage and
                    commence the ceremonies, which he did. And he was greeted with great applause.
                    He was a beloved figure, particularly in the south of India, but also in the
                    north.</p>
                <p>This was like a crowning of his life's work. He was, early on, a Mahatma Gandhi
                    disciple. To a great many of the Indians these were the times and events of a
                    fulfillment of all of the Mahatma's programs. So it was a momentous and
                    emotional occasion, interrupted unfortunately, as the old gentleman proceeded
                    with his introductory remarks, by the communist deputies down in front, who
                    every time Rajagopalachari paused for breath, would leap to their feet, singly
                    or collectively, and shout, “Mr. Speaker, may we know?”</p>
                <p>And finally Rajagopalachari stopped in the middle of his address, lowered his
                    spectacles on his rather long and aquiline nose, and like an ancient grandfather
                    or professor peered over the stage-apron at the communist deputies and said,
                    “Yes, may you know what?”</p>
                <p>And the deputies said, “We have been starving for seven years. We are thirsty.
                    Our tanks are dry. Our children and wives are getting sick. And we want to know
                    what is the new government going to do about that?”</p>
                <p>Rajagopalachari paused and raised his hands in the traditional Hindu gesture of
                    the Namast� blessing, and said very solemnly, “We will pray for rain.” That
                    stopped the raucous behavior of the communist deputies, and the proceedings went
                    on to a happy conclusion and an orderly one. And we all started home at about
                    4:30 in the afternoon.</p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>At approximately 5:00 a typhoon blew into Madras and dropped four inches of rain
                    in about five hours. This “miraculous” episode, of course, was reported
                    throughout the Indian press.</p>
                <p>At this time we had a picture in the exhibits section of another event, in which
                    Rajagopalachari was shown giving the Namast� sign of prayer-greeting and smiling
                    at the camera. We enlarged this picture and put it in the lobby of the Mount
                    Road office for some time. Needless to say, it drew many response-smiles from
                    our visitors.</p>
                <p>Outmaneuvering the Soviets When a Film Festival was Scheduled in Madras Without
                    Advance Notification to USIS/Madras</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were discussing earlier, when we were off tape, about
                        an incident that occurred when a film festival was given unexpectedly—or
                        unexpectedly to you, at least, in Madras. And I think that's worth putting
                        on tape, so I'd like you to proceed with that now, will you Howard?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEEDHAM: Yes, I'd be happy to. I'll start by apologizing, which is always a bad
                    start, for not having all the details at my fingertips. But this was an exciting
                    event and maybe just the raw substance of what really happened will suffice.</p>
                <p>The film festival we are talking about took place in 1952 on Elliot's Beach,
                    which is on the Madras (Western) side of the Bay of Bengal. It was attended by
                    Western delegations from Western film-making nations, as well as from several
                    European and Asian nations. The largest and most elaborate pavilion was the
                    Soviet pavilion. In those days the Soviets would put on a festival, not sparing
                    any horses, and I mean not any. We, on the other hand, in our little office over
                    on Mount Road, had been absolutely unaware of this event. How it happened that
                    we were unaware of it, I cannot explain. But we were unaware of it until about a
                    week before it was due to open up, when we first heard of it.</p>
                <p>At that time our public affairs officer, Paul Sherbet, was very concerned. In his
                    opinion, the festival had weight around the world, and particularly out in
                    Southeast Asia. So was there any action we could take to counter this immense
                    budget-spectacle which we had been reliably informed the Soviets were putting
                    forth for the occasion?</p>
                <p>And it seemed at first that there wasn't anything we could do except sit there
                    and take a whipping. Paul began to plunge around in his own mind and recalled
                    that he had a friendship with Hollywood's famous producer/director Frank Capra.
                    And he thought of having Frank fly out as a guest so that we could at least,
                    perhaps, capture the interest of India's film brass and whoever else the Indian
                    film brass might wish to invite from other delegations. And in short, we might
                    be able, through the aegis of Mr. Capra, to attract an audience of multinational
                    film moguls from Asia and Europe who were there, attending the festival.</p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>So this was set in motion and Delhi tried to reach State and have State contact
                    Mr. Capra. At first, State took a dim view of the idea but later, under urging
                    from Ambassador Timberlake—or I should say, at that time, Public Affairs Officer
                    Timberlake—they revised their opinion and did put the request through to Frank
                    Capra in Hollywood. He immediately recognized Paul's name and said yes, he'd be
                    glad to come out. And as a result, he was there in three days.</p>
                <p>Capra's presence in India was of marked impact to people like Sri Vasan, who was
                    the president of Gemini Studios, (one of the largest movie studios in the
                    world), and who for years has achieved record box office revenues throughout
                    Asia with his pictures. Vasan was delighted to have Frank Capra as his guest the
                    whole time Capra was there. Vasan also volunteered something to us while we were
                    waiting for Frank to arrive. It seemed that an independent film producer—Indian,
                    a Tamil, another Brahman—named Sundaram, had an international cast, making what
                    people call a French Western, down in Kerala State at that time. And among the
                    cast was Cesar Romero, Rod Cameron, and a couple of other well-known American
                    stars, whose names I do not recall at this distant juncture. Perhaps they, too,
                    could come up to Madras and be honored guests?</p>
                <p>So the result of all this was that we had Frank Capra and four American stars and
                    numerous other Asian film lights, who were in the Sundaram Company, in the
                    garden at PAO Sherbet's home in Madras. And the party went on variously—in Mr.
                    Vasan's garden, the gardens of other film producers who lived and worked in
                    Madras—for three days. We didn't exactly win the game, but we certainly did
                    attract the brass from most of the delegations who had been spending all their
                    time out on Elliot's Beach. We felt we had countered, from a defensive position,
                    rather well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, it sounds to me as though even if it wasn't
                        gathering all the crowds, it was at least a show of one-upmanship against
                        the Soviets. Do you have anything else about the tour before we go on to
                        your experience in Delhi?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEEDHAM: Well, Lew, there's much that I could tell but it all would boil down to
                    what amounts to—in my mind, even to this day—as a love affair with the people of
                    my first post. And I think this is typical of most Foreign Service people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I just want to ask one final question then. We spoke
                        briefly about radio activities earlier. You said you did have a radio
                        officer there? What kind of a program were you putting on?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>NEEDHAM: We did not have an American radio officer there. It was handled by one
                    of our senior locals and he worked off the wireless file. I would provide him
                    with a copy of the wireless file early in the morning and he would go through
                    and make his own picks as to what the various radio stations would be interested
                    in, and we would review his choices together. Normally I did not question his
                    judgment. He was a graduate print journalist who had been a radio announcer for
                    years. He was a man in his middle forties and mature and well known in the
                    community.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the radio controlled by the government at that time or
                        was it free as the press was?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEEDHAM: No, radio at that time was still under government control.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So there was a certain limitation to what you could get on
                        the radio then, because of that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEEDHAM: Exactly, yes. However, the limitation was seldom exercised.</p>
                <p>June 1952: Transfer From Madras to Delhi as Managing Editor of USIS India's
                    Nationwide Publication American Reporter</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I guess we've covered Madras now. Before we ever
                        started this you told me that you were later brought up to Delhi. Can you
                        tell me when that occurred and what were the circumstances under which you
                        were transferred to Delhi and what assignment you had there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEEDHAM: Well, I was transferred to Delhi in June of '52, largely as a result of
                    our finally getting five language desks set up for the South Indian language
                    editions of the American Reporter, which was a USIS weekly newspaper that was
                    published in eight languages throughout India, with the parent publication, of
                    course, being in English, and produced at USIS New Delhi. Madras was, I think,
                    the first post to get its language editions in operation. And I was
                    direct-transferred up to Delhi as managing editor of the American Reporter at
                    that time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So this was then a nationwide publication, but it went out
                        in various languages, from the basic English that was prepared in
                        Delhi?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEEDHAM: That's right. I was no longer involved in the language editions. The
                    staff in Delhi was already established. It was a very competent group and also
                    the source of many friendships during the following three years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Clare Timberlake still the PAO at that time? Or had he
                        been replaced then?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>NEEDHAM: He had been replaced by that time. He had been replaced by Teg Grondahl.
                    By that time, also, Ambassador Chester Bowles was on post, succeeding Loy
                    Henderson.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I guess, from what you said, that after you were
                        transferred to Delhi, you had no other duties but that regarding the editing
                        and issuance of the American Reporter. So there really isn't a great deal
                        more to say about your first tour.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Now, I understand you went on home leave and then came back to a different
                    assignment. So just how did that work and when did you go on home leave?</p>

                    Force</p>
                <p>NEEDHAM: I went on home leave in the latter part of July or perhaps the early
                    part of August in '53. In any case, George Venable Allen had arrived and was
                    ambassador to India at that time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Didn't you also think that was about the time that you
                        were getting the first notice of the big cut that the Eisenhower
                        Administration ordered in the latter part of '53?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEEDHAM: Yes. There was a very large cut and we reduced the audience size—our
                    circulation expenses—on the American Reporter in order to conform to that
                    portion of the cut which applied to the American Reporter.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But the cut in personnel, which came subsequent to that,
                        had not taken place at the time you went on home leave? That was occurring
                        while you were on home leave.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEEDHAM: That's correct.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As I understand it, the notification of the cut in
                        personnel occurred while you were on home leave. And at the time that you
                        started on home leave, and most of the time you were there, you were not
                        sure whether you, yourself, were going to be cut, or whether you were going
                        to be retained and go back to Delhi. So will you pick it up at that point
                        and tell me what happened on home leave and then your return to Delhi and
                        your assignment and what you did thereafter?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEEDHAM: Well, of course the first thing to do on home leave always was to park
                    your family where convenient and get yourself into Washington for your
                    debriefing, and the routine medical examination, which all officers take when
                    they return to Washington.</p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>That went rather smoothly. I was unable to determine whether or not I was going
                    to be RIFed or fired. The corridors of Washington were ominously laden with
                    conversations speculating about who was going to be fired and who was not going
                    to be fired. It seemed to be a government-wide cut. My desk officer told me to
                    go on home leave and to wait for a call from him, which I did. Had a most
                    enjoyable home leave and a most enjoyable phone call at the end of it, when I
                    was told to get back to India, that my berth there was secure and they were
                    waiting to receive me.</p>
                <p>So we re-embarked via Monarch Pan Am clipper, which was a propeller ship, and the
                    five Needhams returned to India by way of Honolulu and Wake Island. We refueled
                    there and went on into Tokyo. From Tokyo we flew to New Delhi via Bangkok. That
                    was the Pacific route to India for Pan Am in those days.</p>
                <p>Duty during the second tour involved a lot of routine information work. There
                    were no particular highlights in terms of the post's relationship with its host
                    government.</p>
                <p>Late 1953: Return to Delhi as Information Officer for Delhi Consular District.
                    Rather Uneventful Tour Except for Severe Bout With Hepatitis</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Specifically, what was your position at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEEDHAM: Specifically, I was Information Officer for the New Delhi Consular
                    District. And it involved support of other sections in USIS at the time. We all
                    managed to cross-fertilize our ideas as well as our materials in those days.</p>
                <p>I haven't very much to recount. It seems to me unfortunate that the thing that
                    stands out in my mind is a very severe bout with hepatitis, which I contracted
                    while on special duty in Kandy, Ceylon. I'd been sent there to act as
                    Information Officer for the American delegation to the 10th Plenary Session of
                    the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East, which was being chaired by,
                    at that time—at first, by Ambassador Crowe, who was then ambassador to
                    Ceylon—but about the third or fourth day of the conference he was stricken with
                    a mild heart attack, which proved to be not too serious, but which eliminated
                    him from the running for the rest of the conference. And the chief delegate from
                    Washington—I think it was Dr. Merrill Gay—took over as leader of the American
                    delegation throughout the remainder of the three-week session.</p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>During that period of time, some way or other, I managed to contract hepatitis
                    and by the time I got back to New Delhi I was acutely ill, and rather
                    dangerously so. I was examined by two doctors from the embassy clinic and they
                    decided not to move me to Dhahran, which would have been the nearest hospital;
                    that I would be better off taking my chances staying right in bed at home, which
                    I did for three months and eleven days, then recovered slowly and returned to
                    partial duty until, finally, it appeared that I was not going to make a complete
                    recovery while in the tropics. And so I went home rather early in the second
                    tour. I would say it must have been a good ten months before the natural
                    termination date.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was when? In 1954, then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>1955: Transfer to Washington Assigned to International Press Service (IPS)</p>
                <p>NEEDHAM: That was early 1955. And I quickly picked up, health-wise, upon return
                    to the United States and was assigned to the International Press Service, first
                    as a feature writer, then as a cable editor, and finally, as special assistant
                    to the chief of the International Press Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the chief then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEEDHAM: At that time it was Leland Briggs. Burnett Anderson was his deputy.</p>
                <p>My second IPS assignment was to the cable desk, where Jack Caldwell and I set up
                    the international teams for coverage of international events for the agency. We
                    had teams in Geneva, in Strasbourg, in London, and we had stringers in Berlin
                    and we had a correspondent based—I believe it was in Singapore. If it wasn't in
                    Singapore it may have been in Bangkok—who covered Asia and the Far East for
                    us.</p>
                <p>That was a very interesting assignment because we dialogued via teleprinter on
                    assignments and the results were rather fruitful for the wireless file. We were
                    able to extract fresh, timely, on-the-ground coverage by experienced reporters
                    and writers, giving a livelier note to the wireless file when it came to
                    international news; not necessarily that affecting primarily the United
                    States.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How long were you in that assignment?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEEDHAM: Approximately one year. Following my tour as a feature writer, and cable
                    editor with Jack Caldwell, I was assigned to Leland Briggs' office, which later
                    became Bill Hutchinson's office, as Director of IPS. I was special assistant to
                    both directors.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>NEEDHAM: I was in the special assistant's role for approximately one year, maybe
                    a little less. I left Washington for Guatemala in July, very early in
                    July—perhaps July 1st or 2nd of 1957.</p>
                <p>Mid 1957: Posted to Guatemala as Information Officer</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But in the meantime, you had some Spanish-language
                        training, I gather?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEEDHAM: [Laughter] Oh, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Briefly?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEEDHAM: Yes. Well, that goes back to why I switched from Southeast Asian area to
                    the Latin American area. As I reported previously, I had this terrible bout with
                    hepatitis and had no desire to expose myself to tropical climates, food, and
                    water for some time. I figured, at that time, that a change in area would be
                    timely and that perhaps my best efforts could be put in Latin America where,
                    being a Californian, I had inherited an interest from childhood. Having had four
                    years of high school Spanish, perhaps I would be able to latch onto enough
                    language at the Foreign Service Institute to be effective doing information work
                    for the agency in Latin America.</p>
                <p>Accordingly, I applied for transfer to the Latin American area and was told to
                    get my Spanish in better shape before making formal application. I did this at
                    my own expense, and thinking that I had at least the beginnings of, and the
                    foundation for, an expanding ability, I did apply formally and was invited to
                    take an informal test in the office of the assistant director for Latin America,
                    who at that time was Frank Oram.</p>
                <p>He had a personnel officer in his area, Hal Urist by name, who was a charming
                    fellow, but whose idea of testing was rather rigorous. He presented me with a
                    volume of Cervantes' Spanish and suggested that I translate several pages. Well,
                    of course, this was impossible for my meager ability at that time, and I failed
                    that test. I then proceeded to do a little corridor work with friends and they
                    came to me with the same advice, “Get more Spanish, but in the meantime we'll
                    see what we can do about your application.”</p>
                <p>I proceeded to study more Spanish and finally achieved a non-idiomatic ability,
                    probably at level two, and did make formal application again and was accepted
                    and finally was given orders to report to Guatemala as information officer.</p>

                </p>
                <p>NEEDHAM: Well, the orders came through in middle-June and I was to report in the
                    first week of July.</p>
                <p>

                <p>NEEDHAM: That's right.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEEDHAM: I arrived in Guatemala a month ahead of my family, about July 2nd, and I
                    was greeted by Public Affairs Officer Fred Barcroft. My information assistant at
                    that time was Eugene Friedmann, who later became Minister Consular and deputy
                    chief of mission in Santiago, Chile, and also served as deputy chief of mission
                    in Pretoria, South Africa, in the '80s.</p>
                <p>It was a very interesting and beautiful, little country. There was ample media
                    with which to work. There were 11 daily newspapers in the capital city of
                    Guatemala City. There were about 23 radio stations, independently owned except
                    for one, throughout the country. And the Guatemalteco Americano, binational
                    center was a mature and well-developed teaching base. It boasted an auditorium,
                    library, and large enclosed patio for exhibits and gatherings of all sorts,
                    located in the very heart of town and widely used by almost all the students at
                    the university and in the various high schools about the city.</p>
                <p>A Time of Some Turmoil in Guatemala: USIS Required to Remain Low Key</p>
                <p>I had the good fortune to be included in a list of people to be presented to
                    President Castillo Armas the Monday following my arrival—and was looking forward
                    to it. Unfortunately, the president was assassinated the Sunday night before our
                    Monday appointment; and I never saw him in life. One of my first duties was to
                    be part of the American retinue that attended the funeral.</p>
                <p>There immediately began a series of “new” governments, actually four of them. It
                    took a year for these four governments to appear and disappear. The last one was
                    formed by Presidente Ydigoras Fuentes.</p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You'd better spell that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEEDHAM: That's Ydigoras Fuentes. Ydigoras Fuentes proved to be a very practical,
                    rather pragmatic president, who matched his pragmatism with vigor. He maintained
                    a steady schedule, itinerary of trips to various parts of this small republic.
                    His activity in the commercial area was vigorous. An engineer, his vision as an
                    economist was not exactly tutored, but was entrepreneurial; and he had the
                    instinct for creating new highways, new ports, and for improving the basic
                    infrastructure of the country, which had been somewhat neglected by his
                    predecessors.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was it that caused the intervening governments,
                        before Fuentes, to disappear? Were they just inadequate? Was there internal
                        opposition from just political sources or what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEEDHAM: It was primarily rivalry. The conservative element in Guatemalan
                    politics had only just recovered from the Communist r�gime of Guzm�n Arbenz.
                    They had only just recovered, really, from the liberality of his r�gime and did
                    not, yet, feel secure. Meanwhile, the liberal elements in Guatemala were very
                    anxious to regain what they considered to be their lost territory. So it was
                    sheer hangover rivalry that caused this bucking back and forth—tug-of-war type
                    of fall and rise, revolutionary movements, during one year of time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During this time, when you were having all this trouble as
                        to who was going to be the ruler of the country, did this seriously effect
                        USIS efforts and your attempt to make contacts and go ahead with your
                        programs? Or didn't you feel much problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEEDHAM: Well, we were acutely aware of the fact that there was no telling which
                    side was going to emerge on top. Both Soviet Russia and Cuba were taking
                    substantial interest in Guatemalan unrest. At the same time, we knew that our
                    bona fides, while still unquestioned in the country, could become a matter of
                    question, (from “election” to “election”!), if we put a foot wrong. We drew back
                    a bit, in that the materials which we presented for coverage tended not to
                    intervene in Guatemalan affairs, or even in Latin American affairs, if that
                    seemed to be a sensitive area in relation to what was going on in Guatemala.</p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>I guess what I am saying is, that we became cautious and waited. The game seemed
                    to be to pursue non adjuratory objectives in every case. The goal was to weather
                    the crisis, constructively. This gave us a chance to get into Americana
                    materials again, as in the early days that I experienced in India. And we found
                    that, here, too, there was a welcome for information on how the family, the
                    American family, really lived at home and what it really thought. Granted, it
                    wasn't quite the juicy, even so-called sexy, flavor that a more
                    politically-oriented output might have had for our very politically-minded
                    audience, but it survived and it sufficed. We got through this period; and we
                    had a very capable ambassador in place at the time, who lost no time in
                    establishing a working relationship with President Ydigoras Fuentes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>The Case of the Rash Reporter from Time Magazine</p>
                <p>NEEDHAM: At the beginning of the turmoil, Ambassador Edward Sparks was on scene.
                    An anecdote about Eddie is rather interesting at this time. As you can imagine,
                    a lot of American media were interested in what was going on in Guatemala, not
                    least of all, Time magazine. We had some difficulty with the roving Time
                    magazine correspondent who came down to cover things during this period, and we
                    finally wound up asking the young man to get a briefing from the ambassador,
                    having cleared this idea with the ambassador first; the ambassador then being
                    Edward Sparks.</p>
                <p>The young man, defending his employer's position in a previous article, which had
                    warmly eulogized a young rebel who had been accused of assassinating a
                    government official—this young man said that, like the State Department, Time
                    magazine had its own foreign policy. Ambassador Sparks replied to him, at the
                    time, “That may well be, but Time magazine is not a republic, is not in Latin
                    America, is not in this country, and has no Foreign Service representative in
                    this country that I know of.” And that finished that interview.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the young man react? Did it improve his reportage
                        or did he keep right on blasting away at the Time policy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEEDHAM: He concluded that he had done his job. He'd been there for about a week
                    at the time that this came to a head, and left the following day.</p>

                <p>NEEDHAM: Eddie Sparks was our ambassador well into 1958, and then was replaced by
                    Ambassador Mallory. Ambassador Mallory was in place when Ydigoras Fuentes
                    succeeded to the presidency of the republic. He lost no time in making a friend
                    of Ydigoras Fuentes and gaining his confidence. And indeed, our AID program
                    picked up considerably under Ydigoras Fuentes. In all, the Mallory-Ydigoras
                    Fuentes period was a building period. Much was accomplished in terms of the
                    infrastructure of the country.</p>
                <p>And as far as USIA's effort was concerned, we forged ahead, both with the media
                    and with our cultural affairs program, particularly the latter. Leader grants
                    and scholar exchanges were multiplied during that period. I can't give the exact
                    figures, but I know that they were at least doubled from the previous year. This
                    was done rather easily because the post still retained the appropriations, which
                    had not been used during the turmoil.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there an AID program in Guatemala, at that time, that
                        helped in the re-building of the infrastructure?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEEDHAM: Yes, there was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was USIS concerned with promoting it? Or did they have
                        their own Public Affairs representative?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEEDHAM: The AID program in Guatemala, at that time, was not staffed to operate
                    its own information program. That function was performed by USIS.</p>
                <p>The AID Assisted and Promoted Housing Program Involving Native Construction
                    Involvement —Publicity Courtesy of USIS</p>
                <p>USIS was not particularly concerned in promoting the country-wide infrastructure,
                    such as ports and highways. But we were very interested in a particular project
                    which AID was putting on. At the time it was original; it was founded by a man
                    called Temple Dick, who had been, before coming into the government service, a
                    San Francisco-based architect. And Dick, with a few of his associates, worked
                    out a program which went about as follows:</p>
                <p>They would go into the slums, in the barancas, and ask to meet the “leaders.” The
                    “leaders” didn't have to be official. Generally, the people would point to
                    one—and would agree on one or two individuals, and these individuals would be
                    invited to the AID offices. There they would be acquainted with plans for a
                    small complex of homes that might be built, provided that they and their
                    neighbors could supply the labor, and the AID program would supply the
                    materials; and that they would work in groups, building groups of homes.</p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>These would be small, modest homes—concrete poured, slab floors—but they would
                    have plumbing and electricity, which the people were not having in the barancas.
                    They would be in a healthy part of town and there would be a change of
                    lifestyle, and a new opportunity for these families and their children.</p>
                <p>The men would work in groups of 12, each group building 12 homes. No homes would
                    be distributed until all had been completed, and then they would be distributed
                    by draw. The challenge was put before the “leaders,” that they go back to the
                    baranca and interest people who they thought had the stamina and the purpose and
                    the general acumen to see this opportunity and to take hold of it. They were
                    warned against failure or against change of heart; if there was much of that,
                    the whole project could collapse, they were told.</p>
                <p>They did this. They went back to their barancas, and while I was there, there
                    were 36 such homes built and they were built to completion. And the drawings
                    were conducted with President Ydigoras Fuentes making the draw from the sombrero
                    himself. The families moved into debt-free homes. I cannot quite describe the
                    joy that was exhibited at these ceremonies. And it wasn't just those who
                    received the homes who were celebrating, but their friends and compatriots, as
                    well.</p>
                <p>This was something that appealed to everybody in the country. Temple Dick went on
                    to do something like this in Chile, by constructing high schools in the same
                    manner; arousing community effort and supplying materials while the community
                    supplied the labor.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, did you do any of the publicity work on this
                        project?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEEDHAM: Yes, we backed this, not only with press coverage and photos and stills
                    and exhibits and seminars on housing and public health, but we also actually
                    made several short motion picture documentaries right there on the scene.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which were then, subsequently, shown in other
                        Spanish-speaking countries and, also, all over Guatemala, I suppose?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEEDHAM: Yes. Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have a field motion picture program there?</hi>

                <p>Guatemalan Government Land Distribution Project Assisted by AID and Publicized by
                    USIS - Especially Through Motion Picture Program</p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>NEEDHAM: Yes, we did. It was rather extensive. There was a land reclamation
                    project on the western plain, bordering the Pacific, in which Guatemalan
                    farmers—or tenant farmers, I should say, really—were urged to participate in a
                    lottery drawing.Participants would receive a quarter-section of land. And at the
                    beginning, where the four quarters joined, there would be the communal things
                    that they had to have to live: the general store, the well, the clinic, and the
                    school.</p>
                <p>After that, the government would clear about half of each quarter-section,
                    leaving the other half to be cleared by the new tenant. I shouldn't say
                    “tenant,” because, in fact, they had become title-holding farmers. And this
                    worked out very well. It started up at about the same time we were working out
                    of the barancas, with urban people. By the time I left in '60, they were
                    shipping their first crop of export—corn. USIS made several motion picture
                    “shorts” on different aspects of land reclamation and farm operations, on
                    location. These were shown throughout several Latin American countries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now, was this agricultural development program something
                        that was entirely financed by the Guatemalan Government, or was it partially
                        an AID project?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEEDHAM: This was partially AID. The Guatemalan Government felt, that by giving
                    the land, they were doing their share; and we didn't argue about that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And I suppose this got, then, very extensive publicity,
                        also?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEEDHAM: Yes. This had more motion pictures on scene, at various stages of the
                    building and of the harvesting and of the sowing, the clearing; even a few of
                    them had weddings involved in the half-hour documentaries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In one sense you were publicizing what the government was
                        doing for the people, and in the other, you were also supporting the AID
                        program.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEEDHAM: Yes. All in all, it was a productive period for American policy—American
                    public policy in Guatemala.</p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>One of the, what I call affectionate, memories connected with Guatemala concerns
                    a young lad about 16 or 17 years of age, who had been working as a second
                    assistant gardener to the public affairs officer when the public affairs officer
                    had to leave the country for an extended period of time and was taking his wife
                    and sister-in-law with him; so that, he had no use for a full gardening staff
                    while he was away, and he wondered if I would take this little lad as my
                    gardener, and I said I would. He warned me that the lad could not speak, but was
                    very faithful and very clean living and a good person to have around the
                    premises.</p>
                <p>So, on that basis, we accepted him. And he came in and it was quite true.
                    Whatever you told him to do, he would do and do well; the first time or the
                    twentieth time. But there was one handicap. He did not speak. He was mute, as he
                    had been described to me by the public affairs officer, and he would not look
                    directly at you because his two front teeth were missing and he was very shy
                    about it.</p>
                <p>This was the way we received him and this is the way we accepted him at first,
                    until one day he did not come back from his Sunday day off; one Monday he was
                    not there. And the following day, Tuesday, he still was not there. I became
                    worried and went back to the small room that he had at the rear of our compound.
                    And looking among his effects, I found a carton full of correspondence lessons
                    in radio construction.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In English?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEEDHAM: In English and Spanish. I realized then that somehow or other this lad
                    was literate. I wondered about him being mute and being able to learn English. I
                    explored through the boxes, looking to see if there were Spanish courses, and it
                    is my recollection that there were; there were both English and Spanish courses
                    in the box. About this time, I began to worry about what had happened to him and
                    I took steps to trace him back to his mother's house. We understood that his
                    mother had remarried and his stepfather did not care very much to have him on
                    the premises.</p>
                <p>Well, as it turned out, that is exactly what had happened. He had gone home to
                    see his mother, had an unpleasant session with his stepfather, and after the
                    whipping had hesitated to return to our house until his face healed up. When he
                    did return, I had a talk with him. He admitted that he primarily didn't want to
                    show his teeth, which was why he didn't speak. And I said, “Well, we can do
                    something about that.”</p>
                <p>So we took him to a doctor, who referred him to a dentist, who put in peg false
                    teeth in front, and he turned out to be quite a good-looking lad. We thought
                    we'd go one step further, and we called the AID director and asked if he had any
                    openings in his trade school, and he did. He had several in sheet metal work;
                    several slots that were not being occupied.</p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>So they entered Juanito in sheet metal class and he caught hold. He continued to
                    work for us during the rest of our time in Guatemala and went to trade school
                    four nights a week. He also wrote to us after we left Guatemala, for about three
                    years. With the last letter I was very pleased; he recounted what his home was
                    like. He had his own apartment—only a one-room apartment—but he was happy. He
                    was solvent. And he ended his letter by saying, “I think I am going to marry.”
                    That was the last I ever heard from him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's the last you heard from him?</hi>

                <p>NEEDHAM: Yes.</p>
                <p>1960: From Guatemala to Paraguay as Country PAO</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And when, then, did you leave Guatemala? And where did you
                        go from there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEEDHAM: Well, I left Guatemala for Paraguay. I was promoted to public affairs
                    officer and direct-transferred to Paraguay in June of '60. And that began
                    another story.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, from Guatemala, then, you went to Paraguay. So why
                        don't you go ahead with your aims and interests and activities in
                        Paraguay?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEEDHAM: Paraguay was a different program entirely. I replaced PAO Byron Winstead
                    in 1960, in July or June. And I found a much smaller program than the program I
                    had been working with in Guatemala, and one of totally different character.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there as PAO in 1960?</hi>

                <p>Constraints on a USIS Program Operating in a Country Tightly Controlled by a
                    Restrictive Dictator</p>
                <p>NEEDHAM: Yes. And this difference in program character was essentially
                    attributable to one man's personality, that of the last and longest-term
                    dictator in Latin America, Alfredo Stroessner, who had succeeded to power
                    through a coup several years earlier, and, even now, is only recently out of
                    office.</p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>The ambassador and his counselors were required to work very closely with the
                    president. Embassy relationships were almost on a one-to-one basis with
                    President Stroessner and members of his Cabinet. The USIS operation was less
                    involved in these substantive matters than we had been in Guatemala or in other
                    posts in which I had served.</p>
                <p>After the initial getting acquainted period, which lasted a month or two, I found
                    that the post was, generally, well equipped, but seemed to lack program
                    direction, particularly among the operating sections. And I began to go through
                    the sections and determine such things as key audiences for motion picture
                    activities, key audiences, or needful places that would welcome exhibits, and to
                    cultivate the few newspapers that existed in the country; and to strengthen the
                    press section, establishing a closer liaison with the working Paraguayan
                    press.</p>
                <p>A major asset to the post, already a long time in place, was the binational
                    center in the heart of Asunci�n, the capital. Here, we had a long-standing
                    program of languages, exhibits, lectures, social events, dances, concerts,
                    seminars, and it was a rather well-used facility and the only one of its kind in
                    the capital. It was popular with the families and the students of the opposite
                    political persuasion; that is, opposite to the president's persuasion.</p>

                <p>NEEDHAM: That was the Colorado Party, and the opposition was known as the Liberal
                    Party. At times, I often wondered if our binational center hadn't become a
                    Liberal redoubt, because over the years the open academic atmosphere had proved
                    very invitational to people who thought of themselves as being a suppressed
                    opposition.</p>
                <p>It was difficult, at times, to ignore this fact. When it reached a point where I
                    thought it might be embarrassing to the embassy, in its relationship with the
                    president, I would cultivate the Colorado side of the community in an attempt to
                    stimulate events which were of less political persuasion. It was a continuing
                    thing to watch. Fortunately, it never became serious.</p>
                <p>We did find, at the beginning of the second year, a need out in the countryside.
                    In the second largest city in Paraguay, Villarica, we found a certain
                    intellectual life and community, evincing an interest in establishing a
                    binational center if we could provide some help. They had a building and land
                    already held aside. The building, a former mansion, needed refurbishing. It was
                    a large building. It had a ballroom which would become an auditorium. It had an
                    extensive service kitchen. It had several large rooms, which would make library
                    sections—very pleasant. And it had good grounds, which could serve for outdoor
                    social occasions. It was located in a good neighborhood and we saw very little
                    objection to raise against it. We promised to take it under advisement.</p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>I did this, and discussed it with Ambassador Harry Stimpson at the time, who
                    thought that it was a worthy idea. We were preparing a request to the agency for
                    supplemental funds to make a grant, when a committee from Villarica appeared in
                    my office one day and announced that they had already launched a fund raising
                    committee in Villarica. So this all worked quite rapidly, and about eight months
                    later we had a full day of dedication ceremonies which the ambassador attended.
                    This is probably the only binational center that was ever built entirely with
                    local funds.</p>
                <p>That about describes the program that we instituted. We did pay a little more
                    attention to the boondocks audience than I have indicated so far, particularly
                    in the third year. There are a number of communities along the Paraguay River,
                    which borders the west and the south of Paraguay, an inland country. We operated
                    a small launch, with a motion picture crew, up and down that river, two or three
                    times during the year; equipping the launch with motion pictures, pamphlets and
                    exhibits materials, and establishing contact with many of the villages along the
                    shore of the river.</p>
                <p>We also did a similar-type program inland, using an ox cart to reach certain
                    places which were not connected by any road. But this, perforce, was given less
                    emphasis in our program work than the capital itself, where 75% of the people in
                    Paraguay reside and work.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Are these field operations largely motion picture in
                        character?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEEDHAM: Yes, yes. Illiteracy still exists in remote parts of rural Paraguay.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I suppose some distribution of pamphlets?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEEDHAM: That's right. While we were doing this, establishing an American
                    presence of educational and friendly interest in the country and its people, the
                    ambassador and his counselors were pursuing a very sensitive, substantive
                    program with a “difficult” president. I think that Ambassador Snow was most
                    influential with President Stroessner in rescuing the guaran� from really
                    serious threatened inflation during the year 1962.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The guaran� being the monetary unit of Paraguay.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEEDHAM: That's right. I can't remember just exactly what the exchange rate to
                    the dollar was, at that particular time, but it was extraordinarily high; I do
                    remember that. Ambassador Snow convinced President Stroessner that an approach
                    to cure this threatening situation would be to have an IMF, International
                    Monetary Fund, team of experts come in and do the survey and make
                    recommendations.</p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>To our surprise, President Stroessner agreed. He, perhaps, had no other choice. I
                    think the ambassador played this ploy very well, because in the space of several
                    months the president proceeded to accept almost all the recommendations of the
                    IMF team. He curtailed certain outgoes in the national budget and instituted
                    some reforms in taxing; and, in general, took domestic measures to curb
                    inflation in the country.</p>
                <p>Eventually, he was at the point, in terms of the guarani's value, where he could
                    have dismissed the IMF monitoring operation, which was continuously going on.
                    And for a while, Ambassador Snow was concerned that the president might do that.
                    He finally broached the situation to the president, and to his great relief,
                    President Stroessner said, “I wouldn't be without them.” And so, they continued
                    in place and were still in place when I left in late 1962.</p>
                <p>Late 1962: Reassignment to Washington as Latin American Guidance Officer in
                    Office of Policy and Plans (IOP)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And to what assignment did you go from Paraguay?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEEDHAM: I was reassigned to Washington for duty as Latin American Guidance
                    Officer in the Office of Policy and Plans.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As Guidance Officer, what, precisely, were your duties and
                        responsibilities?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEEDHAM: As one can imagine, an agency that is operating an international press
                    service, the Voice of America, an International Radio Broadcasting Service, in
                    many languages, to many countries, on affairs which are of interest to these
                    countries, has a certain responsibility to support and not embarrass official
                    policy of a substantive nature. And that puts forth the reason for, what I call,
                    guidance. It was a matter of recommending to the operating elements of the
                    Agency treatment of issues and matters, which the Agency was passing along
                    through its media services to all of the foreign posts overseas. In my case, of
                    course, just the Latin American posts.</p>
                <p>The routine consisted of getting into the office rather early in the morning and
                    reading the New York Times, the Washington Post, the three wire services, and,
                    also, the foreign broadcast intelligence service. In addition to that, there
                    might be as many as 50 to 150 telegrams, that had come in overnight, in your
                    “IN” box. And these were scanned for pertinent matters requiring treatment,
                    consultation, and/or guidance.</p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>From that session one walked over to the State Department and conferred with his
                    opposite number desk officers to see if there were matters of substantive nature
                    involved, which required special treatment. From these consultations was
                    composed a guidance each day, which was put forth at what we called the “noon
                    conference.” The noon conference was an assembly of representatives, also
                    policy-guiding officers, from each of the media elements of the agency and the
                    area guidance officers, such as myself, for each of the five areas.</p>
                <p>And that meeting was extraordinarily efficient. We were able to get through it,
                    in almost every case, in less than half an hour. The guidance that each area
                    officer laid down presumably would hold for at least 24 hours. When superseded
                    by events, the necessary amendments were the responsibility of the area Guidance
                    Officer.</p>
                <p>In addition to doing this fast guidance work, each of us was responsible for
                    long-term guidance in the form of special typed memorandums, known as
                    news-policy notes. I recall many an hour of sweat and toil over these papers.
                    They took several weeks in the composition, a lot of research, a lot of
                    conference with the State Department and other related agencies having an
                    interest in the matter or in the country, and finally, lots of concurrences
                    before they became true, long-term policy guidance papers.</p>
                <p>Another facet of the duties of guidance officers at the policy and plans level
                    was to maintain very close liaison with the area offices of the agency; that is,
                    the assistant directors and their staffs for each area, and in my case, the
                    Latin American area. I can remember Assistant Director for Latin America, Kermit
                    Brown, so very well, before his untimely death, and what a joy it was to confer
                    with Kermit and his staff. That was to coordinate not only what was going on in
                    the field with policy, but often to coordinate policy with what was going on in
                    the field.</p>

                    Country</p>
                <p>I continued in this capacity until late 1965, when it came my turn to do a tour
                    in Vietnam. I was in Vietnam, with JUSPAO, under Barry Zorthian and Harry
                    Casler, first as press attach� to the ambassador, who was Mr. Henry Cabot Lodge
                    at that time, and then later on special duty developing materials for the South
                    Vietnamese Government; materials of a feature nature.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I know several of our people had some doubts as to how
                        effective the JUSPAO program was, and I wonder whether or not you have any
                        opinion as to whether we, in JUSPAO, had any substantial long-range or
                        short-range effect in Vietnam?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>NEEDHAM: Well, Lew, we certainly had some effect just by being there. But that
                    has to be largely on a short-range basis. We had representatives in the
                    provinces and I have no doubt that, to a certain extent, at that time there was
                    some advantage gained. But I don't think it was of a lasting nature. And I would
                    say that holds true for the largest part of the JUSPAO program, except for the
                    work that Douglas Pike did in research and study, which was very deep, very
                    substantive, and which I understand is still of considerable current value and
                    use.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, it certainly is. We have an interview with Doug Pike,
                        in which he goes into his opinions and his work in Vietnam. He was there for
                        15 years. He's now, of course, with the Institute of East Asian Studies at
                        the University of California, at Berkeley, where he continues to be
                        considered, practically, the country's expert on Vietnam.</hi>

                <p>1967: Return to IOP Latin America Policy Guidance Position. Disagreement Leads to
                    Reassignment</p>
                <p>NEEDHAM: I returned from Vietnam in '67 and, fortunately, and happily, my old
                    slot in IOP was vacant and I was asked if I would like to have it again. I
                    replied affirmatively, because I had enjoyed the first tour in IOP very much;
                    found the work extremely interesting and felt effective whilst doing it. So from
                    1967 through most of 1968, I was back on the Latin American desk and enjoyed it
                    until it came time to move on and I reported for duty elsewhere.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I understand that you had a little trouble before you left
                        the second time. Would you go into that a bit?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEEDHAM: [Laughter] All right, Lew. I should have known I wasn't going to get off
                    the hook that easily. Well, my tenure with IOP terminated, rather abruptly, in a
                    personal disagreement over work, specifically over a news policy note which I
                    had been preparing for several months, and through several drafts, and which
                    John Pauker, the then-chief of the fast guidance section, was consistently
                    refusing to pass on for our director's approval.</p>
                <p>I ran out of patience. John ran out of patience. And we had a very strident
                    set-to one evening after work hours in his office. It was so strident as to be
                    final. And the next morning I went down to personnel and asked for relief from
                    that assignment, and assignment to something else, leaving the choice up to
                    personnel.</p>
                <p>Six Months in Lagos, Nigeria at Time of So-called Biafran Rebellion</p>
                <p>Personnel's choice was to send me out to Nigeria, to Lagos. This was during the
                    attempted revolt, led by a gentleman named Ojukwu; generally know as the Biafra
                    episode.</p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>NEEDHAM: Personnel had proposed me to the director for approval as a deputy PAO
                    on temporary duty at Lagos, under PAO Beverly Carter, with special
                    responsibilities for guidance to the State Department and the Agency. The area
                    director, who at that time was John Reinhardt (he later became Director of
                    USIA), was gracious and supportive in this appointment, for which I was grateful
                    at that time, and remain grateful to this day; because it turned out to be a
                    most interesting and rewarding six months in Lagos.</p>
                <p>My duties in Lagos were rather simply defined. I was to provide the State
                    Department and the Agency with a pr�cis, one every 12 hours, on the state of
                    public and official opinion in Nigeria, with regard to the Biafran conflict.
                    These telegrams were for the ambassador's signature and, of course, required his
                    approval. This was a rather strenuous, but routine, work consisting of
                    interviews daily with the ministries and with the president's entourage; and a
                    review of the local press, with some personal contact with publishers and
                    editors.</p>
                <p>The necessity for these telegrams arose from the need for the State Department,
                    primarily, and also USIA—for guidance in handling the news—to be aware of the
                    situation in Lagos, primarily to keep a firm foothold on the tug of war in
                    public opinion going on in both countries.</p>
                <p>There was sentiment in America for American intervention in the Biafran
                    situation, and there was sentiment against it. This was also true in Lagos.
                    There were segments of President Gowon's government that felt the United States
                    should intervene on their side, and there were others who felt that the last
                    thing in the world they wanted to see was American intervention in Nigerian
                    affairs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's very interesting, because I think you probably know
                        that within the States there was a great tendency on the part of the media
                        in the U.S. to side with the Biafran attempt to overthrow the central
                        government. And I think if you could have measured the feeling in this
                        country, at least along the eastern seaboard, they were primarily in favor
                        of a Biafran victory, rather than in favor of the central government
                        victory. You never had an opportunity to sample Biafran opinion, I
                        gather?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEEDHAM: Well, Lew, practically no Americans got over to the Biafran side, as we
                    call it. Incidentally, Biafra is a term that was floated by Ojukwu and his
                    lieutenants, and came to America via press correspondents. In reality, there is
                    no such place as Biafra. There is Eastern and Western Nigeria. The eastern part
                    of Nigeria is that occupied by the Ibos, who are rated one of the superior
                    tribes, historically, in that part of Africa.</p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>Biafra is a bight of the Atlantic Ocean down at the extreme southwest coast of
                    Nigeria, principally known through its main port, which is Port Harcourt. The
                    only contact, that I'm aware of, that Americans may have had with the east of
                    Nigeria during this period is, perhaps, through some of the convoys conveying
                    medicines and foods to both sides of the conflict. Starvation had been one of
                    the weapons against the Biafran rebels.</p>
                <p>America had said that we would not intervene in this conflict, but that we would
                    provide medicine and supplies to those needful on both sides of the issue. And
                    that was done. It had a rather slow, but long-reaching, effect. It probably
                    supported the final settlement of the conflict, which became amicable, and today
                    Nigeria is one nation, not having been divided by this rebellion.</p>
                <p>Return to U.S.: Short Tour as Deputy Director for Bureau of Public Affairs in
                    African Area, State Department</p>
                <p>NEEDHAM: Upon returning from Nigeria, I was queried by State Department
                    personnel, to see if I would be interested in acting as Deputy Director for the
                    Bureau of Public Affairs in the African area of the State Department.</p>
                <p>Having freshly returned from Africa, I was, naturally, still very interested in
                    that continent, and it seemed like a decent opportunity to round out almost 20
                    years of service with USIA. So I very happily took the assignment, which lasted
                    for almost a year.</p>
                <p>Then, I returned to USIA in order to replace Mike Giufreda, who had had a heart
                    attack.Mike was chief of the Near East branch of IPS.</p>
                <p>So I finished off my career, really, in my home section of the Agency, which was
                    IPS. And I must say, in conclusion, that it was a very enjoyable 20 years and I
                    don't regret a moment of it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, Howard, I think earlier you had told me you had a
                        couple of temporary assignments, which I think, in our interest in getting
                        over to some of the specific areas where you served, we didn't cover. And
                        you might want to say a word, before we conclude the interview, about those
                        couple of temporary assignments or special assignments.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEEDHAM: Yes, I know the ones you mean, Lew. You're talking about a year in which
                    I was an oral examiner for the State Department; going about the country—our own
                    country—interviewing and listening to the minds of very bright young Americans
                    who had already passed the stiff, written State Department examination for
                    candidacy to be a Foreign Service officer.</p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>The second stage, of course, with their vetting was the oral exam. And together
                    with several of our colleagues, in a rotating order, I had the pleasure of
                    talking to these young people, who aspired to be Foreign Service Officers, and
                    of listening to the brightness of their minds. We accepted very few compared to
                    the many who were pressing at the doors. But that has always been the case in
                    the Foreign Service examination procedures.</p>
                <p>The only other interim assignment I can think of, that was of interest, was one
                    trip to Afghanistan in 1970 as an inspector. The inspection was routine. USIA
                    was staffed at Kabul with a competent group, headed up by Peter Brescia. We
                    found some dissension between the embassy and the USIS operation, but that was
                    rather quickly straightened out.</p>
                <p>The thing I remember most vividly was, every visitation that we made to elements
                    of the Afghan Government seemed to conclude with the Afghani officials urging
                    the United States to enter the scene in Afghanistan and establish a much larger
                    presence, because they felt they were about to be gobbled up by the Soviet
                    Republic.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Howard, I think we've covered most of your activities in
                        the Agency. And unless you have something that you want to add, I think we
                        might as well conclude the interview. To me, it's been a very interesting
                        one, and I think it's well worthwhile. I'm very grateful to you for having
                        given us the time to do this. I know it's been rather a long stint. So
                        thanks a lot for your patience and your contribution to our project.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEEDHAM: You're more than welcome, Lew.</p>
