                <p>Q: Today is the 10th of April 1998. This is an interview with Ambassador Lawrence
                    P. Taylor and it's being done on behalf of the Association for Diplomatic
                    Studies, and I'm Charles Stuart Kennedy. Larry, let's start at the beginning.
                    When and where were you born?</p>
                <p>TAYLOR: I was born in Cleveland, Ohio, in 1940.</p>
                <p>Q: Can you tell me something about your family, what your parents' occupations
                    were and then something about your early years in Cleveland, if you grew up and
                    started in Cleveland?</p>
                <p>TAYLOR: I did start in Cleveland. My parents were both from Illinois. My dad
                    graduated from the University of Michigan. My mother from the University of
                    Chicago. My dad was research chemist. Despite her education, my mother was a
                    classical housewife of the day. I think one of the distinguishing things was
                    that my dad came from some background that was extremely successful and even
                    wealthy, until the great depression hit.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, 1929.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SPROTT: 1929, and this was the jumping-out-of-windows era, and his family,
                    although not literally, figuratively jumped out of a window, and five children
                    in that family, instead of being in a situation of means, then found themselves
                    working four at a time, each to send the odd one, the fifth one, through
                    college. And so they bootstrapped all five through college, and my dad landed a
                    job with Union Carbide as a research chemist.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So how long did you live in Cleveland?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: Right, we lived in Cleveland really only through the early years of grade
                    school, and then we moved to Pittsburgh and stayed in Pittsburgh until my
                    sophomore year in high school and then moved back to Cleveland.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In your early education, both in Cleveland and then
                        iPittsburgh, what type of schooling were you getting?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: It was public schools. It was very, I think, kind of conventional U.S.
                    big city public schools of the day. It was a good solid education. There was
                    little discipline problems. People threw spitballs and yelled and so forth. Not
                    the kind of things you see today, but it was very much a middle-class
                    neighborhood public school education.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about interest in reading and books and all. I mean,
                        dianything sort of grab your interest as a young lad?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: It sure did, and that again comes from my family. My dad was a book
                    collector, of antiquarian books, and the house was full of books from the time I
                    can remember visualizing colors and shapes, and I suppose from that I acquired a
                    similar sort of interest. So I read avidly, usually history, geography, travel
                    sorts of things. Not the science and mathematics books -</p>
                <p>Q: Richard Haliburton and all that sort of thing?</p>
                <p>TAYLOR: That's the kind of thing. Absolutely right. And then over time and
                    through my Foreign Service career I've continued to be a collector of
                    antiquarian books and antiquarian maps and printed ephemera of political and
                    military events. And I suppose it all started back there with my dad's huge
                    bookshelf captivating me at a young age.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes. What about while you were going through high
                        schooparticularly, did any teachers get to you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: Yes, there were several teachers that stand out. They really made an
                    impression. They went beyond the classroom and made an impression as a
                    personality and opened minds and eyes beyond the subject matter, but there was
                    one in particular in junior high school that was really, without knowing it, a
                    kind of threshold even. Part of the class was to read newspapers and to discuss
                    articles in the newspaper, and I remember reading the newspaper in that portion
                    of the class, and I remember putting up my hand and asking the teacher - this
                    was when Eisenhower was president, and it was about something in Geneva, and I
                    can't remember all the details, but it was mysterious, it was important, it was
                    far away - that's the way it was presented. And I put up my hand, and I asked
                    her, I said, “Somebody must work on this. Who actually works on this?” And she
                    knew the answer. She said, “There's a Foreign Service, there's a diplomatic
                    service. They do the staff work. President Eisenhower and Secretary Dulles,
                    they're the top, but there's this whole pyramid of people who actually work
                    every day professionally on foreign affairs.” And that was an eye-opener to me,
                    and I remember thinking to myself at that time, that's what I want to do.</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Isn't that amazing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: It is amazing.</p>
                <p>Q: It's both perceptive on your part at the point, you may ask the question, but
                    the odds of having a teacher who could really give an answer, I mean, enough to
                    elicit this - well, did this set your reading, your studies, off in that
                    direction at all?</p>
                <p>TAYLOR: It certainly did. It made me much more serious about history, about
                    foreign cultures, about international events and following those events on a
                    daily basis, in addition to reading the historical background and so forth.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At the high school, what were you doing. I mean, were
                        there anparticular things? I mean, I assume you were chasing girls,
                        but-</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: Well, I wish I'd done more of that, actually. So of these things, if you
                    could do over again, I didn't do as well as I should have. Actually, I was
                    playing a lot of sports, and particularly basketball, at the time. It was a very
                    important thing of me, and I spent an awful lot of time trying to improve my
                    basketball skills.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which stood you in great stead later on, I assume.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: It certainly did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then, by this time you would have been graduated in,
                        what,about 1958?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: I graduated from high school in 1958, that's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where were you pointing yourself, or what were you going
                        to do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: You know, I wasn't pointing myself anywhere. I came from a family in
                    which I simply accepted that when one got to that age, one went to college, but
                    I hadn't thought seriously about it at all, and I sort of went with the flow of
                    my contemporaries and my friends and landed at Ohio University at Athens, Ohio,
                    without really thinking why I was doing that, except that I had a basketball
                    scholarship. But I had basketball scholarship offers from other colleges and
                    universities as well. But there I was in Athens, Ohio.</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the campus in 1958 of Athens, Ohio, like?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: Well, through the eyes of an 18-year-old from Cleveland, it seemed to be
                    big and very attractive, a lot of nice-looking young women. I remember a very
                    small gym, but they were building a bigger one, and a lot of very good
                    basketball players. That's the way I started out, thinking about Ohio
                    University.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So much for the intellectual thrust of American
                        youth.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: There wasn't much of that at that moment. I was really more interested in
                    trying to live successfully away from home and establish a network of
                    relationships that I was comfortable with, and the easiest way to do that at the
                    time was through my basketball skills.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about courses? Were you taking mainly general
                        courses, odid you find yourself forced into trying to come up with a
                        major?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: I knew I wanted to major in something like history or geography, and at
                    the time, there was an expected set of freshman courses. You could select, but
                    there were guidelines, and you operated within those guidelines, and I took what
                    was expected of a freshman at that point who was pointing not to an engineering
                    degree or a math degree but to something in the social sciences.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the Foreign Service come up at all when you first
                        enterecollege?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: Not in the first year at all, no. It came up at all in, I think, big-time
                    ways about the end of my sophomore year and then started to dominate my thinking
                    in the junior and senior years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, let's see. You were in college during the time
                        wheKennedy was elected.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: I certainly was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did that have an effect on you?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>TAYLOR: Oh, a big effect. I left college - I don't mean I left it permanently,
                    but I missed a few classes - to go over and campaign for Senator Kennedy in the
                    neighboring state of West Virginia, in his primary run against Hubert Humphrey
                    there. One of the most exciting moments was actually spending a great deal of
                    time with him and his brother through an accidental airport meeting in
                    Parkersburg, West Virginia, of all places. It was a much simpler time in
                    America, and people moved around without the benefit of huge security cordons,
                    and sort of little ordinary citizens might bump into somebody like that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What particularly struck you about Kennedy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: Well, at the time, I was simply excited by his youth and his intelligence
                    and his ability to articulate a vision and a sense of mission for the
                    country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And sort of by your junior or senior years, where were you
                        going?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: Well, I knew exactly where I was going: I was going into the Peace Corps.
                    And that's the kind of thing that President Kennedy had inspired in me, and I
                    knew I wanted to join the Peace Corps, and I knew after that I wanted to join
                    the Foreign Service. And when I graduated from college I did join the Peace
                    Corps. But I did take a year off. I took a whole year off, much to the
                    consternation of everybody who knew me at the time, feeling that I would be
                    lost, and I hitchhiked around Europe for a year, staying at youth hostels. They
                    were only 25 cents a night in those days, and I spent 11 months in Europe. I'm
                    proud to say I did that on... I went over on the Queen Mary and came back on the
                    Queen Elizabeth, the old one. I got a cut-rate ticket. They were less than $300
                    each way, and I lived for 11 months in Europe on under $500, if you can believe
                    that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well this was what, this would have been '62.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: That was '62, so I graduated in '63.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So your Wanderjahr was '62?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: That's right. It should have been my senior year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This, of course, was before the time turned into a pursuit
                        ohashish and all that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: Oh, yes. Much before that. I didn't even know anythinabout that.</p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This wasn't part of the scene then. What struck you about

                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: History, the weight of the past, the interest of the past, to be sure,
                    different cultures and different languages, different values, different
                    perspectives on issues that I cared about and ordinary issues of life. It was a
                    really, I think, exhilarating and broadening experience. I couldn't do it again
                    today. I'd collapse under the effort, but for somebody who was 22 and full of
                    energy, it was just terrific.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get into places like Yugoslavia or Czechoslovakia,
                        placelike that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: I did not. I did spend, though, a number of months, fascinating months,
                    in a Berlin that had just had the wall built, and it was a very exciting place,
                    very, very exciting place, and the people and the activities of the day were
                    really, I guess, something for some young guy out of middle-class Ohio.</p>
                <p>Q: I was wondering what you were picking up there right after the wall was built?
                    I know there was concern on our part that with this wall would mean that all the
                    young people would leave, there was no place to go, and pretty soon the place
                    would kind of wither.</p>
                <p>TAYLOR: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were pretty young to be picking this up, but I was
                        wonderinwhether you were getting any feel from the youth that you were

                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: Well, it was just the opposite from the groups I was out with, and I
                    couldn't see the bigger trends. Maybe the bigger trends were in the other
                    direction, but I lived in youth hostels, and I ran around with people my age and
                    somewhat older but mainly in their 20s, and actually, young people were coming
                    there to sort of see what was going on and to experience the vibrancy of the
                    student culture and the young people's activities at the time. And I thought it
                    was just one of the most exciting environments that I'd ever been in.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel a difference between the American student at

                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>TAYLOR: No, I didn't, nor did I feel all that estranged or different later when I
                    was in the Peace Corps in Colombia in dealing with Colombian students. It all
                    changed, though, during Vietnam, and then you started to see these big
                    differences develop and emotional attitudes and so forth. But still, in '62, in
                    Europe, I think for young people with a flexible mind, it was very easy to
                    establish a common ground and to go from there.</p>

                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: History. History and economics. One of the things that I had not
                    understood when I went to college was economics, and by the time I got to my
                    junior year, I thought that this was really a subject that I needed to know a
                    great deal more about, and I had begun to take an awful lot of economics along
                    with the history.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you say you'd sort of pointed yourself towards the
                        PeacCorps.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: I did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you get in, and what happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: I guess I got in by mistake or by luck. That depends on how you look at
                    it. But there was an application procedure, and I went through that. I was
                    selected for Peace Corps volunteer training in New Mexico, at the University of
                    New Mexico, and went to that, and after that was accepted as a volunteer and was
                    assigned to Colombia, to a rural community development project in Colombia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the Peace Corps people you
                        were witat the University of New Mexico?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>TAYLOR: Well, the University of New Mexico was the training site. The volunteer
                    trainees were from all over the country, although the greatest numbers were from
                    New York and California, and there was also a disproportionately high number of
                    people who were left-handed, which I remember we all thought - I was not one of
                    them, but we all thought - that this was something important that somebody ought
                    to do a dissertation about. I'll tell you, it was marvelous, because these were
                    the kind of people I liked, and it was so easy to form very close and immediate
                    connections and friendships with almost every one of them, and it was a
                    tremendous experience.</p>
                <p>Q: Were you going through sort of midnight questions about asking what the hell
                    can I, as a history-economics major from the middle of the United States, do
                    down in Colombia?</p>
                <p>TAYLOR: No, that comes after we get to Colombia. What can I really do? At the
                    time, most of us had great confidence that we had something to offer, even
                    though we probably couldn't have been very definite about what it was, and
                    remember, this was the beginning of the Peace Corps as well. I think it's riding
                    at that point on enthusiasm, on emotion, on a sense of commitment, but hasn't
                    yet come to grips with connecting all of that with real skills and real needs.
                    That's the connection that still has to be worked with and that we face in
                    practical ways when we're actually down there on the site.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, what about Spanish?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: I had had some Spanish in college, and they provided some training at the
                    time. Again, this was a system that was not yet worked out. Language training in
                    the Peace Corps subsequently became much better. It was more or less haphazard.
                    But when you piece together what I'd had in college with what I had in the Peace
                    Corps, it was enough then to learn by doing down there. You weren't starting at
                    all from ground zero.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So where did you go in Colombia?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>TAYLOR: It was in the province of Antioqu�a. It's out in the countryside, a small
                    little community called Betania, and the work was something that was very much
                    in vogue at the time, which is rural community development, and it was based on
                    what we believed, at the time, was the experience in the Philippines a couple of
                    decades earlier, in which, by working at community levels to organize
                    communities to develop the capacity to solve their local problems without
                    waiting for federal governments or churches or outside organizations to do it
                    for them, you could actually instill a sense of participation and democracy from
                    the grassroots up. That was dovetailed, at the time, into President Kennedy's
                    Alliance for Progress and the notion that if there was not social change in
                    Latin America by peaceful means, there would be the inevitable change through
                    revolutionary means, and we believed that we were out there as part of that
                    agent of peaceful social revolution that would build democracy and build
                    participation and prevent the kind of revolution that had occurred in Cuba.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, now, can you describe your locale before we get to

                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: Yes, let me tell you first that it was very high up, and I'm a guy who's
                    afraid of heights. It was very high up in the mountains, and these crazy buses
                    going around these absolutely hairpin turns, high up in the Andes Mountains - I
                    certainly remember that very well. It's a nice little town on the Spanish model,
                    with a nice central plaza where people sit out and have a beer or a soft drink
                    or whatever, and that's the social center of the town, and then it's dominated,
                    as most of these little places are, by a very substantial church building and
                    then the municipal buildings, the government, the National Association of Coffee
                    Growers and others have their offices around; and then that's a nodal center
                    then for an agricultural region in which mainly coffee is grown, and the only
                    way you can get out to that agricultural region is by getting on a mule, because
                    a horse will fall off these country trails. And you ride out there on these
                    hairpin turns, instead of on a little one-lane bus road, now you're on a
                    one-track mule road, and it's beautiful and exciting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, then, how were you received there? You must have
                        been onof the earliest ones.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: Yes, we were one of the earliest ones, although Colombia was even at that
                    time a very big program for the Peace Corps. Now later when it becomes a
                    narco-state, all of that is pulled out, but at the time, this is intended to be
                    a model for the Alliance for Progress, and the Peace Corps is being poured in
                    there. During the time I was there, I think the number of volunteers built up to
                    several hundred. It was extraordinary, and all over the country - not
                    concentrated in Bogot� or the big cities but all over the countryside,
                    consistent with its philosophy of rural community development and grassroots
                    organization empowerment for local communities.</p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>But we were received, I suppose, with a mix of wonder and of courtesy - wonder
                    about who we really are and what the heck are we doing there, and just
                    traditional down-home courtesy that said we're not sure why they're here, but
                    they're nice and we're nice and we're going to welcome them.</p>
                <p>Q: Well, you went out there with an eye to doing this rural development. How
                    would you characterize the rural development at the time you went there? What
                    were you going to be working on?</p>
                <p>TAYLOR: The philosophy of community development is really a philosophy of
                    creating an empowerment of the community. It is through the community's own
                    empowerment, then, that specific projects happen. Often that intermediate step,
                    that first step of building the empowerment, is forgotten, and people talk about
                    community development being building a water system or a school or a medical
                    center. It's only community development, as opposed to a project, if the
                    community has been brought together and given a sense of empowerment and has
                    itself decided that, as a priority, it wishes to build something like a water
                    system or a school and then proceeds to find a way to do it. The Peace Corps's
                    mission at that point, as we understood it, was to create that sense of
                    empowerment. Now there were organizations that understood this concept locally
                    and that were willing to be partners. One was the National Association of Coffee
                    Growers in Colombia. They did many things in the countryside associated with the
                    coffee industry, but they had many members who understood the importance of
                    community empowerment leading to community improvements through projects. And
                    they were willing to be helpful in trying to organize a community. In the
                    community we were in, there were also three full-time priests. Two of them were
                    old-style conservative priests whose mission in life was what you would expect.
                    One was a very young priest who had a reform mission in mind, who thought that
                    the church had to be more socially minded and had to work to the improvement of
                    the community, and especially of the peasants, in order to bring about peaceful
                    change. And he was very eager to help gather the community and try to develop a
                    sense of empowerment and decision leading to projects. And there were some
                    teachers in the area who understood that concept and believed in it. So you
                    start by finding who your natural allies who have credibility, who have reach,
                    who have some power in the community might be and organize them into a nucleus
                    that then reaches further and tries to draw in wider sections of the community
                    to the process.</p>
                <p>Q: But when you look to your natural supporters, you must have natural - not
                    enemies but - opponents, because you must be breaking the rice bowl of the local
                    chiefs, the ca�ds, what do they call them?</p>
                <p>TAYLOR: Caudillos?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I don't know, but I mean I would think that you would be
                        stirrinup the pot?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>TAYLOR: Well, if you got too successful you might, but when you're just out there
                    trying to plant an acorn, probably they're not worried it's going to grow into
                    an oak tress. They probably think you don't know what an acorn is anyhow, much
                    less can grow it successfully. One of the interesting things about the Peace
                    Corps, though, was that to some extent it coopted the natural opposition. The
                    natural opposition is the vested established power structure in some cases, but
                    the Peace Corps came with an on-high blessing. President Kennedy had a magical
                    image in Latin America at the time and in Colombia at the time, and the
                    government of Colombia, starting with the president but ending down through the
                    structure down to the local level, know that the Peace Corps was President
                    Kennedy's personal program, and doors that would not be open to others would be
                    open to Peace Corps volunteers. You had to know how to use them and know how to
                    take advantage of them, but many centers of potential opposition - if this were
                    coming from another source - were actually lukewarm supporters or, at least,
                    neutral if it was coming from the Peace Corps, because they would not oppose
                    President Kennedy's program. There was a kind of intellectual and emotional
                    reach that was very helpful to us.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you there when Kennedy was assassinated?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: Oh, I sure was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did that hit?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: It hit me like a sucker-punch in the solar plexus, but what was, I think,
                    more interesting is the effect it had in the community. I'll never forget it. I
                    think that community and every community I knew of or later heard about in rural
                    Colombia seemed to be as affected by that event as America was, and I still
                    remember the endless lines of mules and horses and people that walked out of the
                    countryside to come in and tell us, who were the only Americans they knew, how
                    sorry they were and that in this Catholic country they all burned candles on the
                    night after, when people knew that he had died. The whole countryside, as far as
                    an eye could see, was full of candles. There's no electricity out there, but
                    every little hut for as far as the eye could see had lit a candle in remembrance
                    of President Kennedy. It was, in a depressing sense, kind of a magical
                    moment.</p>
                <p>Q: Well, it was. I was in Yugoslavia, and you could buy Kennedy's picture in the
                    local outdoor farm markets and all, little plastic frames and all, along with

                <p>TAYLOR: Yes, I went to Yugoslavia later. I didn't know you'd been there. I was in
                    both Zagreb and Belgrade 10 years later in the Foreign Service.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, let's talk a bit about your work. How did the work
                        go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: Well, I guess the way to put it is, I learned a lot more than they did.
                    It went all right, but it's a very slow process, and a process that, I think,
                    never really took deep roots there. Some projects were done, but, again, I think
                    it's a mis-definition to evaluate community development by the projects. It's
                    really whether the community reaches a critical mass of awareness that it has
                    the power to solve its own problems at a certain level. And I think in that
                    sense it's something that was more generational than a one- a two- or three-year
                    effort could accomplish. But you know, it's the same with this as when I was
                    ambassador in Estonia just recently, we had Peace Corps volunteers in Estonia. I
                    mean the Peace Corps is still there, and I used to pay a lot of attention,
                    having been a former volunteer, to the health of the volunteers and the
                    integrity of the program in Estonia. And many of them had the same concerns that
                    we had had 35 years earlier, that were they really making a difference? That
                    things seemed to move so slowly, they couldn't see whether they were making a
                    contribution, and yet there's many ways in which that presence pays off. It
                    isn't just the formal task to which a volunteer has been assigned or a specific
                    “job,” and put job in quotes. The very presence of a young American, bringing a
                    new perspective, new ideas, in a community can have ripple effects that are
                    astounding, particularly on young people, and lead them in new directions,
                    directions that their lived otherwise never could have taken. So I want to be
                    careful when you say, well, how did it go? Because think it's very hard to
                    establish the right criteria to know the answer to that question. In pure
                    community development terms, I think the results were mixed at best. But in
                    terms of those ripple effects, maybe there's a very different answer.</p>
                <p>Q: As Americans we tend to be short-term thinkers and want to see, you know,
                    results within that short term, and they're not there. Certainly the Peace Corps
                    had made a major difference in the United States, because the Peace Corps people
                    have moved into all sorts of areas.</p>
                <p>TAYLOR: It's an extraordinary thing, and I have to tell you, my son's in the
                    Peace Corps. My son's in the Peace Corps in Slovakia, today as we sit here. And
                    you're right, the return volunteers and their contribution, both individually in
                    what they do but also then as an organization, have had an impact on American
                    life.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, now, you were in Colombia from '63 to about
                        '65?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: Right. And then I went to graduate school after that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any feel for the Colombian political
                        system?</hi>

                <p>TAYLOR: Oh, a great deal, sure. Let me tell you one thing that was interesting.
                    Of course, I learned later that it wasn't true, but I'm just reporting my
                    feelings of the moment, you see. All the volunteers felt that nobody in the
                    embassy know anything about Colombia. They're up there having dinner with this
                    small, elite group that all speak English and are of an international bent, but
                    here beneath that tip of the pyramid is the real Colombia, the mass of the body
                    of the iceberg, complicated and big, and that the embassy was completely out of
                    touch with it. That was one impression we had quite strongly. We had consulates
                    at the time in Medell�n and in Cali, and we had nice young consular officers at
                    the head of those consulates. We all liked those people, and went over to their
                    homes occasionally and invited them out to our sites, but we thought that the
                    Ambassador and that big staff in Bogot� were just so far out of touch. Of
                    course, we were wrong, but that's the way we felt about it at the time.</p>

                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: I'm sure, probably still repeated. Maybe all thosvolunteers in Estonia
                    think I was completely out of touch.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That old crock, thinking about his time but not really

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, so you went back, what, to grad school?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: Yes, I went back to grad school at Kent State University, and then I took
                    the Foreign Service Exam and passed it, and while I was waiting to be tapped, I
                    took the management intern exam on the civil service side and passed that and
                    was offered a job as a management intern, which I accepted. But no sooner had I
                    accepted it and started than the phone rang, and it was the Foreign Service, so
                    I switched right over and ran over and became a junior officer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At Kent State - you were at Kent State from when to
                        when?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>TAYLOR: I was at Kent State from '65 to '67, and then I went to grad school at
                    American University while I was a management intern, and then I joined the
                    Foreign Service in '69.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During this '65 to '67 and then at AU, what were you
                        taking?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: Right, I was at that point, at Kent State, I was in Latin American area
                    studies, trying to build on my Peace Corps experience. At AU, I got a master's
                    degree in economics.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you took, obviously, the written exam and then the
                        oraexam, do you recall anything about the oral exam?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: Yes, I remember it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you give me an idea of some of the questions and
                        challengeyou found at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: Well, I had heard how hard it was, and I was thinking that I must not
                    have passed it because I didn't think it was very hard so I had missed the whole
                    point of it. I took it in Chicago. I don't remember the names, but I can even
                    today see the faces of the three examiners. I found it very enjoyable. I had
                    trepidation going in, because I'd heard how difficult it was and not very many
                    people passed. I thought it was a nice conversation for about an hour and a
                    half, very different from the oral exam today, very, very different, but I was
                    pleasantly surprised when they came out almost immediately and said, “You
                    passed.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you remember any of the questions?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: Yes, I remember. There was a discussion about whether the United States,
                    in pursuit of its Cold War objectives cozied up too much to dictators and
                    authoritarian figures on the right. I remember we discussed that for a
                    considerable amount of time. They asked me who I thought the two or three best
                    Secretaries of State had been and why, after I had picked the two or three best.
                    They asked me about being able to present American values, American culture,
                    American literature to an international audience, to groups in other countries.
                    I remember those very well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you came in in when, '69?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>TAYLOR: '69, yes, very exciting time. We were there first - I think we were the
                    first, if not, we were one of the first - very big class, too big, almost 70
                    people, and segmented because about 20 of the class had been recruited on the
                    basis that they had to go to Vietnam, and when they arrived and realized there
                    were about 50 of us who had a choice, they were hopping mad, hopping mad, and in
                    addition to that, you can imagine in '69, if we weren't the first class, we were
                    certainly the first class in which a substantial portion of the class,
                    emotionally and viscerally, disagreed with our Vietnam policy. So here you have
                    joining the system that we still defending the Vietnam policy sort of the people
                    who you looked out the window at or on television and sort of said, who are
                    those people? And that produced a kind of, if not a culture war, a culture clash
                    throughout the A-100 process, as various speakers came over to tell us about our
                    Vietnam policy, and even I remember it almost produced a riot in our A-100 class
                    there were three gay people in it as I remember it, and that was at a time when
                    somebody from the Department still came over and warned us about the evils that
                    these people presented to American values and how it was our job to discover
                    them and root them out. And the class almost broke down into a riot at that
                    point, so it was a very interesting moment. It captured social and intellectual
                    trends in society here at an entry point into the system in which the joiners of
                    the system were challenging some of the old values, and it was a very
                    interesting class.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, personally, you had gone through Kent State, which
                        turneout to be a focal point in that year, or I guess it was '70.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: Right, '71 or '70.</p>
                <p>Q: Spring of '70. But you had come up through there. Let's talk about before you
                    came in the Foreign Service your view of our involvement in Vietnam. How was
                    this hitting you?</p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>TAYLOR: Well, yes, you know, I had opposed our policy in Vietnam for a long time,
                    and it goes back to my Ohio University experience there. I had a professor at
                    Ohio University - I remember him very well - Dr. John Cady, who was a Southeast
                    Asia expert, and I first took his freshman class in 1958, here just a young
                    basketball player from Cleveland, Ohio, who really didn't know much about the
                    world, and I remember this guy, who had been in OSS [Office of Strategic
                    Services] in World War II, and I remember him telling this class - it was either
                    in '58 or '59 because I took him again the next year - telling us that the way
                    things are going some of you are going to have to go off and die in South
                    Vietnam. This is '58 or '59. I didn't even know where South Vietnam was. What
                    the heck is this guy talking about? And he then proceeded in the course of that
                    class to explicate his concerns about what was happening in Vietnam and how he
                    saw American policy progressively drawing us into a situation in which, out of a
                    false belief that we were stopping communism, we would end up fighting
                    Vietnamese nationalism. And that made a big imprint on me, and it seemed as
                    though he had anticipated reality to me for a good many years, and so I had long
                    been concerned about it, but not the way so many of the opponents were. I was
                    very uncomfortable with them. I was concerned that we were getting into a war we
                    wouldn't win and that the consequences of that would be negative for U.S.
                    interests, here and around the world. I didn't share at all the opposition's
                    concerns that somehow the Vietcong and the North Vietnamese were good guys and
                    we were bad guys and that we were immoral and that they were virtuous. And so I
                    guess I was kind of an insider critic, in the sense that I accepted the standard
                    definitions that we should follow our interests, but believed that our interests
                    would be better served by not expanding our presence in Vietnam and risking the
                    loss that then did happen.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While this class was going on, were there big debates
                        abouVietnam within the class?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: There were, at a number of levels, again, partly because a subset of the
                    class had been recruited only on the basis they agreed to go to Vietnam, and
                    some of them were, as I said earlier, hopping mad about that, and they wanted to
                    talk about it, at that level, constantly. And then, of course, in a more
                    structured way, we had very many speakers come over and tell us how important it
                    was that we prevail in Vietnam and how we were prevailing, and that led to hot
                    exchanges. And of course, then, in the class itself, in our social functions and
                    getting to know each other, that was one of the main topics of conversation, as
                    it was in America of the day.</p>
                <p>Q: Did you find that your “den fathers,” “den mothers,” the people who were in
                    charge of the A-100 course, were trying to at least keep you from going to the
                    throat of those who were coming up and talking about Vietnam and all?</p>
                <p>TAYLOR: Yes, I think they tried to referee that, and did referee it in a pretty
                    helpful way. Without taking sides, they tried to establish a framework of
                    civility and orderliness about that, yes.</p>

                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: I don't think so. I don't think so. I think certain speakers went out of
                    the room shell-shocked, but I don't think that the powers that be - the real
                    powers that be - even knew we existed, much less cared about what we thought
                    about Vietnam at the moment. But certain speakers were certainly surprised.</p>
                <p>Q: Well, a little bit earlier in the game, the junior officers, particularly when
                    Kennedy came in, were looked upon as somehow born without original sin, and
                    there was an organization called Jeff Side, and they were, you know, they even
                    had the ear of the Secretary of State for a while, not much, but -</p>
                <p>TAYLOR: Yes, not much, but I don't think we had that ear any more, but I think we
                    were allowed the absence of original sin, but we didn't have the ear of the
                    Secretary of State.</p>

                    world there, somewhat of your own imagination, in the A-100 course. When you're

                    You've got an assignment. You're the low person on the totem pole. You've got to
                    worry about practical things all of a sudden. Vietnam's very far away. I'm not
                    going there. I'm going to the Dominican Republic. And so I've got a wife; I've
                    got a child; I've got to go do a brand-new job. And so that's where my focus
                    moved to in the end.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had you asked for Latin America?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: I had asked for Latin America, that's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And so you were going to the Dominican Republic.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: I went to the Dominican Republic.</p>
                <p>Q: Well, when you went out to the Dominican Republic, can you describe the
                    situation in the Dominican Republic at that time, because this was still an
                    interesting time.</p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>TAYLOR: It was a fascinating time, yes. What surprised me was how much the
                    country and the embassy still lived in the shadow of 1965 and the U.S.
                    intervention.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Explain what happened in 1965.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: Well, President Johnson decided that political events on the island
                    necessitated an American intervention, and he sent military forces to restore
                    the government. I think it was President Balaguer at the time. It turns out, of
                    course, that the personalities of 1969, 70, and 71, and even 10 years later,
                    were still the same personalities. They just never seemed to go away, Balaguer
                    and Juan Bosch. Balaguer - for all I know, he's going to be president again.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He's still going.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: It's endless, right. But what really surprised me was that there were
                    very large sections of the embassy who had come in 1965 and 66 on temporary
                    duty, who didn't seem like they were planning on leaving any time soon, although
                    their mission seemed to have gone away years earlier. I'm thinking in terms of,
                    well, the FBI still had a very large presence there, although they weren't
                    certain what they were... They were certainly enjoying their time there. You
                    know, here you have an island and a system that was still very much thought of,
                    and maybe somewhat legitimately, as being another potential Cuba.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Wow.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: And great many social problems, agrarian problems, class problems, income
                    problems, education problems, all festering around in an environment in which
                    the Cuban Revolution was riding fairly high - at least the philosophy and
                    ideology and image of it were. And when you traveled around the country you
                    could sense that and you could feel it, and it seemed to be the question of
                    peaceful evolution or violent revolution, and the question of violent
                    revolution's connection to international Communism was thinking that dominated
                    the American presence in the Dominican Republic at the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I found it interesting, looking at the map you see this
                        littlappendage called Haiti sticking out there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: Yes, there it is.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It seems to be completely two different worlds. Was there
                        anspillover?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>TAYLOR: Yes, but maybe you would expect. I was going to say, not what you would
                    expect. The spillover is basically in illegal activities, in smuggling and black
                    marketing and the bringing in of Haitian labor for sugar cane cutting season,
                    even though it's not supposed to be brought in. And the normal relations between
                    the countries didn't exist, but this kind of black market and illicit exchanges
                    did exist and were carefully controlled by the authorities on both sides to
                    serve their own interests and to be sure they stayed under control.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was our ambassador when you were there. TAYLOR: The
                        Ambassador when I arrived was Frank Meloy, Francis Meloy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who later was killed in -</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: Later killed in Lebanon, right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did he operate, or are we to know?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: Well, he took a great deal of interest in the junior officers. There were
                    a lot of junior officers in the Dominican Republic, and I must say that we
                    probably had as close a relationship with him as anybody I knew. It was all up
                    to him. We didn't know what to do. But he had us all over as groups and as
                    individuals constantly. He included us in so many of the social functions, and
                    he met with us individually and in groups on a regular basis. Goodness, I
                    thought that's what ambassadors were supposed to do. It was only later that I
                    learned that hardly anybody ever did that. So the junior officers in the
                    Dominican Republic had a pretty good relationship and a pretty close
                    relationship with him.</p>
                <p>Q: How did you find your wife reacted to all this? Had she been primed for this
                    before, or was she, as most of the wives do, they come out and all of a sudden,
                    whamo, they're hit in the head with this thing.</p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>TAYLOR: Well, they're hit in the head with it, and I mean, Linda's great. She's a
                    trouper. The government got two for one for close to 30 years from us. I don't
                    know whether the government gets that any more, or should, or maybe even should
                    have in our case, but in any event, she is a real trouper. But over time, you
                    realize that the real burden of Foreign Service life falls on the spouse and on
                    the family. The officer has a job, has a niche, has a set of expectations, has a
                    set of relationships into which to step and to begin immediately. And the
                    spouse, at least in those days, is dropped off in a strange culture, in a
                    strange house, and said, “Good luck” - no car, no money, just “Good luck.” We
                    assume you're going to be happy and successful, and we'll see you in six months
                    or something. And they have to really, then, start from scratch and do it all
                    themselves. Fortunately, I had a spouse who was pretty good at that, pretty
                    flexible, not a whiner and a complainer, and when problems developed, just
                    solved them and went forward.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, now, what was your job when you first arrived?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: When I first arrived, this is very interesting, actually, because they
                    had a new consul general. They had a horrible consular situation there, horrible
                    consular situation, not just in the press of the business, not just in the
                    incidence of fraud, but it was simply totally out of control. Americans did not
                    even control the Consular Section. Mob chaos controlled it. It was totally out
                    of control. And the new consul general, John Diggins - I remember him so well -
                    John Diggins decided that the way to deal with this situation was to have the
                    Ambassador send over all the new junior officers and we were going to have a
                    whole new approach to consular work. And he convinced the Ambassador to do that.
                    None of us wanted to work in the Consular Section, but we all went over, and
                    John Diggins did a great job of leadership, both with respect to his vision
                    about how to take control of the consular situation, but also with his
                    sensitivity to the fact that none of us wished to be there. None of us thought
                    we were going to a consular assignment, and he reached out to each of us
                    personally and to our families and made us feel part of a real team in trying to
                    get on top of this problem. And again, just like with Ambassador Malloy, those
                    of us who were there got off to a lucky start, to be exposed to real leadership
                    and not sort of bureaucratic fumbling, which could have been just as easy in
                    other places, right from the beginning.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, what was the problem in the Consular Section?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>TAYLOR: The problem in the Consular Section was that virtually everybody on the
                    island wanted to go to the United States, and virtually no one could meet the
                    requirements of U.S. law. And so every day the Consular Section was besieged
                    with hundreds and hundreds of people waiting in line, surrounding the section -
                    it was in a separate building from the embassy - trying to get a visa in one way
                    or another. And the waiting room had become in total control of the mob, of the
                    applicants, and the space of control for the consular officers was about the
                    space of this desk, looking out over a waiting room that was just seething with
                    applicants holding fraudulent documents, trying to bribe you, trying any way
                    they could to get to the United States. And so all of that had to be brought
                    under some sort of reasonable control, new management procedures and
                    interviewing procedures and crowd control procedures had to be put in place, and
                    the whole thing just needed about eight step-ups of professionalization. It was
                    just a disgrace. It was a disgrace to the United States, but it was a disgrace
                    to the Dominican Republic and the applicants that we created a situation that
                    allowed that to happen. It was our responsibility to straighten it out, and John
                    Diggins saw that, and he did it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had it been like that for some time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: Yes, it had been like that for a long time?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, how did he go about it? Can you tell his -</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>TAYLOR: Well, first he brought in new people. He wanted new people who hadn't
                    been associated with how it had been. Then he redesigned, physically redesigned
                    the space, moved all the applicants out of what had formerly been their waiting
                    room, and built in, then, waiting and intermediate procedures, where one
                    registered and then went to another station and so forth, finally ended up with
                    an interviewing technique, and to some extent built in an assembly-line
                    procedure, because what was happening is that at eight o'clock every morning
                    there were several hundred applicants, and at five o'clock in the afternoon,
                    when we closed exhausted, there were still several hundred applicants. It just
                    was overwhelming. And he built in this assembly-line technique of a while,
                    through this staging process, that not only kept it under control, but expedited
                    the movement through the system. And we did that for a week. You know, it was
                    very controversial. The Ambassador questioned whether this was treating the
                    applicants correctly or not. We were maybe too much like an assembly line and
                    not enough like a personal interview. But I'll tell you, it was a brilliant
                    thing, because in a week we broke the back of that crowd. We didn't know what
                    the numbers would be, but in a week we ran so many people through that system,
                    that the next day there were only about 10 people waiting. And then the crowds
                    built up during the day. By 5 o'clock there wasn't anybody left, and we could go
                    back, then, to actually under the new procedures, with the new control systems
                    and so forth, we could go back to interviewing people like people, so that week
                    of breaking the back of that overhang of numbers was absolutely essential to
                    getting to the point where we could interview people in a more civilized
                    way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But essentially you were refusing most of the people, is
                        tharight?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: Yes, 99 percent of them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you keep them from coming back?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: We started to have to mark their passports. Instead of just returning
                    them without a visa, we marked them as having been reviewed for a visa. I should
                    tell you also that one of the great - probably not a surprise - one of the great
                    difficulties, complexities of the situation was that so many of our Foreign
                    Service colleagues in the Political Section would send over their friends for a
                    visa, although their friends seemed not the least bit qualified to go, which
                    always led then to great difficulties within the embassy, as these things got
                    kicked upstairs. But you know, what happened was, it wasn't really their
                    friends. Their friends were qualified. It turned out to be the niece of the
                    cousin of the maid of their friends who actually showed up, and they just
                    weren't remotely qualified. But some of these things had to go to the Ambassador
                    to be resolved. You probably know about that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the Foreign Service national?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>TAYLOR: I thought the Foreign Service nationals were very good. I liked them.
                    They did an immense amount of work. I thought they were honest, but
                    unfortunately a couple of years later they were fired for visa fraud, so I think
                    I learned a lot of lessons from that. And I think one of the most important
                    lessons is how much we rely on Foreign Service nationals and how much we have to
                    rely on their integrity, and that to have that, to have that commitment from
                    them, to have that integrity in an environment where they're subject to all
                    sorts of other pressures, it's very important that the American supervisors make
                    them real members of the team. If all they do is treat them like hired hands for
                    six or seven hours a day, then these other pressures that are on them can win. I
                    think it's very important that they be made to feel that they are recognized as
                    real members of the team and that they are appreciated as real members of the
                    team if we are to retain that support and integrity that we need.</p>

                    section about how threatening Cuba was at that time, and even before, in '65, or
                    was Cuba still a major concern.</p>
                <p>TAYLOR: Cuba was still a major concern, although I don't think anyone felt it
                    constituted an immediate threat to the Dominican Republic or to American
                    interests in the Dominican Republic. And I think there was a tremendous
                    awareness throughout the embassy of the importance of growth and development of
                    employment and of peaceful change, land reform and so forth, to producing the
                    kind of system that would have stability and staying power without violent
                    revolution.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing as a political officer?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>TAYLOR: Well, you know, I was doing what you would probably expect, a lot of
                    whatever drops to the bottom, but then in terms of my substantive
                    responsibilities, consistent with my Peace Corps experience and the fact that I
                    liked to out of the embassy and in the countryside meeting people and actually
                    seeing what's going on, I did follow the role of the Church in the Dominican
                    Republic, and I followed agrarian reform and kind of peasant movements in the
                    countryside and local politics outside of the capital, in the interior towns and
                    cities, tried to keep my finger on the pulse of what was, you know, moving
                    politics at that moment.</p>
                <p>Q: Well, how did you find the political system worked? Were there, as in other
                    Latin American countries, you know, the ten families who run things or not, or
                    was this a different breed of cat?</p>
                <p>TAYLOR: Well, it was a slightly different breed of cat. It certainly had the
                    oligarchy and the tip of the iceberg, but it was a country that, again, had just
                    emerged from the very long rule of the Trujillo family, and that period still
                    cast an influence over the whole system. It was a system that was trying to find
                    its legs, in terms of trying to become more democratic and more participatory,
                    but it was a system that had been used to moving on patronage, on a kind of
                    feudal benevolence from powerful patrons and so forth, and so the parties tended
                    to organize themselves along that fashion and distribute goodies to sort of buy
                    votes in that sense.</p>
                <p>Q: Well, how did you adjust? Here you'd been in Colombia where, all power to the
                    people, and you're out, you understand what the real people want, when you're in
                    the Peace Corps and all, and here you are with the embassy and you're getting
                    out in the countryside and all - I mean, was it a little hard to adjust to being
                    as an American official and all that?</p>
                <p>TAYLOR: No, I didn't find it difficult. Maybe it's because some years had passed.
                    I didn't move directly from the Peace Corps to this role. But also, I think,
                    some credit to the leadership of the embassy, which seemed to be big enough, in
                    an intellectual sense, to have room for all sorts of view points and
                    perspectives, and I never felt that the kind of perspective that I tried to
                    introduce into understanding the Dominican political system and how U.S.
                    interests played in all of that, I always found that people welcomed the thing,
                    and what they did with it, that may be a different story, but nobody ever sort
                    of say, you know, we don't like that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the Catholic Church? What role were they
                        playinthere?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>TAYLOR: Well, you know, a mixed one. You had some very traditional members of the
                    institution who lined up as you would think, and at the same time you had some
                    local priests who were borderline revolutionaries, quite frankly, in terms of
                    the agenda that they were pushing at the grassroots level, in terms of land
                    reform, peasant rights, community development, and this sort of thing, and those
                    were the priests that I got to know quite well. Again, it was, I think, easier
                    for me, being that age and coming out of a Peace Corps background, to have
                    relationships with them and for them to have some confidence that I was a person
                    they could deal with and talk with. So in a sense the embassy actually slotted
                    me in exactly the role that I could be most effective in.</p>
                <p>Q: Did you find that, by and large, the political section and the economic
                    section, the more senior officers were captured by the oligarchy or the
                    wealthier people, as so often happens?</p>
                <p>TAYLOR: Not in the Political Section at all. I think the Political Section had a
                    very broad view of what was going on in the Dominican Republic and had good
                    contacts in all segments of the society.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Obviously you're pretty far down the feeding chain -</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: Right at the bottom.</p>
                <p>Q: -but '69 was the arrival of Richard Nixon with his deputy, Henry Kissinger, on
                    the scene. Was there any feel that you were getting from more senior officers
                    that there was a difference?</p>
                <p>TAYLOR: Yes, but I didn't see it. There was no question the more senior officers
                    were talking about Latin America being left out. It didn't fit into Kissinger's
                    world view; it wasn't one of Nixon's priorities. You know, he had a rough time
                    in Latin America in his history.</p>
                <p>Q: He was spat upon.</p>
                <p>TAYLOR: And that may be true in some glorified policy sense back here in
                    Washington, but I never saw it affect anything practical that I worked on or
                    that the people I knew worked on. But I took that on board, and I thought it was
                    probably true in a certain way, but I didn't see it affect my work.</p>
                <p>Q: During this '69-71 period, were there any developments in the Dominican
                    Republic - earthquakes, wars, disasters, Presidential visits, or what have
                    you?</p>
                <p>TAYLOR: There was a major plane crash outside of Santo Domingo. That was the
                    closest thing to the kind of event you're talking about.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get involved in that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: Very much so. The whole embassy got involved. The Ambassador formed a
                    crisis team immediately. There were American citizens on the plane, so the
                    Consular Section was very deeply involved. There was some concern that the crash
                    may have been a terrorist act, at least at first. It turned out not to be the
                    case. But we worked day and night for two days, about 48 hours straight, until
                    the authorities and the system got on top of that, and then after it, all of us
                    who spoke reasonably decent Spanish spent a lot of time canvassing all of the
                    hotels where American citizens might have stayed in order to help identify
                    people who were on the plane or not on the plane at the time, because the
                    passenger list was incomplete and inaccurate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, after '71 you were available. Whither?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: I'll tell you right now I had a very unusual career pattern, Stu, in the
                    sense that I'm sure I'm the only Foreign Service officer who in the first 25
                    years of his or her career only worked one year in Washington.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, it's against the law, for one thing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: Well, you know, laws are made to be broken. In any case, that was my one
                    year. I spent it as a staff assistant in the assistant secretary for Latin
                    American affairs' front office, and then I spent the next 22 years overseas.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now, let's see, you were, what, '71 to '72 a staff
                        assistant -</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: Yes, in ARA. Charlie Meyer was the assistant secretary;John Crimmins was
                    the deputy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did Charlie Meyer, what was his background and how did
                        hoperate?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: Well, he came from Sears, Roebuck. He had a great background in Latin
                    American affairs. He was a very cultured, intelligent, nice gentleman. I was not
                    close to him, but I saw him every day and very much admired his grasp of the
                    issues and his ability to manage the Bureau. I was closer to John Crimmins, who
                    was the chief deputy at the time, and I thought he was one of the most
                    impressive officers that I've ever met in my career.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was a regular Foreign Service officer. What were
                        youresponsibilities?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: Oh, move paper around, write little memos, write things for one of the
                    principals' signatures, to staff them while they were in their offices. Those
                    were the days, you know, before the first oil price run-up, where people worked
                    routinely. They came in at seven in the morning, and they were still there at 11
                    at night, no car pooling, none of that, and so all of us - there were three
                    staff there - we had to spread ourselves out so that we covered that office.
                    Somebody got there before the principals came in, and somebody closed it up
                    after the last one left. And John Crimmins, he was usually there until about 9
                    or 10 every night.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, do you recall any events during this time that sort
                        of gothe attention of people?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: Jeez, there were just - I don't remember a particular crisis. I don't
                    know that one happened in that way at that time, but again this is a period of
                    time in which you have the Cuban situation still, as it is today, unresolved,
                    but then in a Cold War context. You have things like the Panama Canal. You have
                    these various governments teetering around. You have all the border issues with
                    Mexico developing. It's an interesting agenda. At the time it was not a
                    front-page agenda, but it's just full of kind of interesting issues that pop up
                    and present interesting challenges to American foreign policy and the management
                    of those issues at the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get involved in getting papers cleared with other

                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: Oh, yes. I mean that was the stock-in-trade of a stafassistant.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find this process?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: Well, I told you that I only worked one year out of my first 25 in
                    Washington. That's the answer to that question. I discovered quickly that I
                    loved government issues and I hate government work. I hate bureaucracy. And I
                    decided I was going to work in the place where I could spend the most time on
                    the issues, which is out in the field, and the least amount of time on clearing
                    papers and fighting about words and that sort of thing. So my whole career
                    pattern is the definitive answer to that question.</p>

                <p>TAYLOR: Well, Yugoslavia had always been a keen interest of mine,ever since I
                    read Rebecca West's books, many-</p>

                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: That's it. That did it to me, just caught me, captivated me, had to go
                    there, had to see that place, had to be part of it. And it's also a place, at
                    the time, that I though, in microcosm, to be sure, just had all of the
                    interesting international issues. It had the East-West issues, and it had a
                    special role. It had the north-south issues, and then the internal politics were
                    absolutely fascinating and so full of history and culture and conflict. So this
                    was just a place where I thought I could enjoy it every day, and I did, I really
                    liked it very much.</p>

                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: I took Serbo-Croatian. I know today that it's Serbian,Croatian, Bosnian -
                    but it was Serbo-Croatian at the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was that? For a year or about 10 months?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: 10 months, yes. Q: Did you have Popovic and Jankovic?</p>
                <p>TAYLOR: I did. I had Jankovic and Milosevic. Father Milosevic wathe second
                    teacher at the time.</p>
                <p>

                        what weryou getting from your teachers and all about Yugoslavia?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>TAYLOR: Very valuable lesson, although I think some people were a little angry
                    about it at the time. What I got was an interpretation of World War II, and
                    maybe the year after the war, 1946. Actually, while it seemed to be ridiculous,
                    that's still what drives every... That's why they're still killing each other.
                    So it turned out to be a very valuable lesson in what actually motivates the
                    people that live in that tormented little country, or set of countries.</p>
                <p>Q: I had both Jankovic and Popovic, Popovic even more, and I got the same thing.
                    I mean, I got the Serbian point of view. I was given the book Genocide in
                    Satellite Serbia or something like that -</p>
                <p>TAYLOR: Yes.</p>
                <p>Q: -and all this which has served me to understand the Serbs more. I mean,
                    Popovic was saying, was taking great pride on the Salonika front during World
                    War I that they didn't kill people with bullets. If they caught a traitor they
                    killed him with an axe. And I thought, uh-oh.</p>
                <p>TAYLOR: You're right. And I always felt very fortunate, though, Stu, that I
                    served in both Zagreb and Belgrade because serving in Zagreb opened my eyes to
                    things that you can' get either from our language instructors of the day or from
                    experience in Belgrade. For one thing, you knew immediately that this country
                    was not holding together. When I went to Belgrade, everybody in the embassy
                    thought, well, Yugoslavia is doing pretty well, and when I went there, I said,
                    well, I can see what you're saying but, you know, I live in Zagreb, and when
                    you're there, talking to people, building relationships, getting beneath the
                    surface, it's very clear they all still hate each other. Now it's controlled,
                    but some day this genie is going to get out of the bottle. It hasn't been
                    solved; it's just been contained. When you were in Belgrade you thought the
                    system was working. There were Yugoslavs. Well, maybe there were, but there
                    weren't any in Croatia, I'll tell you that. So that service in Zagreb really
                    gave me an insight that unfortunately the embassy and the people who only worked
                    in Belgrade, even if they'd been there for two or three tours, never really
                    could understand because it looked like it was working.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We've already alluded to it, but how did you find your
                        firsimpressions in Zagreb of the people and the system and all that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: Well, I just thought it was fascinating, and I was really up for this
                    assignment. It was what I had wanted. I thought I was just so lucky to have a
                    job that sent me to a place this fascinating, that had given me language
                    training and so forth, so I went in there on a real emotional high, and I just
                    loved it. I didn't have a set of expectations about the system, but I liked the
                    people, and the people liked Americans. That was absolutely clear, and so that
                    was a big advantage. But what struck me most about the place, again, was the
                    weight of history, but this time it was quite a negative weight of history, and
                    the sense of ethnic hatred and dislike. And I remember I had so many
                    conversations with visiting American scholars who were writing books on
                    Yugoslavia who were claiming that Yugoslavia was going to work, that the
                    workers' self-management and the Yugoslav identity had solved a lot of problems
                    and opened new doors, and they were quoting all the time the statistics on
                    inter-ethnic marriage and so forth. And I just kept saying all the time, I would
                    say, “Well, I hear what you're saying, but I live here, you know, and it doesn't
                    seem that way to me. That's not what I hear at night. That's not what I hear
                    when I talk with these people. That's not what I hear when I sit in a restaurant
                    or in a caf�. They really don't like each other very much, you know.” But there
                    was an international industry at the time that was convinced and wrote a lot of
                    books about, you know, how Yugoslavia was the new model and was and would
                    continue to be successful.</p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>I'll tell you, one interesting [language] vignette was, because again, I was
                    still young enough and still oriented toward trying to get out and network and
                    meet people and not stay in the office all the time, so when my car came to the
                    port of Rijeka, instead of having it delivered, as was normal, I told the
                    Administrative Section, I'll get on the train, I'm going to go down and pick it
                    up and drive it up here myself, because that will give me experience of going on
                    the train, going through the... So I went down there and I did, and I had to
                    have the help of - there was some nice customs expediter down there, not from
                    the Consulate but from the port, who took pity on me and helped me get the car
                    and everything. So I took him out to lunch to thank him for the car, and I still
                    remember him saying to me, after lunch was over and I was getting ready to get
                    in my car and drive it back to Zagreb, he said, “Mister Taylor, you speak
                    Serbo-Croatian wonderfully, but you speak it like a book.” And it rang true to
                    me. I mean I was just drawing this stuff right out of the textbook. It was a
                    wonderful comment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the consular problems that you had?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: Consular problems there were not visa problems. The visa thing was fairly
                    orderly. Most people either clearly could or couldn't go, and we were in
                    control. It wasn't anything like the Dominican Republic, and in fact I had a
                    vice consul and a Foreign Service national that did most of the visa work, and
                    it was only a few cases that I had to become involved in. The interesting cases
                    were welfare and whereabouts, American citizens. Some of them were quite normal
                    - young people run out of money or gotten sick on the Dalmatian coast, and how
                    can you help them. There were a lot of American citizens in the Consular
                    District. They were originally born in Yugoslavia, had emigrated to the United
                    States, and come back to live on their Social Security payments in a place where
                    [Social Security checks] went a lot further than they did in the U.S. And they
                    needed some care and feeding, and then, of course, some of them would eventually
                    pass away, and then there would be a death thing.</p>
                <p>Now a couple of things there. You know, this was 1973 or '74. It was amazing. I
                    wish I'd been doing oral history, Stu, at the time, because I had American
                    citizens come into my office, elderly ones, who had been born in the Turkish
                    Empire, or who had been Sarajevo in 1914, when the archduke was assassinated,
                    and then had emigrated to the United States and were telling me what Los Angeles
                    was like in 1921, and then had come back to the Yugoslavia of the day. The
                    richness of this historical texture was just unbelievable, but of course it's
                    all gone now, and we didn't capture it. No one captured it, and it's gone. What
                    a loss.</p>
                <p>Q: I had one man came in and said, “Well, I worked as a torpedo in Chicago,” for
                    maybe it was Al Capone or something, you know, a killer for one of the mobs.
                    Another one worked in a “blind pig,” which is slang for a speakeasy - a “blind
                    pig,” and I was mentally searching and I finally remembered some obscure
                    reference and knew it was a Prohibition bar.</p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>TAYLOR: There are fascinating, just fascinating, things, just so full of
                    interesting characters and this rich history. And then, I'll tell you, there's
                    this one consular case, fascinating. This American citizen, born in Croatia but
                    was an American citizen, was caught entering Yugoslavia, crossed the border
                    illegally, carrying weapons and a Ustashi uniform, and so he was arrested as a
                    terrorist. So eventually I was notified and I went there. It turns out I was
                    absolutely convinced the guy was nuts - this was far from being a terrorist, he
                    was mentally unbalanced - and so then initiated a long process to get him out of
                    jail and under some sort of medical supervision, which I finally prevailed in.
                    And then he was transferred to this medical facility for examination and so
                    forth - that was in Zagreb - and so I would go see him once a week and bring him
                    some chocolate or something like that and talk to him. Now this guy, you know,
                    was just absolutely totally off the wall politically, but he was mentally
                    unbalanced, and not a terrorist, he was just mentally unbalanced. But I can tell
                    you this, and this is the eye-opener for me: when he talked about domestic
                    Yugoslav politics and about World War II and what it meant to the country, he
                    sounded just like everybody else. He sounded like the prime minister. He sounded
                    like the bishop. He sounded like the college professor. They're all lunatics
                    about that - which unfortunately explains a lot about what has gone on. That
                    region has produced more history than it has consumed.</p>
                <p>Q: Well, did you have any problems, particularly in Germany but even more so in
                    Sweden, of sort of these Croatian nationalists left over from World War II who
                    were terrorists, and they were trying to mess around in Croatia. Did you get any
                    reflection of that?</p>
                <p>TAYLOR: No, they had peaked out just before I got there. They had, I don't know,
                    kidnapped a plane or blown it up. That was kind of their last hurrah, and
                    fortunately they sort of disappeared off the landscape, but there was a little
                    bit of a legacy in that any time you flew on the Yugoslav airline for all the
                    time I was there, because of those things, all the baggage was lined up as you
                    got on the plane, and no bag was ever put on that plane unless a person said,
                    “That's my bag.”</p>
                <p>Q: In November I took Croatian Airlines, and you could not have anything with
                    batteries in it in your stowed luggage. You could carry it in your suitcase, and
                    I tell you, you'd never - you know how many batteries you have, for flashlights,
                    cameras, and all that, and the sweat that poured out of me, thinking, My God,
                    have I got them all? I mean they're still obviously nervous about this type of
                    thing. Did you get any feel for the Church? Was the Catholic Church important at
                    all at that point?</p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>TAYLOR: Oh, it was very important. It was very important, and the mixture of the
                    religion with Croatian nationalism in people's minds was extremely important.
                    Again, this is one of the things that still, at that time and I guess today, is
                    a factor in setting Serbs and Croatians off with each other, because the
                    Croatians really look to the Church as a foundation of their society, their
                    culture, and their legitimacy; and the Serbs are, as you know from your own
                    experience, the first thing that will be out of their mouth is how the prelate
                    of the Catholic Church walks down the steps of the Cathedral when the Nazis
                    march in and puts a garland of flowers around the Nazi general and then proceeds
                    to support the extermination of Serbs. Is that really true? No one asks if it is
                    reality or nonsense.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you hear about the massacre at Glina-</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: Exactly, so it's a very divisive factor between Serbs and Croats still
                    today, but the Croatians very much look to the Church as an integral part of
                    their system, their state, and their society.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: On the protection and welfare side, did you have any
                        problemwith the Autoput and automobile accidents?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: Never had an automobile accident. The Autoput was littereusually with
                    Turkish drivers and passengers. Unbelievable.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Turkish consul general said he was just . . . because
                        thewould buy their car after working in Germany and drive it day and
                        night.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: No sleep, just drive it back and forth. And you know hobad that road is.
                    One, there is no passing lane. There are no lights.</p>

                <p>TAYLOR: And horses and cattle just everywhere. And so the place was littered with
                    Turkish automobile accidents. There was never an American automobile accident.
                    We had, again, a number of American welfare and whereabouts cases along the
                    coast. We did have an American citizen that was of Lebanese descent, but he was
                    an American citizen who was jailed, and then when he got out on bond, hid
                    himself in the trunk of his wife's car and drove out to Trieste, and
                    successfully. They didn't open the trunk of the car. The Italians opened it,
                    however, within sight of the Yugoslav guards, and were surprised to discover him
                    in the trunk, which led to a massive Yugoslav effort to retrieve him, both
                    immediately on the spot, but then when that failed, subsequently through
                    diplomatic channels. I was unfortunately involved in that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What happened? Did they ever get him back?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: No.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, I didn't think so. What was your impression of how
                        Tito waviewed at that particular juncture?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: You know we had a Croatian friend. She was of Hungarian descent. Her
                    family had lost everything in the Communist revolution. They had been part of a
                    very wealthy oligarchy. Members of her family were killed. All of their land and
                    houses had been taken away from them. So she worked as a translator, and she
                    spoke several languages and made a nice little life for herself, but wasn't part
                    of the system. She hated the Communist system; she hated Tito; she hated
                    everything about it. One day, she came in, and every once in a while, a rumor
                    would go around that Tito was sick and about to die. Well, it came around. Tito
                    was sick and about to die, and this time it was on the news and people thought
                    it was real. And she came running in to see me. She said, “Mister Taylor, Tito's
                    going to die. What are we going to do? What are we going to do?” So here it is,
                    you see. Here it is, this woman who hates everything about him and his system
                    can't imagine what life would be without him. So by this time, he's such an
                    established part, such a dominant part of the life and the stability of a system
                    that's so potentially unstable, that even those who hate him realize that he may
                    be indispensable.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you sense at that point - I mean, it was a pretty

                <p>TAYLOR: Yes, one thing I mentioned earlier is we saw the country and the issues
                    from a somewhat different perspective. From the capital of the country, from the
                    heart of Serbia in Belgrade, it seemed like the system was not just alive and
                    well - it certainly was, I wouldn't disagree with that - but somehow had
                    successfully mastered the ethnic tensions and hatreds and conflict and cultural
                    clashes that historically have been present in those societies. And sitting out
                    where we were, we knew that that was not the case.</p>
                <p>That was one thing. Now there had been something called a “Croatian Spring,” a
                    couple of years earlier, named after the “Prague Spring” of '68. And in the
                    Croatian Spring of '71-72, the genie of Croatian nationalism had almost gotten
                    out of the bottle down there in Zagreb. There was this one terribly emotional
                    moment in which at the opera, at the opera house in Zagreb. Croatians love music
                    and opera. You know, they think of themselves, really, as part of the
                    Austrian-Hungarian tradition. They're not part of the Orthodox Church. They're
                    Catholic, they use the Latin alphabet, they're part of Europe, thank you very
                    much - not like the Serbs, who are part of Asia and Orthodoxism and all of this,
                    in their minds. And they love opera, and at one of these operas, for the first
                    time in the Communist period - it's an opera about the Turks besieging, it may
                    have been Vienna or it may have been another, I can't remember which town it was
                    - and as the Christians sally forth to do battle on stage, for the first time in
                    the Communist period, unfurled was the old Croatian flag.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, boy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: And it was such a shock. And the reaction was immediate. The entire
                    audience rose to its feet and cheered and cheered and cheered. This sent tremors
                    throughout the whole system, it was such a natural, spontaneous, but very real
                    view into what was beneath the surface there. Anyhow, as the system got control
                    of the Croatian Spring, the embassy to some extent got control of the consulate
                    general as well, and the consulate general, which during that earlier period had
                    sent political reporting in under its own name, had been asked to send in most
                    political reporting through the embassy, so that the embassy could provide
                    comment on it.</p>
                <p>Q: Ah, yes, well, when I was in Belgrade, '62-67, towards the end I found myself
                    telling my colleagues in Zagreb, I said, “Yes maybe this is so, but you weren't
                    500 years under the Turkish yoke,” which is what the Serbs say. And I mean, my
                    God, it permeates.</p>
                <p>TAYLOR: It permeates everything, I know. It was very interesting to be in Zagreb,
                    and then to be in Belgrade and really be able to see the country from both
                    perspectives.</p>
                <p>Q: While you were in Zagreb, did you run across people who were trying to escape
                    from East Germany, Czechoslovakia? So many would sort of come down for the
                    summer. They could get there and all that. And then many of them looked towards
                    getting the hell out.</p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>TAYLOR: Right. No, we didn't see any of those. We knew what was going on, and of
                    course, Yugoslavs could travel freely. I mean there were hundreds of thousands
                    working as guest workers in Germany. This was one of the safety valves of the
                    system, both the people could leave if they wished to, but also that they could
                    earn money and do well and bring it back into the country and help their
                    families. We knew these other nationalities were coming down there and in that
                    environment trying to exit. We didn't see them applying for American visas or
                    deal with them directly. Occasionally we had a Palestinian passport or so show
                    up at the Consulate trying to get a visa. Of course, at that time that was not
                    possible to do.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, in '74, you went to Belgrade. What were you doing

                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: I was doing the kind of mainstream economic reporting frothe embassy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was our Ambassador at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: Malcolm Toon.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find him?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: He's one of the superstars of the system, as you know, and he was
                    brilliant. He was also a rather distant and shy personality, from me and most of
                    the staff. So while I very much respected him, I was not close to him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the DCM [deputy chief of mission]?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: Of course, Toon was succeeded by Lawrence Silberman, whom I worked for as
                    well. Then the DCM was Dudley Miller, and then when Dudley left, there was kind
                    of a strange situation in which a friend of Ambassador Silberman's seemed to
                    become the DCM.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why don't we talk about the Ambassador first? How did you
                        finSilberman as ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: Well, Silberman is very controversial. I have to say that two of my
                    friends there, Dudley Miller and Ken Hill, were very much mistreated, and as a
                    result of that, that colors my impression because I don't like what happened to
                    them. It was not fair, and it was more than unfortunate, it was just wrong. On
                    the other hand, Ambassador Silberman and I, for some strange reason, got along
                    very well, and in my personal dealings with him, I actually enjoyed him.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I know Dudley because he was in the Economic Section when
                        I wain Belgrade. What happened to Dudley and Ken Hill?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: Well, let me tell you something funny, Stu. You know I'm retired to
                    Gettysburg, right? My retirement home's in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. Well,
                    Dudley Miller lives about five miles away from me, and Ken Hill lives about a
                    mile away from me, so the three of us, that old Belgrade group is right up there
                    in Gettysburg.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We'll work to get them interviewed. But how did it come
                        out?What happened, and so on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: Well, Silberman essentially fired Dudley, and that led to a situation, I
                    think, where Dudley retired prematurely from the Foreign Service. I think he
                    would have been, and should have been, an ambassador and somehow got sidetracked
                    there and left. I think it's very unfortunate and very unfair. Ken Hill, I
                    think, had a very rough time and left Belgrade prematurely and in an unfair
                    situation that followed him around for a few years. But Ken stayed around and
                    eventually became ambassador to Bulgaria and did an extremely good job and then
                    did a wonderful job at the Marshall Center, the new Marshall Center in Garmisch,
                    as the State Department representative there in terms of training - primarily
                    military but some civilian officials of the newly independent states of the
                    former Soviet Union. So Ken went on to a very distinguished and successful
                    career.</p>
                <p>Q: When Silberman came he was what, he wasn't a judge at that time; he was a
                    lawyer, wasn't he? Did you get a feel for, what was his attitude when he came
                    there?</p>
                <p>TAYLOR: His attitude about what?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Towards diplomatic life, the embassy, and Yugoslavia.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>TAYLOR: Well, first of all, he's a very smart guy. He's a very bright guy, and
                    he's a very energetic guy. I think he's full of self-confidence and felt that we
                    had a lot to learn from him, perhaps. I think he wanted to do, and did do in
                    some ways, a very strong and good job with the Yugoslavs. He wanted to establish
                    a relationship with them, but he was a tough guy, and he wanted to establish
                    kind of a tough love relationship with them; and in one case, which was the case
                    of a dual citizen, who had gone back there - Silberman was extraordinarily
                    aggressive and successful in standing up for American citizen interests. He took
                    on the Yugoslav system in a way where a lot of ambassadors wouldn't have, and
                    really staked everything on his fight for the right treatment of this American
                    citizen. There was just, I think, a lot of unfortunate mistakes made by many of
                    us that led to situations in which a couple of very fine friends and officers
                    got unfair wrong treatment, and unfortunately it's hard for me not to see things
                    through that legacy, because I like those people and know how they were wrongly
                    treated. But again, trying to separate that, I think Silberman did a strong job.
                    He did and aggressive job. And, in my personal dealing with him, I found him
                    interesting, and he treated me fairly.</p>
                <p>Q: I remember reading from afar, but as a former chief of the Consular Section in
                    Belgrade not too far past, watching him trying to get this American out.</p>
                <p>TAYLOR: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was saying bravo, because I did feel that most
                        professional ambassadors wouldn't have taken that course. There was always
                        something else to deal with, and so the tendency to throw somebody in
                        trouble, to leave that and not really make it as a commitment.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: No, as I said, he deserved very high marks for that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression - you were an economic officer -
                        of theconomy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: I thought the Yugoslav economy of the day was quite good, in large part
                    because of the foreign workers and their remittances - it was a tremendous boon
                    to the system - but also because this was the heyday of the growing tourist
                    industry. The Dalmatian coast was being opened. Germans, but other Western
                    Europeans, were coming there in increasing numbers, and so the tourist earnings
                    were also quite good. It seemed to me that internally, worker self-management
                    was not as successful as outside academic experts thought it was, and that the
                    country, despite its socialist ideology and philosophy, the reality was that the
                    country itself had serious class splits, serious urban-agrarian splits, and
                    serious north-south splits, in which Croatia and Slovenia were doing very well,
                    thank you, and Macedonia, the Kosovo, and Montenegro were very much
                    third-worldish and 19th-century, when you traveled through.</p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>Q: There was the charge, later during the split, about 15 years or so later, that
                    one of the feelings in Slovenia and Croatia was that they're taking all our
                    money and dumping it in Macedonia and Montenegro and all, and we want our own
                    money.</p>
                <p>TAYLOR: Well, that was the price of being one country, that there was some
                    redistribution that had to be made in order to keep everybody on board, and that
                    they were paying more in taxes than they were getting back was certainly true.
                    In the end they didn't wish to be part of one country and maybe the others
                    didn't either. There was not that natural, genuine sense of identity. I always
                    felt, Stu - I don't know how you felt - I felt there was a kind of a Yugoslav
                    man and woman, but that, that sense of identity, of being Yugoslav, was limited
                    to the generation that fought with Tito. They truly had transcended their ethnic
                    conflicts. They became Yugoslavs in their outlooks and in their self-identities,
                    but even though they came to dominate the system, to control the education and
                    the schools, to control the churches, to control everything, they could not pass
                    that sense of identity on, even to their own children. And so it wasn't what was
                    going to happen when Tito died, although that was an important question. The
                    more fundamental question, what was going to happen to that country when that
                    generation passed through and there was no one left who was a Yugoslav and the
                    identity then would fracture? And I think that's precisely what happened.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any thought that, if Yugoslavia splits, there
                        would ba Bosnian state?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: No, not at the time I was there. People did not think of Bosnia as a
                    genuine state at the time I was there. That was kind of a no-man's-land between
                    Croatia and Serbia and was not thought of as having its own natural identity as
                    a state.</p>
                <p>Q: I know, as I say, last November, I went there as an election observer and
                    started saying, I'm sorry, I don't speak very good Serbian, and they said,
                    “You're speaking beautiful Bosnian!” Were we looking at Kosovo at the time?</p>
                <p>TAYLOR: We were. We were very well aware at the embassy that Kosovo was a
                    potential flash point, that the demographic trends were working to a situation
                    in which the Serbs would become such an increasing minority that it would be
                    very hard to see how they could continue to control the province effectively,
                    and at the same time, given the Serbian sense of soul and history, that the
                    Serbian state was rooted there and that the glories of Kosovo Polje were
                    something integral to Serbia that they would never let it go. And we covered
                    that. We all traveled to the Kosovo. We looked at that, the embassy, there was
                    an officer there, Jim Shoemaker, did some very interesting reporting on the
                    university in Pristina in Kosovo and Albanian nationalism, so that was not
                    something that to the people who were there unnoticed. It may have been
                    unnoticed in Washington - I don't know - but that was something that Ambassador
                    Toon and Ambassador Silberman were very much aware of.</p>

                <p>TAYLOR: At a personal level it was quite easy, but at a professional level it was

                    some way, and that always opened doors. But, you know, what we really were
                    trying to do, with Ex-Im, we were trying to increase American exports to the
                    country and have a very active export-import program at the time.</p>

                <p>TAYLOR: Yes, there was some of it, mainly around big projects. It wasn't as

                    projects, yes. We were certainly tremendously aggressive on the Krsko Nuclear
                    Power Plant. Whether this was in retrospect something we should have been so
                    aggressive about, I think there might be some lessons to be learned from that,
                    but at the time, the companies involved and the U.S. government felt that it was
                    right to really pound away and try to make sure that project was an American
                    project.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>TAYLOR: I might not be the best person to answer that question, although I did do
                    some work on it looking into, for example, the defense industry base in
                    Yugoslavia and, certainly, at the very large amount of infrastructure in caves
                    and underground they had put in place in Bosnia in the mountains and so forth. I
                    tended to see it as no so much of a threat. I was more interested in how the
                    Yugoslavs created a deterrent or an ability to deal with an eventuality that
                    might or might not occur, even though I thought it was unlikely to occur. So my
                    focus was really on Yugoslav preparedness, rather than on estimating the degree
                    of a Soviet threat. To the extent that I saw a Soviet threat through my contacts
                    and through my activities, it was not through military attack but through trying
                    to use economic propaganda, intelligence assets, in order to shift, within the
                    Yugoslav government, within the system, thinking in favor of the Soviet Union's
                    position on key international issues.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, economically speaking, did the Soviets have
                        anythinparticular to offer the Yugoslavians?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: No. They didn't have much to offer themselves either. But the thing is,
                    when you get into command systems like that, and it certainly didn't have
                    anything to offer on a long term basis, I don't believe, but on any individual
                    day or week, a barter system could be created that had some advantages, so you
                    could manipulate, using a barter system, issues to your advantage. But in terms
                    of building a future, I think the Yugoslavs had decided that looking east was
                    not their economic future.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think one of our concerns when I was there, at least it
                        was a concern I had - I didn't lie awake at night thinking about it, but -
                        the basic thing was that if Yugoslavia falls apart, this gives an
                        opportunity for the Soviets to come in and meddle.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: Oh, yes.</p>
                <p>Q: We will not stand for that, and so this could be the equivalent to another
                    Berlin, as far as a flash point. And I think that, you know, there was wishful
                    thinking - (maybe it wasn't even wishful thinking - it was probably practical
                    thinking) that everybody wanted to keep Yugoslavia together-</p>
                <p>TAYLOR: That's correct. Oh, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: -at that point. And it was only with the disappearance of
                        thSoviet threat, in a way, that allowed the place to fall apart.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>TAYLOR: Yes. I don't think there's any doubt that the disintegration of the
                    Yugoslav state, had it occurred in a context in which the Soviet Union remained
                    a global contender with the United States, would be far more worrisome, far more
                    dangerous to our interests in Europe and around the world than the
                    disintegration of the Yugoslav state in the context where the Soviet system
                    itself has lost power and come apart. Again, my own feeling on that was that, as
                    long as Tito or as long as his generation that we discussed earlier was still in
                    control of the system, that state would not come apart, and my own feeling was
                    that it couldn't help but come apart after they had passed, no matter what the
                    international environment was, because the centrifugal forces were just too
                    strong once that restraining generation was no longer there.</p>

                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>TAYLOR: Well, first of all, neither of them were Yugoslavs. I've already said
                    that. They were Serbs and they were Croatians, okay? Very important. Secondly,
                    the Croatians hungered for something different, and the younger Serbs hungered,
                    I think, for Serb hegemony. It wasn't going to be a Yugoslav system, but they
                    certainly imagined a system in which they would remain in charge. But both
                    younger generations were increasingly international in their outlook. That is,
                    although they carried this historical weight and all this mythology about each
                    other and about World War II, they also knew about a wider world and knew that
                    it had some importance in their lives. So there was a generational shift in that
                    sort of awareness. And many of them had traveled, at least to West Germany or
                    Italy, and so they had seen, they had experienced a whole different way of life.
                    They had seen prosperity. They had seen democracy. They may not have understood
                    how you did that sort of thing, but they knew the word was different from
                    Belgrade and Zagreb and what was going on in their own country. And they were in
                    other ways just like young people. They were more adventuresome. They were more
                    flexible. But still, they had all of that mythology about each other. This
                    terribly distorted historical memory is deeply embedded in most everyone.</p>

                <p>TAYLOR: Well, we did have a couple of visits by SecretarKissinger. We had a visit

                <p>TAYLOR: They went very well. Secretary Kissinger was very tough with the
                    Yugoslavs, as he should be. President Ford was very diplomatic and effective
                    with them. Tito was still alive. The Cold War was still going on, and Yugoslavia
                    had an importance in the diplomatic environment, and I think our policy at that
                    time was right and it was very effectively done.</p>

                <p>TAYLOR: I went to a year of economic training at Harvard.</p>
                <p>Q: Could you talk about how you found the training and also something about the
                    outlook of the faculty and the fit between the academic world and the Foreign
                    Service world.</p>
                <p>TAYLOR: Okay. First the training was excellent, but it was excellent because we
                    made it excellent. It didn't happen by spontaneous combustion. I think it was
                    the responsibility of all of us who were on that program to search out the right
                    professors, the right courses, that fit into our career development and to use
                    the opportunities in that way. It could have been a wasted although enjoyable
                    year if we simply had taken a set of curriculum offered through the graduate
                    schools at Harvard without critical thought about which of those opportunities
                    supported our career development and our future work in the Department.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're saying “we.” Could you explain how this was
                        structured?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>TAYLOR: Well, it was through FSI and through the mid-level training division of
                    PER, but at that time in the Department we were sending five or six officers
                    through this program each year, and so there were four or five colleagues with
                    me.</p>
                <p>Q: You weren't just lost in the groves academiae; I mean, there were people who
                    had gone before you and after, so you kind of knew, there was some guideline to
                    what would make sense.</p>
                <p>TAYLOR: I don't think so. Again, I think each of us had to look at ourselves
                    personally, our own strengths and weaknesses and our own aspirations to the
                    future and try to fit that all in to an incredibly rich and diverse and deep
                    menu of opportunities offered up there. I was the only one that I know of then,
                    before (and I don't know about after), but I was the only one of the groups that
                    I knew personally who took courses not just at Harvard but also at MIT and at
                    the Fletcher School. It was hard, because of the logistics of getting around to
                    all of those and meeting one's responsibilities, but the extra opportunities
                    involved were immensely valuable to me. Now on the point of the fit, again, I
                    think you had to work at it. You had a natural advantage. We were older; we were
                    more mature; and we brought a set of experiences that could be interesting to
                    the university environment. But again, it won't happen by spontaneous
                    combustion. I think we each had to make an extra effort to meet our faculty, to
                    meet the administration of the graduate schools, and to establish personal
                    relationships. And as valuable as that year of academic training was, Stu, I can
                    tell you, the most valuable thing that came out it, from a career point of view
                    for me, was that set of personal contacts that I made with the faculty and with
                    the administration, because it turned out that I saw those people again and
                    again over the next ten years on my job. A whole set of them were advisers to
                    the Indonesian government during the years that I was posted to Indonesia, and
                    two of them became very senior officials in the Canadian government during the
                    time that I was posted to Canada. And being able to draw on that personal
                    relationship established during that year of training was a great advantage in
                    doing my work, both in Jakarta and then later in Canada.</p>

                <p>Q: You say you had to figure out what your goals, aspirations are. When you went
                    there, what were you pointed toward, and then could you talk about how it
                    went?</p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>TAYLOR: Yes, see, I knew exactly what I wanted to do. I already had a master's
                    degree in economics, so I had a nice foundation. What I wanted to do was develop
                    a specialty in the geopolitics of oil and gas and to work on international
                    petroleum, natural gas, and energy issues in an environment that had already
                    gone through the first oil price shock of 1973 and in which I was fairly
                    confident there would be another one, as there was. And I wanted to niche myself
                    for a bit of my mid-career in that specialty, and I thought that I needed more
                    training in order to really perform well. And that's why I took that full
                    spectrum of courses through those three universities instead of just the courses
                    that were offered at Harvard. And it was a tremendous year for that, again, in
                    terms of building informational and analytical expertise, but also in building
                    personal relationships that would be valuable later.</p>
                <p>Q: With the faculty, did you find that most of them had acted as consultants? I
                    mean, did they understand the real world rather than the theoretical world?</p>
                <p>TAYLOR: The ones I worked with sure did, and they had a lot of consultancies with
                    foreign governments and with Washington, and many of them were on what, at the
                    time, seemed to be a revolving door between Cambridge up north and appointments
                    down here in Washington. Now they got shut out because they mainly traveled in
                    Democratic political circles, and beginning in 1980 the Republicans had the
                    White House for a while; but at the time I was there, they were in and out of
                    the Carter administration and intended to be an important part of the American
                    government as well as an important part of academia.</p>

                    the entire Foreign Service, in terms of the range of responsibility, the
                    interest, and the relevance of the work. So it was a great country, it was a

                <p>TAYLOR: '80.</p>
                <p>Q: Okay, first could we talk about Indonesia in 1977, when you arrived? How did
                    the country strike you, and then what were American relations with the Suharto
                    government?</p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>TAYLOR: Well, the country is striking in many ways, and it is a unique,
                    wonderful, but very foreign culture to a North American, full of fascinating
                    history, values, ideas, and actions, some of which at first glance seemed a bit
                    strange. The contrast between wealth and poverty hits you the minute you walk
                    off the plane and on the drive in from the airport. It's a contrast that I had
                    seen before. I saw it in Yugoslavia, I saw it in the Dominican Republic, and I
                    lived with it while I was in the Peace Corps. But I can tell you, at the time we
                    had a big AID program, and we brought in many contractors, and some of the
                    contractors that we brought in were experts on agriculture or finance or some
                    area in which we assisting Indonesia but had never been out of the United States
                    before. They turned around and went home in the first hour, and part of the
                    reason they turned around and went home - it didn't happen often, but it
                    happened - was because on the ride in from the airport they simply experienced a
                    culture shock of proportions that they could not cope with and decided that they
                    had to leave. And what they saw was, living right by the road, just very
                    desperate sort of poverty that they had never encountered before. So that was
                    one of the striking features. It's also a very colorful place and a very
                    beautiful place in terms of natural beauty.</p>
                <p>I was fortunate, Stu, that my job took me to every corner of Indonesia. It's a
                    big place. It's an archipelago. You know, it's a lot of water, by definition,
                    but it's almost as wide as the United States, when you go from the tip of upper
                    Sumatra, swing out through Irinjaya. And my job included networking with the
                    entire international oil community, mainly American companies, not exclusively,
                    who were there, and they were in all parts of Indonesia, and I got to visit all
                    parts of Indonesia on a regular basis. So you saw the immense amount of
                    diversity that went beyond the dominant Javanese culture, which is what most of
                    the people in the embassy experienced during their time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the ambassador when you arrived?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: When I arrived it was David Newsom, and he was then shortlreplaced by Ed
                    Masters.</p>
                <p>Q: Well, now, what was your impression - you've been in a number of embassies -
                    what was your impression of the embassy, not only how it functioned but how well
                    plugged in was it to the powers that be in Indonesia?</p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>TAYLOR: That embassy was extremely well plugged in and had been for a long time
                    and remains plugged in today. And that is because of the close association the
                    United States has had with President Suharto since he assumed power in the
                    '65-66-67 period. There were many, and I guess still are many, former U.S.
                    government officials who after their retirement took jobs consulting on
                    Indonesia or with Indonesian organizations or with American organizations
                    connected to Indonesia and who continued to exert quite an important influence
                    over relationships, and who worked closely with the embassy, who were there to
                    talk with the embassy and to share insights. It was a very, very close
                    relationship - and the United States benefited from it immensely in so many
                    ways. Indonesia did many things throughout the last 30 years, including the
                    Vietnam period and other sensitive periods, in support of U.S. interests, at the
                    request of the U.S. government, that would be above and beyond the expected in a
                    normal relationship. So we've profited immensely in a number of ways - economic,
                    commercial, political, strategic - from our association with Indonesia, but here
                    we stand now, in 1997, perhaps toward the sunset of the Suharto era, at a time
                    when Southeast Asia, and specifically Indonesia, has gone through an economic
                    meltdown that is associated with the structural type of economies and crony
                    capitalism and this sort of thing. And I think, looking back, we also have to
                    ask ourselves whether we have been able to maintain the necessary sort of
                    political distance from that government in order to be sure that we were
                    correctly assessing and shaping U.S. interests at all times.</p>
                <p>Q: What about it, when you arrived there and first took a look at it? You
                    immersed yourself in oil economics and all, but before we look at developments
                    there, let's look at how you looked at the structure of the government. Was the
                    Indonesian government dealing with its oil program well at that time, or was it
                    just sort of being enhanced because there was oil there?</p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>TAYLOR: It's a complicated answer. In the first instance, Indonesia had pioneered
                    a unique method, at the time, of partnership with the much-needed foreign
                    expertise and companies. That was called a “production-sharing” arrangement.
                    Basically, sovereignty over the natural resource was retained by the government
                    of Indonesia at the same time that contractual conditions were fashioned as
                    incentives that enticed foreign oil companies, and especially American oil
                    companies, into the country in a big way to promote development and ultimately
                    to promote production. Indonesia had gone through a huge wave of that, based on
                    those unique contractual features, and had established a very sizable production
                    base by the time I had arrived. What was missing at the time was a system, a
                    professional system of deep expertise within Indonesia itself and an honest
                    public administration with which to administer its responsibilities with respect
                    to the foreign oil companies. Things had gotten a little bit out of control
                    there (and I'm sure they had elsewhere) during the first oil price run-up, when
                    money simply rained down on these systems, and then prices had retreated, and
                    the system was in a bit of disarray. The chief Indonesian entrepreneur and head
                    of the State Oil Company had come in to disrepute for some of his handling of
                    this money, and he was being shuffled offstage and new people were being brought
                    on stage, and it was a country that was in the process of developing a liquefied
                    natural gas industry as a complement to its oil-exporting capacity. That was
                    quite exciting, but what really took it off again was the second oil price
                    run-up, and it needed that sort of a kick-start.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was what? Seventy-</hi>

                <p>TAYLOR: '79.</p>
                <p>Q: As you were looking at this, what were you looking at, really, as the
                    petroleum officer?</p>
                <p>TAYLOR: Well, first, several things. It's hard to believe today, but at that time
                    the American embassy was the world's finest source of accurate and timely
                    information on the Indonesian petroleum industry. It was even more accurate than
                    the Indonesian sources, and so everyone who cared, whether they were in
                    Washington or in London or in Jakarta, about the condition of the Indonesian
                    petroleum industry relied upon the American embassy's petroleum officer, whose
                    networks of contacts and information was better and larger than just about
                    anyone else's. So there was almost an interesting global infrastructure of
                    people and organizations who, for some reason, cared about the Indonesian
                    petroleum industry that that petroleum officer position networked with and was
                    in constant touch with. And kind of the epitome of that was an annual petroleum
                    report drafted by that officer, which was just an incredible international
                    bestseller.</p>
                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>That report kind of summarized, in an unclassified way, what we knew at the
                    embassy about the condition of the Indonesian petroleum sector. I know that in
                    the month that it was due, which was always April, I would receive calls at the
                    end of March until it was actually out, whatever date it happened to come out,
                    from all over the world - just scores of calls - saying, “Is it out?” and “We
                    need it immediately.” There were from universities, from companies, from
                    governments. So that was one interesting aspect of it, that the condition of the
                    world economy and the global information system at that time was such that a
                    country like Indonesia, with a major petroleum industry, really didn't have an
                    accurate analytical or even informational base beyond what the American embassy
                    was providing.</p>
                <p>Now we used that information base and that network of contacts to promote U.S.
                    interests in a variety of ways, but particularly in promoting U.S. commercial
                    interests, to be sure that American companies got it. I'm a great believer in
                    free and fair trade, but only if I can't bias it toward American companies.
                    Indonesia was a system that was not free and fair, and so in that system I
                    played as hard as I could to be sure that American companies, American
                    businesses, American workers got the benefit of what was going on in Indonesia,
                    and got and inside track on contracts and on projects. And that ranged from
                    providing advance information - giving information to American companies first -
                    all the way through the critical decision process, in which we help the company
                    executives obtain appointments with Indonesia decision makers and sometimes,
                    when push came into shove, I would go in, or if it took more, the Ambassador
                    would go in and see the minister or even higher and really advocate as hard as
                    we could to make sure an American company got a shot at it.</p>
                <p>Q: Were you looking at what became very evident in the last year, when the
                    Indonesian meltdown came, which other Asian countries have gone through but
                    Indonesia seems to be almost the worst case of bad loans, cronyism? Were we
                    looking at the fact that Suharto's family members were all of a sudden very
                    wealthy people and that Suharto's daughter and others were getting a significant
                    share of the product. Was that a case of interest at that time?</p>
                <p>TAYLOR: I guess the answer is a little bit. From the perspective I had, there
                    were two issues that I took on directly. They didn't relate to this. The first
                    was when I arrived the conventional wisdom within Indonesia and internationally,
                    including the oil companies, was that Indonesia was about to run out of oil
                    exporting capacity, and this judgment was reached by an analysis that
                    extrapolated a then current decline in production capacity against a rapidly
                    growing domestic consumption curve that was going to cross in a few years and
                    leave this country to be a net oil importer. The World Bank subscribed to that.
                    Important parts of the U.S. government did. The IMF did. I felt this was wrong,
                    and it was one of these fallacies of extrapolation in a situation that was more
                    complicated. So I took that on analytically. The second was to try to assess and
                    analyze the growing importance of Indonesia's LNG industry as a foreign exchange
                    earner.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: LNG?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: Liquefied natural gas. And the international community that assessed
                    Indonesia's financial stature, its growth capacities, its economic prognosis, in
                    other words, had totally missed the very rapid buildup of the natural gas
                    industry and its translation of production into a liquefied natural gas export
                    capacity, which was going to be a very huge foreign exchange earner as well. So
                    that was kind of a second analytical task I took on in order to provide what I
                    thought was a more reasonable, realistic, and objective assessment of the
                    economic health of the country, which at that time, hinged substantially on its
                    hydrocarbon sector.</p>
                <p>Now after the second oil price run-up, it is true that the Economic Section where
                    I worked, including work that I did, reported fairly steadily on the way the
                    rent income generated out of that second oil price run-up was being corrupted
                    and misused and mismanaged and that that was associated with the kind of crony
                    capitalist nature of the system. But I have to say, all in all, at that time,
                    that it was a more informational middle-level issue, that that was not an issue
                    that dominated the senior agenda or senior policy-makers' attention. It was
                    something they were aware of, something they were interested in, but it didn't
                    seem critical at the time, and I guess the fact that it's all coming to a head
                    here now, 17 years later, indicates that they were right - it wasn't that
                    critical at the time.</p>
                <p>Q: Well, of course, too, it was a reflection of what had been going on in Japan
                    for years. I mean, this close relationship between banks and projects and all,
                    so this all of a sudden came to a head, really, in 1997-98.</p>
                <p>TAYLOR: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the problems in the fuel area with corruption
                        as faas American firms were concerned.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>TAYLOR: In my experience, there were some very small American entrepreneurs, one
                    or two, niched in around the edges, that were probably operating in gray areas.
                    I knew who they were in general, but they didn't come to the embassy very often.
                    They were part of the background environment that I worked in, and I would hear
                    about them second-hand or see them at a distance - and they were after a quick
                    buck. The companies that were really there, established to do business and to
                    develop the country, the big petroleum and oil service companies, were not
                    involved in corrupt practices or shady dealings, and they took very seriously
                    their legal and ethical responsibilities under U.S. law, which included the
                    Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, at that time, and including in most of these big
                    companies - the Duponts and the Shells and the Mobils and the Exxons and so
                    forth - a corporate code of ethics that governed how they operated as well. Now,
                    in order to get things done in Indonesia, they and everyone else had to use
                    middlemen, contractors, and how the contractors got the job done is... I mean,
                    we all know how they got it done. But I have to tell you, this wasn't massive
                    bribery or corruption. This was employing a middleman to get your rig out of
                    harbor, and, you know, it cost you thousands of dollars a day to have that thing
                    tied up in the harbor, and I don't know how the middleman got it out, but I bet
                    he paid $50 to a customs official. Well, I mean, that is just the grease on the
                    wheels of progress -</p>

                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: -but they had to do it through middlemen. They couldn't pay the $50, and
                    they wouldn't pay the $50, but they would hire a customs broker, who would go
                    and somehow get the rig out. But to their credit, they would establish a fair
                    basis for the service, and that's what they would pay, on an international
                    standard, on reasonable standard. They did not inflate, they did not put into
                    the remuneration to the middleman room for bribery or corruption. How the
                    middleman got it done out of a fair rate, they didn't look at, but they paid
                    what they deemed to be an international and fair rate.</p>

                <p>TAYLOR: Well, they were all there. They were all scrambling, and especially
                    around these oil price run-ups in '73 and then again in '79 and '80, because the
                    money was raining down and opportunity was golden everywhere. We had a big
                    advantage because the American embassy was staffed to support this sector and
                    had a position dedicated to doing it. Most of the other embassies relied on us
                    totally for the information base. They were some of that set of eager customers
                    for the petroleum report. They would come to my office, it seemed like every
                    day. One year I was there I counted the number of people I briefed, as the
                    embassy's petroleum officer, in a single year, and I'm counting one meeting,
                    whether there was one person there or 10 or 20. I'm not counting 20 people as 20
                    times. Single meetings. And that year I had over 400 briefings on the Indonesia
                    petroleum sector, just to give you an idea of the intensity of interest and the
                    total paucity of sources that had any expertise or knowledge on current
                    developments. And the international companies, the other international presence
                    there, the embassies, the World Bank, the IMF, were a big part of that constant
                    set of briefings. And their companies there were constantly complaining what an
                    advantage the American companies had because their embassy was staffed to
                    support them. And that was especially true of the French.</p>
                <p>Q: Well, looking it in sort of mega-economic terms, when the '79 price tidal wave
                    hit, was it the feeling that, yes, lots of money was going to Indonesia, but
                    actually we were coming out ahead on the thing because the money had to be
                    invested somewhere, and it was mainly going to the United States, or how did we
                    feel about that?</p>
                <p>TAYLOR: Well, it was certainly a boon for the American petroleum industry, in a
                    way, but I don't think any of us thought that oil price spikes like that were
                    good for the kind of international economy we wanted to see in place. It was so
                    disruptive and so distorting. But fortunately the second price run-up was so
                    severe that it did set in motions counterbalancing and self-correcting forces,
                    and as you know, today on an inflation-adjusted basis, gasoline has never been
                    cheaper. So that was kind of the last hurrah of those who thought we were
                    running out of oil and that prices would continuously trend up in real
                    terms.</p>

                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: Well, nowhere near the big Gulf producers, but quite a nice, sizable
                    secondary-level producer. They exported more than Algeria and those kinds of
                    countries. And very important player in the Pacific basin and particularly with
                    respect to Japan and to the West Coast of the United States as well.</p>
                <p>Q: What about the Japanese? Were they trying to corral Indonesia sort of into
                    their market? I mean, they tried to do it once. I mean, World War II, as far as
                    we're concerned, a major cause was Japan wanting to grab Indonesian oil. And I
                    was wondering what was happening now some 30 years later.</p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>TAYLOR: Well, Japanese businessmen were quite aggressive in Indonesia at the
                    time, and I'm sure they continue to be. American companies dominated the
                    petroleum sector, though. Japanese companies were there in small amounts, but
                    they weren't then and aren't now competitive, in terms of their services or
                    their capabilities with the international oil industry, which is dominated by,
                    you know, a set of American companies.</p>
                <p>Q: What about the impact of the oil companies. I'm not talking about the money
                    impact that hit the higher branches of government, but out in the field, because
                    you put a crew into a place, and oil people, the roustabouts, the oil crews are
                    not the most sophisticated group of people. It's rough, dangerous, hard work.
                    Was this a problem?</p>
                <p>TAYLOR: Not generally. There were one or two cases. There was an important
                    problem where the leadership of the local international company broke down, and
                    itself lost control, lost control of itself and created some local problems. By
                    and large, though, many of the newly discovered Indonesian fields, the ones that
                    were discovered in the '60s and '70s, were in kind of isolated areas, and the
                    traditional practice of the international oil companies was to bring in those
                    workers on rigs offshore or onshore, work them straight for 30 days and then
                    give them 30 days off with a ticket anywhere they wanted in the world, and they
                    just showed up again a month later. So they really didn't have the discretionary
                    free time to relate to the local community. They worked full-time when they were
                    there, and when they weren't working, they weren't there. And it just went 30
                    days on and 30 days off.</p>
                <p>Now there was a very sizable, longstanding production capacity in Sumatra, a
                    Caltex production, where over decades there had been built up a foreign presence
                    living cheek by jowl with an Indonesian presence. That was extremely well
                    managed, I think, by international standards. Obviously, there are cultural and
                    other challenges always in a situation like that. That can't be eliminated, but
                    in terms of managing them in a decent and sensitive way, I think the company had
                    come to do that and had finally gotten to the point where it was even able to
                    make an Indonesian the head of the local company, as opposed to constantly
                    bringing in an expatriate to do that. I think that was an important watershed in
                    that particular company's evolution.</p>

                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>TAYLOR: Yes, there were a few. They were mainly offshore. Push never came to
                    shove while I was there. I used to write reports about those areas and what the
                    Indonesians thought of them, what the American companies thought of them as
                    prospective production or exploration sites, and to try to sort of give a heads
                    up if the Indonesians or the American industry were trying to push for action or
                    decisions in any of those areas. It turned out that that was mainly
                    informational, and there was never any conflict while I was here in any of those
                    regions.</p>

                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: Well, they were okay by the time I got there. Some of those earlier,
                    really difficult and even bloody sets of relationships had been overcome, and a
                    sort of stability had set in over the borders, and the relationship. So there
                    was that legacy still to deal with. It was still in people's minds and recent.
                    But it was at that time accepted as being history and not part of the

                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: Yes, especially given the experiences in 1965 and the clear understanding
                    of the importance and the uniqueness of the Chinese community in Indonesia, that
                    was something the embassy always had its eye on and was sensitive to.</p>

                <p>TAYLOR: I don't know that there were crises; there were just huge sets of
                    exciting opportunities associated with developments in the petroleum sector,
                    opportunities for American companies, major projects, and it was a window, I
                    have to say - a very good window for us - into the decision and thinking
                    processes of OPEC, which today doesn't seem to be too important, but in those
                    days people thought it was critical. And we did an awful lot of reporting using
                    that window on decisions being made elsewhere or thoughts about decisions that
                    were being considered elsewhere in the oil-exporting world but based on
                    information that we had got in Jakarta.</p>

                <p>TAYLOR: A lot of major project opportunities - refineries, petrochemical

                <p>TAYLOR: No, we did it. FCS wasn't in existence then, and we did the commercial
                    work at the time. And, again, on the petroleum side of the house, it was a very
                    high priority because the projects were so big, the money was so big, and the
                    scale of U.S. interests - the Bechtels, the Fluors, all of the big engineering
                    companies and capital equipment, shipbuilding, you know, General Dynamics - they
                    all wanted a piece of that action, so it was a big part of our work.</p>

                <p>TAYLOR: Yes, these were world-class companies going after world-class projects,
                    and the big players knew they had to give good value and good service. What they
                    were interested in was making sure they got a fair shake in an environment where

                    that, you know, what you were doing would attract 400 interviews in a year.</p>
                <p>TAYLOR: I'm sure some of my colleagues thought I fitted in a bit awkwardly, but
                    what I can tell you is that the leadership of the section really understood the
                    importance of it. More importantly, the leadership of the embassy did, and I
                    think the Ambassador and the DCM both gave me a lot of running room and expected
                    me to take advantage of it because my contacts were their contacts, both on the
                    Indonesian side - I dealt directly with the minister, the head of the state oil
                    company, all of the decision makers (so did the DCM and the Ambassador, usually
                    in a different way), and I knew personally and very well - just
                    see-you-every-week, come-to-my-home-I-go-to-your-home basis - the head of every
                    American petroleum company in the country, and those were the ambassador's and
                    the DCM's contacts as well, and I think they wanted to be sure that the embassy
                    was being effective with that set of influential and important contacts.</p>

                <p>Q: What about over the years by this time the educational infrastructure of
                    Indonesia - that's the wrong term, but in other words, where were people in the
                    ministries and all getting their expertise, and where were they being
                    trained?</p>
                <p>TAYLOR: All over the world. All over the world. A large number of them, in the
                    United States, some in Germany or Holland, some in Japan (relatively few), but
                    they had a good international exposure, and the set of officials, the key
                    officials there, were capable global actors. The problem is that they weren't
                    deep, and you'd have one or two people that could think and act on a kind of a
                    global level, but there was no follow-through. They weren't deep enough to have
                    organizations and professional systems that could follow through at that level
                    of decision making or leadership, and so things tended to go bad fairly quickly.
                    Even though it sounded as though the meeting or the decision had gone your way,
                    a month or two later it seemed to be chaos, and you couldn't quite understand
                    how we had gotten from what we thought was a clear and important kind of
                    decision to a place where we couldn't see any relationship to what we had
                    understood.</p>

                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: You know, I didn't see it much from my vantage in the embassy. I
                    certainly knew about the human rights emphasis of the Carter Administration. It
                    was quite controversial and important within the State Department itself, and I
                    remember reading cables from other posts about the visit of Pat Darien and other
                    important people in that initiative, but I don't remember anything that dramatic
                    happening in Indonesia, although it well could have because you had the East
                    Timor issue, you had an issue of prisoners being held in conditions and for a
                    long time stemming from the 1960s and not clear what the basis of that might be.
                    So there was a whole host - and you had a system that, however benevolent it
                    might have been at the time and however much we found ways to cooperate with it,
                    was clearly not democratic in our sense of the word. So there are all sorts of
                    potential entry points for this human rights emphasis, and maybe the Ambassador
                    or the political counselor of the time would remember episodes about that that I
                    don't, but it didn't touch me in many ways.</p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>We did get into an incipient environmental issue, which I thought was really
                    important, and that was about the impact of developing these massive liquefied
                    natural gas facilities up at the tip of Sumatra, in a place called Aceh. And I
                    remember thinking at the time that I wasn't necessarily too pleased with myself
                    for pushing the American company position as strongly as I did. I kept thinking,
                    But you know, there are environmental consequences to this that I don't
                    understand, but the environmental groups couldn't send people to my office or to
                    the embassy. They were back in the U.S. If they knew about it at all it was a
                    marginal issue to them, and of course, the companies could send - and did send -
                    scores of very powerful lawyers and engineers and executives to explain why
                    their position was the right one. And I was thinking, We've really got an
                    asymmetry here between our understanding of the company's position and our
                    understanding of environmental issues. But at that time, kind of international
                    environmental projects and consequences were not yet a big part of American
                    foreign policy. You know, if that same issue had materialized last year,
                    probably Tim Wirth would have been standing in the embassy having something to
                    say about it.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: I found it a real education, because I had never been to Canada and, like
                    most Americans, knew it was up there and knew it was nice and didn't really know
                    what that meant in any specific terms. And I got up there and found quite a
                    fascinating country, full of interesting little issues that I didn't hear
                    anything about when I was in the United States, and I was lucky enough to get
                    there at exactly the time that the Canadian government made a decision to bet
                    its entire economic future on inevitable price rises in oil. And it busted
                    itself. I mean, it imploded as a result. It made a huge mistake, but the
                    consequences of the mistake didn't come home for three or four years, until they
                    realized what a huge mistake. So I bumped right in, in a very fortuitous timing,
                    to being at the center of U.S.-Canadian relations in this kind of energy niche
                    that I was in, and as a consequence, really had a fascinating assignment in
                    Ottawa, got to travel everywhere in Canada, and was on the cutting edge of the
                    issue that dominated U.S.-Canadian relations for about two and one-half
                    years.</p>

                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: -to '84. Q: I assume you had several ambassadors at that time.</p>
                <p>TAYLOR: I had two. I got there in the summer of 1980, and President Carter would
                    lose the election in November, and so we would get a new ambassador, but
                    President Reagan's ambassador who came was there throughout my entire
                    period.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: That was Paul Robinson. Ken Curtis was there when I arrived. He was a
                    very nice man, but he left, really, the day of the election - didn't even wait
                    until January 20th, I think - and he had been the former governor of Maine. He
                    was a great fellow, but I only worked under his leadership for a couple of
                    months.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As you were still, what, the fuels officer?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: In Ottawa it was called the energy officer because there was, in addition
                    to oil and gas, other important energy relationships with the United States, not
                    the least of which was a massive electricity trade out of Quebec.</p>
                <p>Q: Was there a difference in emphasis, set-up, or anything between being the
                    energy officer in Ottawa and being the fuels officer in Indonesia, in the
                    pecking order or emphasis?</p>
                <pb facs="0060" n="Page0060"/>
                <p>TAYLOR: No. In Indonesia, it was just by self-definition a very important job. I
                    had succeeded two great officers in that job who had really established it as in
                    its own unique niche - James Matts, who had it in the early '70s and went on to
                    work for Fluor after he left the job, and then Mark Johnson (and I succeeded
                    Mark). They had defined the job and shaped its role. Because Indonesia was such
                    a well-known petroleum country and petroleum exporter, the importance of that
                    job went with the territory. Now that was not true in Canada, and under ordinary
                    circumstances, I think in the pecking order the job I got in Canada might not
                    have been too visible or even too exciting. It would have been a run-of-the-mill
                    thing, but as I mentioned earlier, by dint of fortuitous timing, I arrived there
                    just a few months before the Canadian government launched this massive, bold
                    initiative called the National Energy Program, which bet the country's economic
                    future on large, inevitable price rises in oil, and sought to use what I call a
                    set of measures that approximated creeping expropriation to, in essence,
                    nationalize the private sector, which was heavily American. That is, betting
                    your future on price rises would have been Canada's own mistake, and we would
                    have left them to stew in it, but adopting a set of measures that look like
                    creeping expropriation along our northern border went right to the top in the
                    U.S. government, and so I found myself in a portfolio that had immediate immense
                    interest at the top levels of the U.S. government, surprising - they were
                    shocked by what Canada was doing.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was this reflected in what you were doing, this

                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: And that's my term. I mean, the Canadians would not like it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As you went around when this first came out, was this
                        evident ithe legislation?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>TAYLOR: Oh, absolutely, totally clear. It first came out as part of the federal
                    budget, which is a big exercise in Canada, in any parliamentary system, the
                    announcement of the budget, and the embassy stays up all night. The budget is
                    given in the evening, and the embassy stays up all night and analyzes it. That's
                    a tradition. But usually it's the Treasury part of the embassy, the financial
                    part of the embassy. This time we knew that the energy legislation would
                    dominate it - we'd already discovered that - so I was there to stay up all night
                    as well. I know the very first cable that we sent said that this massive, bold
                    initiative had two central themes. The first was to federalize the energy sector
                    and the revenue flows from the energy sector within Canada, and the second was
                    to nationalize the petroleum industry, which meant that the U.S. private
                    companies were going to come under great pressure either to sell or to take on
                    Canadian partners.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was still the Carter Administration when this came out,
                        was it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: Just barely, that's right. It came out in October.President Carter would
                    lose the election a month later.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the reaction in Washington and elsewhere in the
                        States?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: You could tell it was a lame-duck administration. We had done enough work
                    to see that something big was coming that was going to affect American
                    interests, and we had sent a cable actually saying this is worth somebody
                    senior, like maybe a Secretary of the Treasury, maybe an under secretary of
                    State, calling the Canadian finance minister and the Canadian energy minister
                    and expressing concern, based on embassy reporting. Nobody was interested, and I
                    think the reason nobody was interested - maybe we weren't convincing enough that
                    something big was coming - but I expect the political environment here just
                    wasn't willing to take on what seemed to be such a marginal task at that
                    moment.</p>
                <p>Now once it hit, lights went on all over Washington, not necessarily because of
                    the embassy reporting, although that should have been sufficient, but because
                    they were getting immediate from the American industry saying you've got to do
                    something about this.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you catching this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: Oh, yes. They loved it. That portion of the Canadian public opinion that
                    thinks in the way you describe just thought this was wonderful. But Canadian
                    public opinion is not homogenous. It is diverse, although you may not realize it
                    down here because you never hear about it, and this program was very popular in
                    central Canada, which was energy consuming and has that foreign policy attitude,
                    anyhow. In the energy-producing sections of Canada, out west, particularly in
                    Alberta, this was almost a declaration of war, against them more than it was
                    against the United States. As I said, the first theme here was to federalize the
                    Canadian energy sector. Canada has a very decentralized system. The provinces
                    have a great deal of power and authority, and Alberta opposed the National
                    Energy Program, for its own reasons and its own set of interests, as fervently
                    and as effectively as did we. So there was support, and within the Canadian
                    system, that we tried to work with and mobilize to achieve our interests in
                    opposing some features, the features that we felt violated Canada's
                    international obligations in the OECD and elsewhere and those features which we
                    felt were a direct attack on international comity and contractual relationships
                    and the status of American industry already operating within Canada.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I take it Pierre Trudeau was not a favorite of our
                        embassy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: It depends on what you mean by a favorite. I think most of us thought he
                    was absolutely masterful at what he did. The problem was we didn't always like
                    what he did in terms of U.S. interests. So I think there was a mixture of great
                    respect and admiration for him as a Canadian leader, and a recognition that U.S.
                    interests were going to be under some pressure from the kinds of policies that
                    he believed in during the early 1980s, particularly regarding the oil sector,
                    and more generally U.S. investment.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What cards did we have to play if the Canadians wanted to
                        movahead with this creeping nationalization?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                <p>TAYLOR: That's exactly what senior officials in Washington soon came to ask.
                    Where's our leverage? What can we do to them? And I'll tell you, at the end of
                    the day there are a whole set of things that we went through. We tried to sort
                    of identify specific programs, activities, and relationships that could be used
                    as leverage, and in the end we rejected that, and I think rightly so, because
                    there's a much bigger leverage that we did play and eventually played extremely
                    effectively. And that is that this is a relationship of importance to both
                    countries, and while as you pointed out a very substantial portion - a majority
                    of the Canadian public - likes occasionally to stick it to the big guy down
                    south, the Canadian public knows and understands and will not tolerate a
                    government that picks a continuous fight with the United States. Canada can only
                    lose from a souring of the relationship across the board and from the top, in
                    which the President of the United States, senior Cabinet officers are giving
                    speeches about Canada's unfairness, about Canada's violation of international
                    practices and obligations and of questioning whether we can trust Canada in our
                    commercial, our economic, and our political relationships. It was that constant
                    drumbeat of sort of saying, Canada, you've really gotten off the reservation
                    this time, and we may not be picking this or that issue to hit you with, but
                    we're not going to let you be this far off the reservation without speaking out
                    about it, without pointing it out, and without holding you under the spotlight
                    of critical analysis. And eventually, along with the fact that they made a huge
                    mistake (oil prices went down, not up), that proved effective in reversing that
                    set of proposals.</p>
                <p>Q: I suppose it was also helpful to have the Reagan Administration in, because he
                    was considered not to be an internationalist and a rather tough person as far as
                    if you started messing around and certainly was not in favor of nationalization
                    or federalization of our property.</p>
                <p>TAYLOR: Yes, I think the Reagan Administration did take a tough attitude about
                    this. I suspect any American administration would have, but maybe not to the
                    same degree with the same intensity as the Reagan Administration did. I think
                    that's right. The Canadians caught a little bit of bad timing from their point
                    of view in that respect, too, because they got no sympathetic ears in Washington
                    with the Reagan Administration. There was no part of Washington that was saying,
                    oh, well, we have to understand their point of view. We did understand their
                    point of view, and we damn well didn't like it, and that was all of us. So they
                    caught a bit of bad timing on that.</p>

                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: Well, almost immediately, but I think that it became persuasive that the
                    trend was down only after a couple of years, and at that point Canada's National
                    Energy Program simply wasn't working - never mind whether you liked its
                    philosophy, never mind whether you believed it was right-minded or right in some
                    political or international sense - the plain fact of the matter is that it
                    didn't fly, so something had to be done about it.</p>

                <p>TAYLOR: It was interesting, is what I would say. I acquired, eventually, a great

                    an issue of such importance we had to go above the bureaucratic level. They
                    simply couldn't meet our concerns, and we fought this out at a much higher
                    level, and in fact, at some points, probably were pretty close to the line of
                    what they considered overreaching for an embassy. We did work closely with those
                    sections of Canadian public opinion, including provincial governments, that were
                    opposed to Canada's policy, and we did have a big network of non-governmental
                    contacts that we used to try to mobilize opinion and to try to make sure that
                    our position was well understood in Canada. And so this was an issue in which we
                    didn't just present d�marches to the Foreign Ministry and wait for their answer,
                    which was always unsatisfactory.</p>
                <p>Q: You know, one of the things that all of us observe in foreign embassies that
                    come here is often they don't really understand how America works. And they come
                    and they go to the Department of State, when actually you should be out in the
                    halls of Congress and appearing on a television show and hitting the media. How
                    about Canada? Was there a different way for an embassy to work there.</p>
                <p>TAYLOR: There was, and we did, and that's what I was saying, that we didn't just
                    work through the federal government on this issue. I'll tell you, though, the
                    point you're making is very interesting, because one of the biggest effects of
                    this National Energy Program effort and its blowup, internationally and
                    domestically, was that Canada changed the way it dealt with the United States.
                    The Foreign Ministry was out of the loop in the development of this plan in the
                    first place. They were as surprised as we were. They knew that- (end of
                    tape)They learned that they had to, as a foreign ministry, get on top of the
                    development of issues like this before the fact and not after the fact, and they
                    went through a reorganization internally, a redefinition of the foreign
                    ministry's role within the government in the development of such policies, and
                    they staffed and managed their embassy differently here in Washington as a
                    result. And so the ripple effects of this National Energy Program, its boldness
                    and its sensitivities and controversies and its failures, extended into the
                    Canadian system as much as they did into the U.S.-Canadian relationship.</p>

                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: Yes. When you say “you,” I did, but also very much our consul general in
                    Calgary, where the companies were mainly located, was heavily involved in this,
                    too. I must have spent half of my time in Canada in Calgary as a result of this
                    program, and the consul general spent probably all of his time.</p>

                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: Rich Wilson. He was terrific. He did a terrific job. Ifact, you ought to
                    interview him if you haven't.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where is he now?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: I don't know where he is now. Rich Wilson. In fact, after that he went to
                    Jakarta, so it would be a good interview about Indonesia, too.</p>
                <p>Q: Were there any issues concerning U.S. oil up in Alaska? Did that have any
                    effect, or was that just a different matter?</p>
                <p>TAYLOR: There was a lingering issue because there had been an agreement to build
                    a natural gas pipeline from Alaska into the United States that went across
                    Canada, and there was a whole organization and budget in Canada dedicated to
                    shepherding that along, even though by the time I arrived that project was
                    dubious because of the economic changes. Managing the fate of the Alaska Natural
                    Gas Transportation System (ANGTS), was one of the jobs that the embassy had and
                    that I was the point person for from the embassy. That turned out to be very
                    useful, though not on a project basis, because it eventually had to fade away
                    like such projects must, but because there were such senior Canadian officials
                    involved in that project that my relationship with them, which began and was
                    nurtured through my role in that project, became important on the wider energy
                    relationship, on the National Energy Program and these more controversial,
                    dynamic issues. And I had an access and an ear and a network that I wouldn't
                    have had without having been able to use that project to get into it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, we talk about energy. Did you cover the electric
                        grid, too?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: Insofar as there was an international dimension to it we did. And there
                    was some all across the border, actually, but the issues we dealt with always
                    seemed to be associated with Quebec and Hydro-Quebec and the Quebec factor in
                    Canadian domestic politics. Other than that, the cross-border electricity
                    exchanges really worked extremely well, and they worked with Quebec, too. It's
                    just always their sensitivities in the U.S. capital markets or the U.S. energy
                    market about whether Quebec is going to be in Canada or not and what that means
                    to them. So it was really more of a political interest, even though the energy
                    sector seemed to be the occasion of it.</p>
                <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                <p>Q: Well, while you were in that embassy, sort of the great unspoken thing, I
                    think, for some time, and obviously is today still, is what if Quebec moves out?
                    I mean, this is a very important factor in how our relations will go, but if we
                    even talk about it or plan about it and the Canadians hear about it, then we'll
                    go up in smoke, you know, and everything we do, I mean, whispered consultations
                    on “What if?”</p>
                <p>TAYLOR: In the period 1980-84, there were not. Now I'll just jump ahead and
                    remind you that I went back to Canada as economic minister from '89 to '92. That
                    was a period of the abortive Meech Lake Accord, and during that period, there
                    was quite a bit of discussion on this issue, very senior-level discussion, and
                    in fact, as you might remember, President Bush went further than any American
                    president has in departing from the traditional mantra that this was up to
                    Canadians. So that issue became much more electric and actionable in the '89-92
                    period.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which we'll cover when we get to this.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about, since it has something to do with energy and
                        all, diyou get involved in the acid rain business at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: A little bit. Now Canada was one of these countries in which we had a
                    science attach�, and the science attach� covered the environmental issues. And
                    the acid rain issue was very interesting. I can remember President Reagan made
                    his first international trip to Canada after he was elected, and it was a
                    subject of some controversy. Even Canadian cabinet officers, one at least,
                    demonstrated against his visit, carrying a sign saying “Stop Acid Rain.” I
                    remember very well that the vast army of people that accompany a presidential
                    visit had never heard of acid rain, and so most of the U.S. staffers were
                    running around with buttons that said “Stop Acid Rain” because it sounded like
                    something you should stop, and they'd never heard of it before. So it was a very
                    interesting moment.</p>
                <p>Q: But that didn't really intrude on your-TAYLOR: At that time, it was not an
                    issue that I managed. Somebody else did. Now, again, in the '89-92 period, acid
                    rain had not disappeared, and we had incorporated the science attach� in to the
                    Economic Section, and so when I became the economic minister-counselor in the
                    later period, kind of managing the acid rain issue was something that was more
                    directly in my portfolio later.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, dealing with this very sensitive issue, how about
                        thpolitics of Canada during this '80-84 period? Were there any
                        elections?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0067" n="Page0067"/>
                <p>TAYLOR: Sure.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And how did we view - I mean, were we sort of looking at,
                        Gee, hope one side will win over the other - you know, from your
                        perspective?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: You know, the watershed here was the departure of Pierre Trudeau from the
                    political scene. He had made his decision to retire in, I think it was, '84. And
                    that was a real watershed in the relationship. I think clearly the Reagan
                    government had a preference for the Conservative Party. That manifested itself
                    clearly, and later in '89-92, when we were so close to the Mulroney government.
                    But I think the Democratic Party in the United States probably would have a more
                    philosophical preference for the Liberal Party in Canada, so we made no effort,
                    ever, to interfere in Canadian domestic politics. I think different governments
                    in the United States did have different philosophic preferences, but the basic
                    commitment is to get on together as good neighbors. We've got so much in common,
                    we've got so much to do together, and I think that transcends, really, any of
                    these philosophical preferences.</p>
                <p>Q: What was life like, living in Canada, working with your Canadian colleagues. I
                    mean, did you have to go through sort of this “poor little us” and “you're such
                    a big” and “it's like sleeping with an elephant” and - TAYLOR: Oh, yes, you hear
                    that all the time. Those are the mantras. They're all over the place, but you
                    don't pay any attention to those. Let me tell you what life was like. Life in
                    Canada, in the early 1980s, was like life in the United States in the early
                    1950s. It was calm, decent, civilized, and it was the nicest family community
                    from that middle-class American vantage point of and earlier period that we have
                    ever lived in. Your kids could travel all over safely on buses and walk the
                    streets at night, and if there were problems in the schools it was because
                    somebody was throwing a spitball, you know, and things like that. So it was a
                    wonderful middle-class family sort of environment at that time. The Canadians do
                    have that. You sort of just have deal with it, but you don't take it too
                    seriously, is the way you move forward. We enjoyed living in Canada very much,
                    and we learned a lot. Again, I think it's an interesting country. It's full of
                    people that have kind of a different perspective on North American culture and
                    North American life. You don't get that perspective south of the border too
                    often. We found it fascinating, even when we didn't agree with it, and we still
                    have so many good personal friends who are Canadians who were made - established
                    friendships with them - in that earlier period, and then they were reinforced
                    when we went back in '89-92. We kind of think of Canada, from a personal point
                    of view, from a family point of view, as a second home.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about Ambassador Robinson? He was, I gather, a
                        businessman,a bit of a rough cob, wasn't he, or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: Yes, I think that would be a fair assessment of him.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0068" n="Page0068"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But how did he operate and how effective was he?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: Well, he operated kind of on his own level and in his own way, which was
                    to sort of speak his mind quickly about things. He, I think, had a rough go, at
                    least initially in central Canada, where there is all these sensitivities about
                    elephants and mouse and stuff. They loved him in western Canada. In fact, when
                    this National Energy Program came along and divided Canada as much as it divided
                    the U.S. and the Canadian governments, Ambassador Robinson didn't get friendly
                    receptions in central Canada, but he got standing ovations all the time in
                    western Canada. In fact, I remember a big audience in Calgary once, and
                    Ambassador Robinson was lambasting the National Energy Program, as only he could
                    do - he certainly wasn't using any of the talking points that I had given him,
                    but there he was - and when he was done he got this stormy applause, and this
                    one leading Calgary citizen stood up and said, “Ambassador, I don't know what
                    you said, but keep on saying it.” It was just kind of the perfect expression of
                    Ambassador Robinson's diplomacy.</p>

                <p>TAYLOR: No, because whatever else we need to cover we can get i'89-92. We're
                    going to come back to Canada.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0069" n="Page0069"/>
                <p>TAYLOR: Well, there were some interesting... Again, this was a time when Canada
                    had bet its future on rising prices, and Canada wasn't the only organization or
                    country that had. There were going to be companies that go broke that had
                    thought they could bet on rising prices, and so a lot of things came out of
                    that. They have these huge oil sands projects in northern Alberta which are
                    almost like science fiction in terms of size of the machineries involved and so
                    forth, and those were at the time thought by some to be the wave of the future,
                    even though it cost 40 or 50 bucks a barrel to extract oil from these tar sands,
                    that people thought that with oil prices trending up they would be something of
                    a major future production source. Visiting up there was really an eye-opener for
                    me, and there there is an interesting impact, because I got my first
                    introduction later reinforced elsewhere in Canada, in Quebec, at the impact of
                    these sorts of operations on, I guess we're going to have to call them, Native
                    Canadians. They're Indian tribes that live in Canada. And they were really in
                    quite desperate situation and not profiting very much by all of these
                    high-powered activities going on all around them.</p>
                <p>The other thing was that there were interesting projects in the works. Some of
                    them never materialized, like bringing LNG into Canada all the way from
                    Indonesia. It was Dome Petroleum that was going to do it, and I remember sitting
                    in their office in Calgary with the president of the company, and I said, “I
                    just don't understand this. You're sending gas from British Columbia down south,
                    and you're talking about bringing gas into Canada from Indonesia. There's just
                    got to be some disconnect here. I just can't follow the logic. Of course, the
                    question is what makes sense for a company may not make sense for a country, and
                    if you can get the economics right, you can do a lot of things like that. And
                    then you had Mobil Oil developing what was thought to be a massive - it turned
                    out to be less so, but nonetheless interesting - oil opportunity off the coast
                    of Newfoundland, the Hibernia Oil Field, which was a project of interest then
                    and, of course, then, later turned into this terrible disaster when that rig
                    tipped over and hundreds of Newfoundlanders were lost at sea.</p>
                <p>And this was a period in which Canadian gas exports to the United States actually
                    went up, and the embassy played a big role in that, working with some
                    entrepreneurial companies in the United States that really thought they saw a
                    creative niche, to bring Canadian gas into central and eastern United States,
                    and it gets all the way in to Boston and New York now, and that was quite a
                    vision and quite a piece of work to put all of that together. So we were
                    involved in a lot.</p>
                <p>Q: Well, on these things, did you find, was there any element that was trying to
                    stop cooperation between the United States and Canada within the Canadian body
                    politic? I mean, extreme nationalists or anything like that?</p>
                <pb facs="0070" n="Page0070"/>
                <p>TAYLOR: Well, the people that wrote the National Energy Program would not have
                    put their intentions in the way you just did, but the consequences of the
                    policies that they advocated and then passed into legislation were such that
                    energy cooperation between the United States and Canada was put in great
                    jeopardy for a while. There were a number of features of the Canadian
                    legislation, particularly a retroactive feature, in which the Canadian
                    government acquired retroactively a 25 percent interest in existing projects and
                    discoveries (that is what led to my characterization of the package of measures
                    - that plus three or four others - as creeping expropriation) that put a chill,
                    not just on government relations and the way we thought of each other and talked
                    to each other, but on private sector investment decisions. If a government like
                    Canada's was going to come in and pass retroactive confiscatory sorts of pieces
                    of legislation, how could you trust it? I mean, could you trust that it wouldn't
                    be 50 percent five years from now or a hundred percent some day. So the
                    consequences of what they did initially with the National Energy Program did put
                    a chill on new initiatives in the region.</p>
                <p>Q: Did you at some point after this act came out do an analysis of who were the
                    sort of apparatchiks who drew it up? It sounds to me like this would be coming
                    out of the more virulent anti-American academic world.</p>
                <p>TAYLOR: Well, Stu, you must know something about this, because you've sort of hit
                    the nail on the head. There was one person in particular who was really the
                    chief architect of this, and he had three or four others. It was only that small
                    group, centered in the Department oEnergy and in the Department of Finance, who,
                    speaking directly with the Prime Minister, put this together and surprised most
                    of the rest of the government, including the Foreign Ministry, with such a bold
                    initiative there in October of 1980. You're absolutely right, there was a small
                    coterie of people whose brilliance brought forth this. And I remember telling
                    the man who was the chief architect -</p>

                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: Well, Ed Clark was his name. I remember telling him that if he'd written
                    this as a book, I believe it should win a prize, but to put it full blown into
                    practice is a disaster. It's just a horrible disaster. It's one thing to have
                    these theoretical concepts and this kind of nationalistic proposals. It all
                    sounds wonderful as long as you don't do it, as long as you're just talking
                    about it. But doing it was monstrous. And there we were.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find it? What did you get out of it, and what
                        do yothink the War College got out of you?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0072" n="Page0072"/>
                <p>TAYLOR: Well, I got a lot out of it. It was a great year. I think I only wish
                    that more State Department officers could have that experience. Let me start on
                    a light note. I learned a lot about military culture. You know, they go a lot by
                    protocol and rank and things, so I guess, somehow, I was first among equals in
                    rank, probably by date of promotion, I suppose, things that we don't even know
                    about in the Foreign Service, but mean so much to the military. In my little
                    homeroom of people - you know, there are 160 people in each class; we had it
                    divided down into 20-person homerooms so you can get some socialization and
                    personal networking and relationships established - so here I am and I'm deemed
                    the leader of this 20-person room. And so I say, well, what does that mean? And
                    that means, oh, well, then each of these homerooms has to have an athletic
                    committee, a social committee, a yearbook committee, and I remember thinking to
                    myself, Stu, My God, I'm going to have to do all these things myself. I don't
                    want to do any of them. And so I called the homeroom together, and my heart was
                    just in my stomach, and I said, you now, “I've just been told that each homeroom
                    has to have all of these committees,” and sure enough, you know - there were
                    about four or five State Department people in the homeroom, and there were 15 or
                    16 military people - and sure enough, the minute I said we were going to have to
                    have these committees and we needed a chairman for each committee and stuff, the
                    State Department people broke eye-contact with me. I was going to have to do it
                    all. But much to my surprise, without any further prompting, the military people
                    immediately raised their hands and said I'll to do the yearbook, I'll to the
                    athletic, I'll do the social, and on and on. They just knew it went with the
                    territory: you had to volunteer. That was a great eye-opener. I was so happy at
                    the end of that. Thank god for that culture of volunteering, because all those
                    State Department people just started looking at the ceiling and the floor the
                    minute I said I needed some volunteers. They weren't going to be one of
                    them.</p>
                <p>Q: I would have though that your real knowledge of fuels - because fuels were and
                    continue to be a very important thing - were you able to sort of bring this
                    expertise to the table at the War College?</p>
                <pb facs="0073" n="Page0073"/>
                <p>TAYLOR: A little bit, because it was still a big issue in the curriculum there,
                    and there was a strategy and a Middle East component to it and it was part of
                    almost all war gaming and crisis scenarios - further oil price run-ups or
                    cutoffs or a Qadhafi-type seizing the government of Saudi Arabia and plunging
                    the world oil market into chaos - these were all part of the military thinking
                    about crisis scenarios, so I fit naturally into all of those things, but really,
                    I thought the War College was very effective at trying to develop more strategic
                    thinking on the part of the people that went there. Now some people resisted
                    this. Maybe they didn't like it. I loved it. I thought that was the right
                    step-up for all of us at that point in our career, that we should be moving
                    beyond what we had been doing and starting to put ourselves in the kinds of
                    positions that we hoped and expected to be in in three or four years. That was
                    the real value of this training. It was not preparation for the next job. It was
                    kind of a step-up in the scope of your vision and your ability to comprehend how
                    different levels of leadership have to attack issues and interests and
                    challenges. And I thought the curriculum and the leadership at the War College
                    did a fine job of setting that out and giving us the opportunity to do it. And I
                    really enjoyed meeting so many diverse people who brought so many different
                    perspectives to bear on problems. I mean, the Marine Corps sees an issue
                    differently than the Air Force, differently than the State Department, and yet
                    in a certain sense, we get to the point in our National Security System where
                    all of those viewpoints have to be brought to the table and reconciled into some
                    sensible bottom line for action. And that was a valuable lesson out of the War
                    College.</p>
                <p>Q: I'm not sure exactly on the timing, but '84 to '85 we were in the High Reagan
                    Period, but things are changing in the Soviet Union. Were you getting or was
                    your class getting a feel about changes in the world as far as the Soviets were
                    concerned, or was this pretty-TAYLOR: No, I think it was standard stuff, and
                    you're right, it was High Reagan Period. The military was riding high again. It
                    had recovered from its despair of the late Carter years, and it had been infused
                    now with enough new resources that it was now back on, it was very confident,
                    but still seeing the world, I think, through the same sort of prism that had
                    dominated U.S. strategic thinking throughout the Cold War period. The War
                    College experience did not in any way - it made an effort and succeeded in
                    bringing in a range of controversial speakers on every subject - I did not try
                    to just push a kind of conventional wisdom line at the students. I made a
                    deliberate effort on every issue to find a full range of speakers and bring them
                    in and let people decide. But I do not remember any speaker, and we had some
                    really interesting ones, who in any way prepared the student body for the
                    breakup of the Soviet Union within -</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Or even closer relationships before the breakup with
                        Gorbacheand all that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: There was a little bit of that sort of thing, that one could imagine a
                    relationship evolving that was closer and less confrontational, less risky.
                    There was some of that. But the notion that during the professional lifetime of
                    the people that were sitting in the class, we would be foreign policy-national
                    security managers and leaders in a world that no longer had the Soviet Union was
                    nowhere on the table.</p>
                <pb facs="0074" n="Page0074"/>
                <p>Q: It certainly wasn't on the table in the Soviet Union staff college, and nobody
                    would say it this way. I mean this makes one think about the prognostications of
                    anything. The academic world certainly wasn't playing with it.</p>
                <p>TAYLOR: You remember Mark Twain as well as I do: “Predictions aralways dangerous,
                    especially when they're about the future.”</p>
                <p>Q: Well, why don't we leave at this point, and you're coming out of the War
                    College in 1985 - TAYLOR: That's correct.</p>
                <p>

                <p>TAYLOR: I went to London.</p>

                <p>TAYLOR: I think I might have forgotten that one.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Larry, you went to London. You were in London from '85 to
                        when?</hi>

                <p>TAYLOR: To '89.</p>

                <pb facs="0075" n="Page0075"/>
                <p>TAYLOR: I did more than one thing. I started out consistent with what I had been
                    doing in Jakarta and then in Ottawa with an energy specialty, viewing the
                    geopolitics of oil and gas from the luxury of London with the myriad of contacts
                    and expertise that was there. It was a great listening post, in addition to
                    being an important oil- and gas-producing country of its own. But then half-way
                    through I became the economic counselor at the embassy, and I also had a
                    several-month TDY in which I was the staff director for the Laird Commission,
                    which had been set up to look into the security situation at embassy Moscow
                    following the discovery that some of the Marine guards had let Russian nationals
                    and probably KGB people into the embassy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, let's start first a little about the embassy's
                        structure.Who was the Ambassador in '85, when you arrived?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: Charlie Price.</p>

                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: He operated from a very lofty position in which he increasingly became
                    effective at the higher levels of British society, including with Prime Minister
                    Thatcher and many others, really did a tremendous job of networking and
                    establishing close relationships and contacts with the people who were running
                    Britain at the time. He was a very friendly and nice person to be around, but he
                    seemed to take very little interest - I think, as appropriate in a mission like
                    that - in the specific management of the embassy and its various offices and
                    functions.</p>

                <p>TAYLOR: Who later became ambassador and who had been in Britain earlier, and he
                    was just an unbelievable fountain of information, knowledge, insight, and
                    diplomatic skills with respect to the American relationship with Britain, and he
                    was a real treasure and a real pleasure to work with.</p>

                <pb facs="0076" n="Page0076"/>
                <p>TAYLOR: Well, that Britain had just passed over a significant threshold with the
                    breaking of the coal strike and the coal miners' union and the triumph of Mrs.
                    Thatcher through that crisis and, I think, began a period of clear sailing with
                    respect to Thatcherism on the economic side, and so for the four years that I
                    was there, it was a Britain that was continually on the rise economically and
                    equally important in its self-confidence, so the psychological dimension of what
                    I would deem the heyday of Thatcherism, between, say, '85 and '89, was clearly
                    apparent. In fact, by '89, when I left, it had grown into a type of hubris, in
                    which, at least intellectually and psychologically, they had overreached and
                    thought that they had invented Nirvana.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In your perspective, were we cheering this Thatcherism
                        on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: Oh, very much so. We were very closely associated with it. President
                    Reagan, Mrs. Thatcher, I think were political and philosophical soulmates. The
                    United States Embassy was very close to the government of the day, not just on
                    the economic side, because that mainly was cheerleading (we didn't have, you
                    know, a big government economic relationship with Britain - we had a big private
                    sector economic relationship with Britain), but on the international issues of
                    the day, how to deal with the Soviet Union, how to deal with terrorism, how to
                    deal with Libya in particular, Mrs. Thatcher and President Reagan were
                    co-leaders in the Western Alliance and in the process of taking the Alliance in
                    a certain direction in policy and strategic terms. So yes, we were very close to
                    that government.</p>
                <p>Q: When you talk about Reagan and Thatcher, how about the embassy, the
                    professionals in the Foreign Service? I mean obviously you've command, but were
                    they sort of with the program, too?</p>
                <p>TAYLOR: Well, to a certain extent. On the economic side, I think we all believed
                    that Britain was doing far better than it had been before Mrs. Thatcher took
                    control. I think we all believed that breaking that coal strike and, in
                    particular, breaking the political power of Arthur Scargill and his people was a
                    positive development. On the political side, it is interesting. The embassy did
                    a good job of covering the waterfront, and I think a lot of us found that the
                    Tory politicians of the day, the people who were running the place, were a bit
                    stuffy and arrogant, but we got along with them. We rather enjoyed more
                    personally the Labor politicians, who seemed more down to earth and real people,
                    but the embassy did a good job of covering the entire scene there. It was still
                    a big embassy. This was before the big downsizing that was to come six or seven
                    years later. It was probably overstaffed, but that level of staffing allowed the
                    embassy the luxury of some really excellent coverage of a whole variety of
                    issues.</p>

                        abouScottish oil, aren't we?</hi>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: North Sea oil. How did we view developments there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: Well, in what sense do you mean?</p>
                <p>Q: Well, you were the fuel attach�, or whatever you want to call it, and you've
                    got a lot of fuel coming out of the North Sea. Were we keeping an eye on it?</p>
                <p>TAYLOR: Well, we certainly kept an eye on it. It wasn't hard. It's a modern
                    economy with good solid companies, good solid government; and therefore
                    statistics and even policies and policy trends were easily knowable in a timely
                    way. There was a concern still, in 1985, when I first went there, that Britain
                    might be country that would want to go around the margins, fool around with
                    production levels and so forth in order to support a higher oil price. That
                    proved definitely not to be the case, and I think within a year everybody
                    understood that clearly; but there was some interest in that in Washington and
                    some difference of view in Washington when I went out there in '85.</p>
                <p>What London was really great for, though, was as a listening post for the world,
                    and this is why we were able to use the position I held in order to do an awful
                    lot of reporting on what we were hearing about policy developments and policy
                    trends in the Middle East, in OPEC as an organization, and in the global energy
                    market. London's just so full of so many people who are high-powered and have
                    access to information on a global basis, that the listening-post aspect of the
                    job, within a year or so, became more important than the purely domestic part of
                    it.</p>

                <p>TAYLOR: Oh, absolutely, although the embassy in Norway obviously had primary
                    responsibility for that. We were interested in Norway as a producer, but as a
                    big gas producer as well, not just the oil side, and particularly there was
                    concern and interest in Washington that Norway, even more than Britain, was
                    likely to, around the margins, adopt production and export qualities that tried
                    to support the price of oil.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0078" n="Page0078"/>
                <p>TAYLOR: Oh, yes, oh, yes. Everybody was in London or came to London, and the
                    number of international conferences at the time on these subjects that attracted
                    the global players, for one reason or another, trying to make deals and so
                    forth, and the energy seminars at the time that Robert Mabro held at Oxford on
                    international energy issues, and that Paul Frankel held, just attracted people
                    from all over the world, so it was an endless stream of the key players,
                    ministers and presidents and heads of oil companies, consultant, contractors,
                    everybody under the sun passed through London, and if you worked hard, you could
                    get to know quite a few of them.</p>
                <p>Q: What were our particular American concerns, and obviously your job, during
                    this '85-'89 period in the oil field and gas that were of particular concern to
                    the United States? You had mentioned controlled production? Were we looking at a
                    revived OPEC, or what?</p>
                <p>TAYLOR: Well, there was still concern. I think at that time there was still
                    concern as to the power of OPEC, although the sense was that it was weak and
                    getting weaker. But the key really happened, as I remember it - I may be wrong,
                    but I think it was right after I got there, in September of '85; there was
                    certainly a long stream of reporting from me on it; maybe I remember it
                    selectively and when people look at it, it won't be as interesting as I think -
                    there was a conference, one of these big conferences I referred to, and the
                    chairman, the president of the OPEC conference at the time was an Indonesian
                    energy minister, Subroto, whom I knew quite well and I knew from my time in
                    Indonesia and his advisors, and I remember he gave a speech that, in my
                    discussions with the Indonesians and other members of OPEC, I think we correctly
                    reported at the time was an absolute bellwether clear signal that OPEC was going
                    to stop supporting the price and instead go for market share. And that could
                    only mean one thing - that the price was just going to go down very
                    dramatically. And I remember being puzzled for at least two and a half months
                    while the oil price rose very sharply on the international markets, thinking, I
                    must be nuts, I just don't understand what I'm hearing, or maybe they're wrong,
                    maybe they're misleading me. But no, eventually, everybody sort of got on the
                    same wavelength, and in fact, prices collapsed in a period where nobody was
                    willing to restrain production, and the Saudis in particular wanted to go for
                    market share.So all of that was a very interesting sort of time for us as we
                    sort of had led the information and reporting that OPEC would be moving in this
                    direction and that we thought it had certain consequences for global supply and
                    demand and therefore pricing, and for a couple of months it looked like we were
                    totally and absolutely out to lunch. But then it turned out that that was
                    correct, and the market was flooded with oil, and the price came down
                    dramatically.</p>

                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: Well, it didn't play directly into what I was looking at. Another luxury
                    we had at the time, and maybe still do to some extent, is that London had a
                    couple of jobs in the Political Section that really were regional reporting
                    jobs. They used London as a listening post, too. One was on Africa, particularly
                    South Africa; the other one was on the Middle East, and particularly Gulf
                    issues. And there was an officer in the Political Section who followed Iran,
                    Iraq, and many of the same countries that I was following, but she followed it
                    from the perspective of the question you were asking, the politics and the
                    security issues associated with the Middle East. And London was a terrific
                    listening post for those as well as for the economic and oil issues.</p>

                <p>TAYLOR: Yes, as well as hers, because the Libyans had an interesting presence in
                    London, and there were a lot of people there talking to them. And so we would
                    occasionally see them at gatherings that we went to, and we would certainly be
                    talking to the people who would be talking to them all the time.</p>

                <p>TAYLOR: Not an embassy, by the way. They had a commercial presence,but it was a
                    very political commercial thing.</p>
                <p>Q: Well, did you feel, at the time, that the Libyans were trying to throw, using
                    the British term, a spanner into the works, or were they out to get money like
                    everyone else?</p>
                <p>TAYLOR: Both. I mean, the perfect situation is you throw a spanneinto the works
                    and you profit.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Again, from your perspective, how about the French? What

                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: I didn't see much of a role, except that they were really heavy, as
                    they've always been, and continue to be, on the commercial side, company and
                    government working hand-in-glove to obtain benefits, either exploration rights
                    or major projects and so forth. I thought French petroleum diplomacy was heavily
                    commercial rather than, sort of, political in its purposes.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the British? How did they react?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: I think predictably. The government of the day, which was supportive and
                    a participant in the process, was quite strongly in favor, obviously, and the
                    opposition parties, I think, raised sensible and interesting questions and
                    critiques. It was not anything that brought the British public out in
                    demonstrations in large numbers pro and con. The predictable left-wingers held a
                    few smaller ones. But it was something that was consistent with the British
                    government's policy of the day, supported and participated in in a variety of
                    ways by the British government, and which engendered an awful lot, in typical
                    British fashion, I think, of very thoughtful and critical analysis in the
                    media.</p>
                <p>Q: Did Nigeria play any particular role, because there had been that time between
                    Britain and Nigeria before on the oil side? Did that get involved?</p>
                <p>TAYLOR: Yes, and particularly inasmuch as one of the headquarters of Royal Dutch
                    Shell is in London, there on the South Bank, and the head of Shell at the time
                    had been heavily involved in Nigeria in his own background and history. So yes -
                    it wasn't a really big thing, nor at the time was there much interest in it from
                    Washington, but we did report on it, based on just conversations we would have
                    mainly with Shell.</p>

                    hard to believe today how important it seemed that staying on top of the
                    geopolitics of oil and gas was at the time, and on top of OPEC issues. And I had
                    a very strong international- (end of tape)</p>
                <p>I talked quite regularly with even the deputy assistant secretary of the State

                    and in the CIA.</p>
                <p>Q: Were there any developments in the European Economic Union ( I guess it was

                    from the Soviet Union to Western Europe, to which we - I think you've alluded to
                    it before - had taken great exception. Where was that at this point?</p>
                <p>TAYLOR: We were busy hammering nails in its coffin, I guess, trying to do that in
                    a variety of ways, although the British and we, again, sort of saw eye to eye on
                    the strategic and security aspects of that, and I think most of the action in
                    that was on the Continent, in Brussels and in Paris and the IEA, in order to
                    build a case that it really wasn't necessary and so forth.</p>

                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: Well, what I tried to do, because, again, the section was very big at the
                    time - it's probably much smaller today - what I tried to do was manage the
                    section rather than do the job myself. Now in that sense, everything that was
                    going on in the section I had a responsibility for, but what we tried to do was
                    establish priorities, strategic objectives, and make sure the officers in the
                    section were working to those priorities and toward those objectives. And a lot
                    of that really was to beef up our ability to understand what was happening in
                    Europe, in the EU, on European economic policy, through the insights that the
                    British could give us, rather than to simply manage the embassy as though our
                    job was solely to conduct the bilateral economic relationship between Britain
                    and the United States.</p>
                <p>Q: Almost everything in our relationship with Great Britain is really more than
                    bilateral, isn't it? I mean it very quickly takes on not necessarily a
                    partnership but an interest in all sorts of other areas.</p>
                <pb facs="0082" n="Page0082"/>
                <p>TAYLOR: What I found, and maybe France is the same way - I've never served in
                    France, so I'm not sure - but what I found in Britain - and it's the only other
                    country that I know of in which it is true - was a natural desire and ability to
                    think in global terms, much as U.S. foreign policy leadership does, and not to
                    just see things through the prism or a bilateral relationship or a regional
                    relationship but to think in global interests and global objectives and to
                    approach issues through those. Now that gave us an affinity and, again, a common
                    language - those things gave us an ability to have a relationship with the
                    British that I thought was quite unusual, and in the Reagan-Thatcher period it
                    was very much a partnership. For better or worse, that's what it was.</p>
                <p>Q: Were there ever times when within the embassy you'd be saying, “Damn it, I
                    wish Margaret Thatcher wouldn't keep jerking our President around,” because it
                    sounded like she was sometimes acting like almost the senior partner in the
                    thing, in that she had very fixed ideas and Reagan thought they were good.</p>
                <p>TAYLOR: And vice versa. I think they had a real affinity for each other's
                    philosophy, for the direction in which they had managed to take their countries,
                    for the sense that on a global basis the values that they cherished seemed to be
                    in the ascendancy. So I'm not sure that we felt that Mrs. Thatcher was jerking
                    President Reagan's chain, but rather that it was an unusual and strong
                    partnership that seemed to be working very well.</p>
                <p>Q: What about the British economy? Were we looking at some of the cracks in the
                    Thatcher system? Particularly, I think of the north as having rather severe
                    unemployment problems, that the south under the old rust and coal industry were
                    having problems, compared to the newer types of industry.</p>
                <p>TAYLOR: I think the record is spotty on that basis, frankly. We did recognize
                    those things, that regions were falling behind and were in disrepair, that inner
                    cities were having unusually difficult problems, American-style problems, not
                    British-style problems, that there was an income gap developing that had social
                    and political consequences. I remember starting out a cable once that London was
                    a great place to live if you were rich or a foreign diplomat, because no British
                    person unless they were rich could live in London any more, at least not in a
                    nice section of London. So these things got on the radar screen, but I do have
                    to acknowledge that, taking in the big picture, we were overwhelmingly
                    supportive of the direction the British economy was moving and of Mrs.
                    Thatcher's policies, and in retrospect I think that's right. I think the record
                    shows that that's right, but as a matter of good professional analysis and
                    performance, I probably should have anointed somebody, or played the role
                    myself, as a stronger devil's advocate, to continually challenge that view.
                    Again, I think the record shows the view was right, but we probably should have
                    subjected a more critical pattern over it before just concluding it was.</p>
                <pb facs="0083" n="Page0083"/>
                <p>Q: Were we paying any particular attention to Northern Ireland? I'm thinking from
                    an economic point of view, because the Irish problem, which is certainly looking
                    better as of the last week or so, in 1998, but Northern Ireland had a lot of
                    these industries that were going down, shipbuilding and things of this nature.
                    Were we looking at it, concerned, trying to do anything about helping?</p>
                <p>TAYLOR: Just a little bit. Clearly the peace process there, for what ever it is
                    at the time, the security situation, was the dominant fact of the way we
                    approached Northern Ireland. We recognized what was happening in the economy,
                    and in a few isolated cases where there was an American commercial interest at
                    stake we did advocate it, either as an investment or in some way, but the
                    economic dimension of Northern Ireland, which is really what you're asking
                    about, was not well integrated into the embassy's approach to Northern Ireland.
                    It sort of was like a little dangling participle off to the side.</p>
                <p>

                        thaparticularly got you involved?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: Well, there were just so many exciting things going on continuously in
                    London. I think we did do a really good job of evaluating the European single
                    market concept through our access to British thinking and information that we
                    could obtain in London. I think we did a really good job, along with other
                    embassies, but it was right at the beginning, where we really started covering
                    intensely the EEU through the period of the rotating presidency of the EEU. And
                    I think we did set a great example of how to do that during the presidency
                    period. The only other thing that happened to me while I was there that is known
                    - that I mentioned earlier - is that I was pulled out for several months to do
                    this special job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could we talk about your time with the Laird-</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: Commission.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: -Commission about our embassy in Moscow? Could you explain
                        whaled up to it and then what you all observed and did?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0084" n="Page0084"/>
                <p>TAYLOR: Well, you'll recall there appeared in the media as well as in government
                    sources the recognition that something had gone wrong in our security posture at
                    our embassy in Moscow, and it seemed to have a relationship to one or more
                    Marine guards who, for whatever reason, had been letting Russian nationals into
                    the embassy late at night and unsupervised, and that these nationals, at least
                    some of them, had probably been Russian intelligence agents. That became such a
                    big issue that the President appointed a special commission to look into the
                    situation and to make recommendations about the security situation there, a
                    former congressman and Secretary oDefense, Melvin Laird, was named the head of
                    that commission, and I don't know exactly how, but in the cascade of further
                    appointments and so forth, I came to be asked to be the staff director of the
                    commission, of the 10 or 12 staff members who were assembled to research and
                    analyze and write the segments of the report that was in their specialty. I came
                    back from London to do that and did that for several months.</p>
                <p>It was a fascinating process, both with respect to learning how these commissions
                    work in Washington but also with respect to the substance of the issue under
                    study, and that is the security situation in Moscow.</p>
                <p>Q: Tell me, what was your impression; here you were with one of these full-blown
                    special commissions. How did it operate, and what was the real purpose of
                    it?</p>
                <p>TAYLOR: Well, the real purpose was exactly what was stated, I believe. Of course,
                    all of these commissions serve some sort of purpose of taking the head off the
                    issue of the moment so that the authorities can state they've done their job,
                    they've set up some high-powered process to get on top of it. That certainly was
                    involved. But I think there was a desire to get on top of this one. It was a
                    very sensitive issue. The State Department was sensitive about it. The Marine
                    Corps was sensitive about it. The people involved in our embassy were sensitive
                    about it, and the people involved in Washington were sensitive about it. And I
                    think they all needed a kind of professional and legitimate process in which to
                    channel those concerns and those emotions and in which, I hope, to have some
                    faith that the result would be objective. It was a real experience. Some tried
                    to avoid responsibility. Some tried to pass the buck. Most tried to do the right
                    thing, identifying ways to improve. I remember, though, one person was a real
                    standout, a true leader - Roz Ridgway, who was assistant secretary in EUR.</p>
                <p>Q: Well, were we looking beyond whether just these KGB people planted mikes and
                    took pictures of it? I mean there was some concern about overall penetration of
                    the embassy. Were we building the new one at that time?</p>
                <p>TAYLOR: Yes, we sure were.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And did that come into your purview?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0085" n="Page0085"/>
                <p>TAYLOR: Yes, you know, establishing the facts of what happened was, I think, the
                    least important of the Laird Commission's work, and that was largely done
                    through secondary sources, as it had to be anyhow. What the Commission's report
                    focused on was to get behind all of that and look at the systems and process
                    that we had in place for our security and ask where we had missed
                    vulnerabilities and, if we had, why, and to try to derive lessons learned so
                    that, going forward, those vulnerabilities would be eliminated and we would have
                    a stronger security situation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it from this Commission that we decided to do away
                        witSoviet nationals in our embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: I think they'd already been done away with.</p>
                <p>Q: Because many of us in the Foreign Service who have served in Communist
                    countries have felt that having foreign nationals, even if they are assigned
                    from the local Communist authorities, still give us a window. They are a handy
                    group of people to have around, and once you know you've got to be careful
                    around them, it's pretty obvious, but when you bring in a bunch of people, sort
                    of working-class Americans, to do things in the embassy, you're opening yourself
                    up to even worse problems. I mean all of us have experienced that. You tend to
                    have lone males who want to go out and drink at night and that sort of
                    thing.</p>
                <p>TAYLOR: Right, yes. Again, I think that decision about the employment of Russian
                    nationals had been made already. It may have been a swing-of-the-pendulum type
                    of decision, but I think the point was, even if that's the case, that the
                    situation in Moscow had been recognized as so risky that it demanded some sort
                    of action, and that fell in the actionable category. Whether it's a long-term
                    solution, that's another story. Whether there aren't minuses as well as pluses
                    to that approach, clearly there are. But there was a more interesting idea at
                    the time, which was to have separate buildings to separate classified and
                    unclassified functions. And one of the difficulties, when you see the structure
                    in Moscow, is how small and cramped the conditions were under which people had
                    to work and how difficult in that overall situation it must have been to
                    maintain the proper separation. If the remedy is to get rid of the Russian
                    nationals is another question, and a number of ideas were presented, that we
                    needed to construct facilities that would be classified and unclassified, only
                    employ the host nationals in these sorts of countries in the unclassified
                    portion of the facility. So one way or another we had to come to grips with a
                    situation that had broken down in Moscow.</p>
                <p>Q: Was there any thought of, in some of the more critical areas such as, in those
                    days, the Communist countries, of moving to a different type of system than the
                    Marine guard system, because essentially you're putting men, and sometimes young
                    women, into these sensitive positions where the British and others seem to use
                    sort of retired warrant officers and retired sergeants or something, often
                    family men, which would seem to make more sense.</p>
                <pb facs="0086" n="Page0086"/>
                <p>TAYLOR: There was certainly intellectual consideration of those alternatives. I
                    don't think there was any real political consideration of them. I may be wrong
                    about that, but it seemed to be a more academic discussion than a realistic
                    discussion. But they were all out on the table, and certainly the British model
                    that you mentioned, we clearly went through all of that and saw the advantages
                    to it that you've mentioned. I will say one thing, though, and it's pretty
                    clear, and I don't want to get into the classified portions of the report or
                    anything - it's pretty clear that the Marine security guard situation in Moscow
                    had broken down seriously, and broken down in more ways, more fundamental ways,
                    than just the one or two marines who had been associated with letting Russians
                    into the embassy. It was a situation that was out of control in many respects.
                    But one of the most impressive things that I saw in my time and subsequently on
                    this commission was how the Marine Corps learned the lessons of that and made
                    changes, made positive changes that would eliminate those sorts of situations or
                    greatly reduce them (you can never eliminate them with the people variable
                    there) and greatly strengthen the role of the Marine guard system. It was a
                    wonderful example, in the end - not at the beginning, because I think there was
                    some effort at the beginning, unfortunately, to pass the buck to some State
                    Department people on this that, whatever level of responsibility they had, they
                    didn't have that level of responsibility - but at the end, the Marine Corps got
                    the right message themselves, learned the lessons, and made fundamental changes
                    in their recruiting and their training and their monitoring and supervision of
                    the Marine security guard system, and I really take my hat off to them for doing
                    that.</p>

                <p>TAYLOR: Well, “many” is the answer to that. You've got to manage the economic
                    section; you've got to work within an interagency structure in Ottawa of a
                    number of economic agencies and players to get a cohesive and strategic product
                    and program for the U.S. government; you've got to work closely with the

                    way your section and the way you operate. And we have a very large number of
                    consulates in Canada - it's a decentralized society and economy - that have very
                    important economic dimensions to their consular districts, and you have to work
                    with the principal officers in all of those consulates on a number of economic
                    issues.</p>
                <p>Now, those are all sort of process and relationship answers to your question.
                    There was one overriding task at the time I was there, which was to get a really
                    strong and effective implementation of the recently negotiated U.S.-Canada
                    Free-Trade Agreement, which was still extraordinarily controversial and
                    unpopular in Canada.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before we move to that, who was the ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: The Ambassador was Ed Ney, who was the former chairman oYoung and
                    Rubicam, a political appointee by President Bush.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: N-e-y? TAYLOR: N-e-y, yes, like Marshall Ney, that's
                        right.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did he operate?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: He operated first by being an incredibly hard worker at all levels. He
                    worked hard at establishing a relationship with his normal contacts in the
                    Canadian government and Canadian society, and he worked hard at getting on top
                    of the way an embassy functioned and establishing priorities and trying to move
                    the embassy functions in the directions that he believed were the most
                    important. I liked Ambassador Ney very much, and he's a good personal friend
                    today. One of the stories I'll tell you was when we first prepared the Mission
                    Program Plan - you know what that is, a huge document that matches resources and
                    priorities - it went down to him for signature. It was about 23 pages long. It
                    took him about five minutes to stroll out of his office and call us all together
                    and inform us that he'd only been the chairman of a very large private sector
                    organization and that any organization that had its priorities on more than one
                    page simply didn't have any priorities because it had too many and, therefore,
                    it couldn't focus. And he wanted to see the Mission Program Plan on one
                    page.</p>
                <pb facs="0088" n="Page0088"/>
                <p>After a week of heartache, the 23-page Mission telegram had become a 21�-page
                    telegram, and there wasn't going to be any further reduction without violence in
                    the embassy, and that was sent back to him. Well, he couldn't... So he came out
                    and informed us that he would go ahead and write his own Mission Program Plan on
                    one page and called me down about three hours later and showed me his one-page
                    Mission Program Plan. It was very interesting. It was on one page. It had five
                    priorities. They were all completely understandable and actionable. It was not
                    written in good Foreign Service language. I mean, you know, it didn't have all
                    the nuances and the flow and so forth, so I said, let me have a shot at this,
                    and I took it upstairs, and I just took his exact ideas and put them in more
                    fluent Foreign Service language and brought it back down to him, and once he had
                    that he was very happy with it. And he sent it out to Washington in a cable and
                    sent it out to all the principal officers and gave it to every section chief in
                    the embassy and said, “Go ahead now, send in your 21�-page cable because some
                    bureaucrat in Washington might need it, but this is the real plan. You guys
                    organize, prioritize, and make this work.” And I have to say, if you could find
                    one person in the whole world who remembers anything that was in the 21�-page
                    plan, I'll - give you my house. I'll give it to you. There's also about a score
                    of people who could probably remember all five of the priorities he had on one
                    page, and certainly one or two of them. It was a much better product, in terms
                    of being actionable. It had no bureaucratic value, the way the other thing did,
                    but in terms of what we did in Canada; USIS [U.S. Information Service] redid its
                    whole plan to fit into those five priorities; consulates redid reporting plans
                    and representation plans. It was very good and very actionable, and it taught me
                    a very good lesson.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were some of the priorities?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: First priority was strong and effective implementation othe U.S.-Canada
                    Free Trade Agreement, just what I thought it should be.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, what was the status of the Free Trade Agreement when
                        yoarrived in '89?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: It was a done deal, signed, delivered, and ratified, but brand-new and as
                    yet untested and still very controversial in Canada. And that was at a time in
                    the economic cycle where things were not all that robust in the United States,
                    but they were less robust in Canada and would be moving, not dramatically
                    downward, but gradually downward over the next two or three years - I mean the
                    little mini-recession that killed George Bush, in a sense, was even deeper in
                    Canada, and that led the critics of the Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement to come
                    out of every bush and from behind every tree to claim that the downturn there
                    was not just associated with but was a result of the U.S.-Canada Free Trade
                    Agreement.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0089" n="Page0089"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was sort of the feeling in Canada, as you were
                        monitoring it, about this free trade agreement? Was it a particularly
                        popular one, or was this... It was Mulroney, wasn't it? He was the -</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: Yes, Mulroney was the Prime Minister.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this felt to be something the Americans put over on
                        thCanadians? I mean, what were you getting?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: Well, it was very controversial, and probably the majority of voters in
                    Canada were critical or suspicious or negative about it. You know, U.S.-Canada
                    free trade has a long history in our relationship, and that idea has been
                    squelched often in the past, usually by Canadian leaders who are symbols of
                    Canadian nationalism and sovereignty standing up and certainly protecting Canada
                    from being swallowed up by this huge economy and social system and culture to
                    the south of it. And so in those portions of the country that subscribe to this
                    sort of view of the United States and this sort of nationalist definition of
                    being Canadian, this agreement was very unpopular. So that included large
                    sections of Ontario, by far the most populous province, but the Free Trade
                    Agreement was popular in Quebec, which just has to be different from Ontario no
                    matter what, and it was popular out west in Alberta as well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, did you find yourself having to go around saying
                        “Gee, thiis a great thing?”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: Well Ambassador Ney wanted me to do that, and I kind of resisted that
                    because I felt that I represented the American government, and I didn't mind
                    going around talking about the U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement, but it didn't
                    seem to me that my role was to be a cheerleader for Canadian political
                    decisions. I thought Canadian ministers and government officials, my counterpart
                    in the Foreign Ministry and in other ministries, should go around and make that
                    case to the Canadian public and that my job was, frankly, to make sure that it
                    got implemented in a professional and strong and effective way that protected
                    American interests. And I really didn't want to sort of get on the line of
                    trying to say this is a good deal for you. I mean, that's for them to decide. I
                    wanted to make sure it was a good deal for us. It is a win-win deal. It opens
                    markets. It creates new opportunities for players on both sides of the border,
                    reduced bottlenecks and impediments to trade, so both countries should win. And
                    I'm perfectly comfortable explaining that concept and that theory, but I did not
                    want to become a cheerleader for the Canadian government and particularly for a
                    government that itself was reluctant to step out and defend the agreement.</p>
                <p>Q: How did you feel with the various ministers and their subordinates in the
                    Canadian government? Were they looking at this agreement as a political
                    document, or were they looking hard at the economics of it?</p>
                <pb facs="0090" n="Page0090"/>
                <p>TAYLOR: I think both, and they knew that the economy was in a shape that was
                    going to cause criticism for this agreement, but that's cyclical and short-term,
                    so they didn't want too run out and get in the way of that tidal wave. It think
                    the government that negotiated this and signed it fundamentally believed that
                    was in the long-term interests of Canada to do this and that Canada would
                    greatly benefit from entering into this whole new relationship in North America,
                    and these people were content to let time show that that would be the case and
                    not to get caught up in today's newspaper headline or next week's economic
                    statistic, so in a way, I think they adopted a sound strategy for the
                    circumstance of the moment.</p>
                <p>Also, they had other priorities. They had just signed this agreement they were
                    confident in the long run would be validated by circumstances and events, but at
                    the time, their country was crumbling apart again. It was the old Quebec-English
                    Canada issue, and I think rather than sort of cheerlead for an agreement he'd
                    already signed, the Prime Minister and the government of the day felt they'd
                    better get on and deal with the Quebec question.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the intellectual community?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: Oh, totally against it, totally against it. Again, Quebec would be an
                    exception, but again, the intellectual fountainhead of Canada in Ontario, in the
                    University of Toronto and all of their world-class authors and so on - they were
                    very much against it as a sellout of Canadian identity, Canadian nationalism,
                    Canadian culture.</p>
                <p>Q: What about the cultural issue? I mean, this has been something that's gone on
                    for so long, basically the American spillover of its TV, it's magazines, media,
                    and all that into the Canadian thing. Was this a problem for you?</p>
                <p>TAYLOR: Oh, it was a big work issue, absolutely, because most of these protective
                    measures we deemed barriers to trade and investment, and so we just came at the
                    same situation from a different perspective. Now, I'll tell you, Stu, I have a
                    lot of sympathy for Canadians' concerns that they have a unique and precious
                    culture and that they want to maintain and even enhance it. The point that I
                    tried to leave them with all the time is they were doing so in what I considered
                    a 19th and early 20th century fashion and what they needed to think about was
                    doing so in some sort of 21st century fashion because all of these border
                    controls and legal restrictions, if they made any sense at all at any time,
                    could make no sense in a period of time when technology was shifting so rapidly
                    that any Canadian citizen in a few years (then - by now it is the case) could go
                    down to Radio Shack and buy a little box, put it no top of their television, and
                    beam in anything they wanted no matter what they said along the border. No
                    matter if they lined up the Royal Canadian Mounted Police from one end of the
                    country, it's still going to come in.</p>
                <pb facs="0091" n="Page0091"/>
                <p>And really what they had to think about doing was getting away from these
                    anachronistic and antiquated ideas of protectionism and try to help promote and
                    foster a culture that was so good that it was competitive on a global basis,
                    that it didn't need to exist in a 50-mile-long strip along our northern border,
                    it could produce senses of identity and symbols of identity and programs and
                    content that people south or the border and in Europe and Asia would relate to
                    and say, “Isn't that good - it's Canadian.” I don't know. Some Canadians thought
                    that was the way to go, to look forward rather than looking back, but there's a
                    lot of inertia there, and it had a deep root, especially in central Canada's
                    identity, that if you open up in one generation we'll all be Americans, and
                    that's something we don't want to do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have a different set of problems with the people
                        froQuebec? What do you call them, the Qu�b�cois or Quebeckers?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: Yes, either one.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have a different focus with them?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0092" n="Page0092"/>
                <p>TAYLOR: Well, again, we have two consulates, a consulate general in Montreal and
                    one in Quebec City, and the embassy was located right along the river. You drive
                    across the bridge and you're in Quebec. And that is the dominant domestic
                    political issue. So that's something that all the embassy was aware of and
                    worked on, the political section, of course, more than anyone, but we were all
                    involved in it in some way. Now I think it is true that Quebeckers have an
                    affinity for the United States, in part to balance off their sort of tension
                    with Ontario and English Canada. The Quebec energy industry, the hydroelectric
                    industry, is financed and tied to the United States in a number of ways, and
                    there is a kind of booming trade between Quebec and the parts of the United
                    States that are to the south of it. So there's a lot of purely economic and
                    commercial dimensions to it, but they're not abnormal. They're what you would
                    expect, given the geography and the state of development in the region. I think
                    the overriding issue there is the future of Quebec within Canada, and the issue
                    I worked on from the Economic Section most closely was a point of view that came
                    out of Washington which I radically disagreed with. There was an analysis done
                    in Washington, the bottom line of which was that Quebec could not economically
                    afford to be independent, and that is nutty. That is such a nutty point of view.
                    Of course it can afford to be independent if it wishes. There may be costs, but
                    it may wish to pay them. You know, I was ambassador in Estonia, and I can still
                    look at the documents in which the Russians said, “Well, Estonia, Latvia, and
                    Lithuania, they'll never be independent; they're too small to be independent;
                    they can't afford to go it alone.” Well, they're doing much better than Russia,
                    thank you very much - much, much better. And Quebec could easily afford to go it
                    alone. So I did an awful lot of work on sort of saying, “I'm not predicting
                    Quebec's going to go it alone, but if you're relying on an argument that
                    economically it can't afford to and therefore will not, you have a flawed
                    argument, and that's not one that we here at the embassy subscribe to.”</p>

                <p>TAYLOR: I thought it was self-serving, and I thought it was people who really
                    didn't understand economics at all reaching for an easy answer to a complicated
                    problem.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was our response to this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: Well we followed it very closely, I mean, incredibly closely, and we have
                    very good contacts, and Canada is an open country, and everybody spoke to us and
                    wanted us to know what was going on. So an immense amount, a steady stream of
                    reporting, very good, accurate reporting, and it was headlines in Canada, it was
                    the be-all and end-all of the six o'clock news for months and so many strange
                    twists and turns, so it was a fascinating story. I think the U.S. position on
                    this issue has always been that we value and support a strong and united Canada,
                    but that Canada's political future is up to Canadians to decide. Now you don't
                    have to be a mind-reader or a genius to know that means we'd like to see Canada
                    stay together because that's just the best possible outcome for the United
                    States, and all of us, therefore, were hoping that things like the Meech Lake
                    Accord would work in satisfying the differing aspirations and expectations of
                    Canada's diverse people, and I think it came close, but through a variety of
                    unbelievable situations - and some fundamental flaws that sat beneath it - it
                    did not pass, and now we sit... You know, it's important to understand - again,
                    people will differ, and I'm not an expert on the Meech Lake Accord, that was for
                    the Political Section to evaluate - in my view the Meech Lake Accord in no way
                    would have solved the fundamental problems of French and English Canada. What it
                    would have done is it would have channeled those tensions and disagreements and
                    conflicts into a legal channel for a generation. It would have provided a new
                    road in which to quarrel and fight, but a road that would have kept Quebec in
                    the system while it did so, and that's what was lost, in my view, a long term
                    process, sort of conflict resolution, that would have prevented, at least for a
                    long time, any sort of movement toward ultimate breakup. It wasn't that Meech
                    Lake would have solved these things; it just would have moved it in a more
                    healthy and more constructive channel than the one that it happened to in. But
                    that opportunity was lost, and so we sit here today now, you know, people
                    talking about another referendum sometime soon.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the feeling about Mulroney at the embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: Well, again, he and President Reagan had, I think, a close relationship,
                    shared a philosophy. I think those of us who followed the system and who knew
                    Canada fairly well - I mean, I'd been there at that point almost seven years
                    toward the end and had a lot of Canadian friends - knew that Mulroney was
                    terribly unpopular in Canada and couldn't win reelection and so forth, but I
                    thought the relationship with the United States was extremely good while he was
                    Prime Minister.</p>
                <p>Q: What about the Maritime Provinces? You know, whenever you talk about Quebec
                    breaking away, you've got those provinces out there which are not
                    self-sufficient.</p>
                <p>TAYLOR: Yes, you're absolutely right.</p>
                <pb facs="0094" n="Page0094"/>
                <p>Q: And in a way, one can almost, I mean, you have the feeling that everyone in
                    Canada looks sort of towards us and says, well, what are you going to do about
                    them?</p>
                <p>TAYLOR: Yes, there is a lot of that. Let me tell you, the point I made earlier
                    about trying to deal with this idea in Washington that Quebec couldn't afford to
                    separate, which I think is absolutely wrong. At the end of my analysis I came to
                    the point you're making - but it's more than the Maritime Provinces - and argued
                    instead, at least for argumentation's sake, not in a conclusive sense, that
                    Canada couldn't survive without Quebec, that if Quebec went, it was not Quebec
                    that was going to fall apart, it was the rest of Canada that would fall apart,
                    and it began in the Maritimes, that they would crumble. So I think your point is
                    an extremely good one, and I think that it's a huge unanswered question what the
                    ripple effects would be in Canada if Quebec were to obtain its sovereignty, and
                    I suspect there would be a movement in some provinces to try to join the United
                    States, bizarre as that may seem to us -</p>

                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: Sure, it already exists, that the people in Nova Scotia feel a lot closer
                    to the people in Boston than they do to people in Vancouver, and vice versa.
                    People in Boston feel closer to people in Nova Scotia than they do in San Diego
                    in many respects. So you remember that book The Nine Nations of North America,
                    that has this map on it and says, sure, there's three political nations here,
                    but what you've got is nine social and cultural and economic entities, and North
                    Atlantic North America is one of those, sure.</p>
                <p>Still, you know, I don't think they'd be very happy as part of the United States.
                    They think Ottawa is overbearing in this tremendously decentralized system. They
                    have no idea what [laughter] overbearing is really like once they joined the
                    United States!</p>
                <p>Q: Yes, I mean it's not as though one were sitting there plotting; in fact, it's
                    like seeing your neighbor's house fall apart and saying, my God, who's going to
                    weed the yard next door? Somebody's got to do it.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's a remarkable thing that's happening. Could you talk
                        abouhow we saw that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: Well, I think we just saw it. I'm not sure that we had a judgment about
                    it at the time in terms of what it meant for U.S. interests, except to some
                    extent it was a lot of money - and people - who for one reason or another
                    couldn't locate in the U.S., which might have been their first preference,
                    finding a way to do so in Canada. But we have, still have and had at the time,
                    an extraordinarily effective consul general in Vancouver and one in Calgary as
                    well, and as the economic minister at the embassy, I traveled out there a lot
                    and worked very closely with them on these sorts of things. We saw it as a
                    trend; they saw it in sort of nuts and bolts terms, right where they lived every
                    day in terms of the effects on the economy and immigration and property values
                    and so forth. So that was something we were clearly on top of.</p>
                <p>Q: In many ways this continues today. Canada, with all its problems, is an
                    extremely dynamic and changing place, and everything that happens there has some
                    repercussions. Did you find yourself having to sort of monitor our states along
                    the border?</p>
                <p>TAYLOR: What an interesting question. When I first went there, back in the early
                    '80s, there was actually a position established, as well as one in Mexico, I
                    believe. The officer worked exclusively- (end of tape)</p>
                <pb facs="0096" n="Page0096"/>
                <p>-to just work on regional relations, state, provincial, and border community
                    relations because so many of the decisions in the U.S.-Canadian relationship are
                    made at that level without any reference to Washington or Ottawa whatsoever, and
                    I thought it was a terrifically innovative idea. It fell victim to budget cuts
                    and priorities. It may be time to bring that back, though, in my view, given the
                    way the economy and social systems are developing. But the state and provincial
                    relationships, regional governors and provincial premier conferences, and so
                    forth are just absolutely critical. Now they're generally covered out of the
                    relevant consulates general now, so that our consuls general in Halifax will go
                    to the Maritime Provincial and New England governors conference and so forth;
                    same thing out on the West Coast. But it's a fascinating thing. In fact, I
                    remember back in the early 1980s, just to regress back into the period of the
                    national energy program, Larry Eagleburger, who at that time was assistant
                    secretary for European affairs, I believe, gave this speech in New York in which
                    he claimed, rightly, that U.S.-Canadian relations were falling into an abyss as
                    a result of the implications of the National Energy Program, and that's sort of
                    what they were. And I remember a senior official in the Canadian Foreign
                    Ministry mention to me at dinner, he said, “Larry, relations between our two
                    countries have never been worse.” And my response was then we ought to be
                    ashamed of ourselves because the average Canadian and the average American who
                    cross this border millions of times a week and who have the world's largest
                    commercial relationship don't know that, and somehow we're not meeting the
                    standard they're setting, so why don't we start to get with it? And the point
                    is, I think, what you've just mentioned, that the U.S. Canadian relationship is
                    a whale of a lot more than the diplomatic and government-to-government
                    relationship, and those of us who work in the government-to-government channel
                    really need to keep that in mind and not think that we're the center of the
                    universe in that relationship.</p>

                    had a big bang before it collapsed - the National Energy Program, FIRA (the
                    Foreign Investment Review Agency), everything was made in Canada, “be
                    Canadianized,” Canadian ownership - it was Pierre Trudeau's last effort, and if
                    oil prices had gone up, he might have gotten away with it. But they went down,

                    by '89-92 it's still in my bailiwick, but it wasn't an issue. Now in the earlier
                    period, thank goodness, that the commercial partners and the regulatory
                    authorities at the National Energy Board in Canada and down here in FERC and ERA
                    at the time, before ERA went out of business, were run by very sensible,
                    pragmatic people who refused to let this political ideology and philosophy get
                    in the way of making sane, sensible decisions. So the on-the-ground practical
                    cooperation in the pipeline business and in the cable or transmission business
                    and so forth was not affected by these sort of big policy and political

                <p>TAYLOR: Well, first, at least while I was there, and it's just a personal style,
                    I have a very aggressive outreach to the media. I try to know all the key
                    reporters in the area for which I'm responsible and make sure I have good
                    relationships with them. Now some of them have their own agenda, and it's not
                    going to work. But most of them are delighted, and I have to say that in both
                    '80 to 84 and in '89 to 92, our position on the issues for which I was
                    responsible were continuously and fairly represented in the mainstream Canadian
                    media. I thought that went with my job, to be sure that that happened. Now
                    editorializing on big things like the Free Trade Agreement, that was always
                    going to be sensitive and touchy, but I tried to make sure that it was balanced
                    somewhat by sort of talking with us at the embassy and getting our view.</p>

                <pb facs="0098" n="Page0098"/>
                <p>TAYLOR: Yes, it was on track. It had some teething problems in some of its
                    mechanisms, but that's to be expected. You just work them out. You work them out
                    together, and make the thing work and go forward. There were no real problems
                    with the Free Trade Agreement. It can't solve everything. Some issues are too
                    big to be solved by it or too sensitive, but what it did was it opened up
                    opportunities in trade and investment that didn't exist before, to entrepreneurs
                    and companies on both sides of the border and established dispute resolution
                    mechanisms that were mutually agreed, that while they didn't cover 100 percent
                    of the issues, and couldn't, covered an awful lot of them and provided for a
                    professional, mutually recognized way of coming to a bottom line about how to
                    proceed in areas where we couldn't do that previously.</p>
                <p>Q: Well, were you looking around for business opportunities for Americans in
                    Canada? Were the Canadians or their equivalent doing the same for Canadians? Or
                    were you sort of letting gravity take care of that situation?</p>
                <p>TAYLOR: Well, more the latter. I do remember that when Larry Eagleburger, I
                    think, was deputy secretary - I think this was '89-92, he sent out a worldwide
                    cable from him to ambassadors saying get in there and promote American goods.
                    That's at the top of your agenda and make sure it's done. I remember Ambassador
                    Ney called me down and he showed me this cable, and he said, “What am I going to
                    do? Politicians here don't make decisions about American goods.” I said give me
                    this, I wrote him a nice thing to send back. Of course we had a much stronger
                    argument - we didn't live in a country where you had to go in and twist arms on
                    a project-by-project, trade-by-trade agenda. We lived were in a country where we
                    liberalized the whole damn economy through the [North American] Free Trade
                    Agreement [NAFTA] and through its effective implementation. We didn't just get
                    one deal or this trade deal, we got billions and billions of dollars and
                    thousands and thousands of new deals through changing the rules of the game, and
                    that's a much more ambitious and a much stronger way to approach these things
                    when you're in a country that's willing to do that. Now if you're in Indonesia
                    at the time, or something like that, you've got to go in and twist arms on a
                    deal-by-deal basis. Yes, we tried to affect the rules of the game in ways then
                    that the weight of gravity gave American companies then many, many more
                    opportunities than they could have had previously. And I think the embassy
                    there, in the period I was there and the previous period, just did a
                    tremendously successful job of that, and then toward the end of my time,
                    Ambassador Ney made quite a strong point, and I think it was very effective,
                    when President Bush announced there would be a free-trade agreement between -
                    you can go back and read President Bush's announcement on the free trade
                    agreement with Mexico. It was announced as a bilateral agreement. And I think Ed
                    Ney was one of the first - of course, it became a bandwagon, but he was one of
                    the first - to go in and say no, Mr. President, we need a NAFTA, It's got to be
                    Canada, U.S., and Mexico, and so taking the Canada-U.S. agreement, not just as a
                    great achievement (which is was) but then as a stepping-stone to the NAFTA, was
                    sort of what dominated the last eight months or so of my time there, and
                    Ambassador Ney was extremely effective in working with Washington in promoting
                    that.</p>

                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: It was ho-hum.</p>

                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: Yes, because there's so little trade between Canada and Mexico, they did
                    not immediately see they needed to be in this, which was a little disconcerting
                    for Ambassador Ney's and the embassy's argument that this should be a three-way
                    agreement, when one of the parties was a little slow to get out of the starting
                    blocks. But again, it was just a question of timing. After a little while, as
                    soon as the idea started to percolate around, the leadership there grabbed on
                    real quick. They'd better be in on this or they were going to get left out-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Right.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: And that what would happen is there would be a hub-and-spoke system in
                    which the United States would be the hub and there would just be a series of
                    bilateral agreements.</p>

                    were particularly problems either way that you recall during this?</p>
                <p>TAYLOR: Listen, sure, this is one of the big educational things, and again, I
                    thought it was handled beautifully. It is a model. In the negotiations for the
                    free trade agreement and then for the NAFTA, USTR and the whole establishment,
                    USTR as the lead -</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The U.S. Trade Representative.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: Yes, and you know, it was Carla Hills back in the days when I was there -
                    but really set up a whole process of engaging American industry and American
                    workers to give them an avenue to make their views known and the bring them
                    along. If we hadn't done that, these things couldn't have... I mean, they may
                    have been good ideas economically; they would have been dead politically. It was
                    an absolute political prerequisite. I thought it was done beautifully. And so
                    these industry consuls and advisory groups and participation were all a part of
                    the process, and an essential part of the process.</p>
                <pb facs="0100" n="Page0100"/>
                <p>Q: Well, were you watching with a certain amount of trepidation that concerned
                    that we might be too successful in getting American business into Canada? You
                    know, it had to be pretty sure that Canadian businesses got into the United
                    States; otherwise we'd have a real problem.</p>
                <p>TAYLOR: No, again, I think here what you do is you open opportunities, and then
                    you let the chips fall where they may. Once you start to be worried about how
                    the chips are falling, that's a degree of micro-management that I would be
                    uncomfortable with in a relationship like the U.S. and Canada. If Canada isn't
                    strong enough and big enough to be able to play under the new rules, then it
                    shouldn't agree to them. That's why I didn't want to go out and defend the
                    agreement in Canada as good from Canada's point of view. It creates reciprocal
                    and equal opportunities, but they have to be taken advantage of, and I think
                    experience has shown that the Canadians have been able to step up to the plate
                    and handle those opportunities.</p>
                <p>Q: Well, was there any concern that the Canadians might have been used to a too
                    cozy relationship and that this might have dulled their competitiveness when
                    they had to come in and play games in the United States?</p>
                <p>TAYLOR: They had been too used to a cozy relationship, but I think, fortunately,
                    they developed a vision of Canada at just the right time, a Canada that, if it
                    was going to be competitive, looking ahead into the 21st century, had to set
                    sail, had to have the courage and the confidence to move away from its sheltered
                    shores and take on some bigger risks for the sake of the bigger opportunities.
                    If you look at the way the global economy has accelerated in the last 10 years,
                    if Canada had rejected the U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement, it would have
                    condemned itself to a degree of second-class performance in the world economy
                    that was unnecessary.</p>

                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: Always, always up in Canada.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Any problems, particular problems, during the time you
                        were othe country team there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: Always, because of the differences that the two governments have in their
                    approach to Cuba and then because there's American investment or ownership in
                    some Canadian companies, but companies located in and operating out of Canada,
                    which laws are they supposed to follow? But it never exploded to the point where
                    it became a crisis. It's just one of these burrs under the saddles that rubs you
                    the wrong way when, on occasion, you have to deal with it and move on. So that's
                    still - I just saw in the news the other night that senior U.S. officials were
                    briefing the media about their unhappiness that the Canadian Prime Minister is
                    going to Cuba soon. Maybe he's there already, I don't know. So that's still an
                    irritant.</p>
                <pb facs="0101" n="Page0101"/>
                <p>Q: What was our analysis at that time? Was Cuba really an issue, or was this one
                    place where you showed that, by God, you were Canadian and had a different
                    policy? Or were the Canadians really interested?</p>
                <p>TAYLOR: No, they were interested, and it was both. There was a lot in
                    intellectual circles and in Canadian nationalist circles. There was some
                    sympathy for some guy in Cuba that would stand up and poke American culture and
                    the American economy and the American political system in the eye, but some of
                    it was just occasionally “We're Canadians - we've got to have a different
                    position on something than the American do, and we've got to be able to get away
                    with it occasionally, too.” So that dimension was in there as well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, Larry, was there anything else we should cover, do
                        yothink, on Canada?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: No, it's a great country. You never hear about it when you're down here
                    south of the border, but when you're up there you've got a lot of nice people, a
                    unique culture, and a lot of interesting issues. And I think I mentioned in the
                    first period that it was probably the nicest family community, from middle-class
                    American values and standards, that we've ever had the pleasure of living in.
                    We've still got a lot of friends up there, and I certainly enjoyed my time
                    there, and I think I was lucky that I got to work on two big issues, the
                    National Energy Program and FIRA and Trudeau's last gasp of social federalism in
                    Canada in the earlier period, and then the U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement and
                    the NAFTA in the second period. So it was a good experience.</p>

                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: Well, actually, I was appointed the director of the Foreign Service
                    Institute. When I took over the Foreign Service Institute, this was just a hole
                    in the ground. We were still down in Rosslyn, and I was lucky enough to be the
                    director at a time to build this place and inaugurate it and get it started, so
                    I came 18 months before the inauguration and I stayed 18 months after the
                    inauguration. I got to play that transitional role, building on the good work my
                    predecessors had done, and then handed the baton on to my successors. But when I
                    came, this wasn't here. We were still down in Rosslyn.</p>

                <p>***</p>
                <pb facs="0102" n="Page0102"/>
                <p>Today is the 23rd of April, 1998. Larry, let's call it the FSI. I don't feel
                    comfortable with these other names, but those who want to call it the National
                    Foreign Affairs Training Center [NFATC], you might talk about the name change
                    and what was behind it. But before we get to that, what prompted them to pick
                    you, because often it had gone to somebody who had the rank of ambassador -
                    sometimes you had the feeling it was, you know, an honorific for somebody - and
                    others took it, it had a couple of directors who really took it and ran with it,
                    Steve Low, particularly, and Brandon Grove later, but how come you?</p>
                <p>TAYLOR: Well, I'll answer that question, and then I'd like to go back to the name
                    issue, because I think there is some interesting discussion there. In terms of
                    why me, you'd really have to ask the people that chose me because I would agree
                    that, given my rank and my situation in the Foreign Service at that time, it
                    would be surprising that I would even be considered for the position of director
                    of the Foreign Service Institute. That being said, however, for whatever reason,
                    I was interviewed, and I knew when I had the interview that I would be selected.
                    Sometimes there's just a chemistry. There's a spark. And why that is at
                    sometimes, and not at others and with some people and not others is a bit of a
                    mystery, but I knew, when the under secretary of Management of the day
                    interviewed me about the job, that at the end of that interview I would be
                    offered the job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the under secretary?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: John Rogers. Let me say something about the name, though.</p>
                <p>Q: Before we get to that, let's go back to this; then we'll go to the name. But
                    did you have somebody who was looking after you and said, “How about this guy?”
                    Because somebody had to come up with the name.</p>
                <pb facs="0103" n="Page0103"/>
                <p>TAYLOR: The answer is I don't know if that is the case, but as I understand it -
                    and again, I'm not the best-positioned person to answer the question; John
                    Rogers would be. I don't know how he got my name in the first place, but I do
                    know that, however he got it in the first place, he called a few of the
                    ambassadors that I had worked for, including the one that I was currently
                    working for at the time, Ed Ney (they told me that), and I know that they gave
                    me glowing recommendations, so I suppose that led to the interview. But what I
                    would take away from the interview and infer - but maybe wrongly because only
                    John Rogers knows the answer - is that for whatever reason, right or wrong, he
                    had lost confidence in the Foreign Service Institute, and he was searching
                    around for new ideas, new directions, and kind of out-of-the-box thinking. Now
                    those who know me in the Foreign Service, and maybe a lot didn't at the time,
                    know that that's kind of my specialty. I like that approach, and it seemed that
                    that was part of the chemistry and the connection in the interview, because when
                    we discussed, for example, the new training center, I never discussed it in
                    terms of buildings or geography or logistics; I discussed it in terms of new
                    ideas, of new approaches to training, and upgrading the role of professional
                    development in the entire system. So for me the whole notion of a new training
                    center had precious little to do with new bricks and mortar and everything to do
                    with what we could lever out of new bricks and mortar in terms of upgrading our
                    training, new ideas, and making the profession more relevant to the world we
                    were operating in. And I think that's exactly what he wanted, for whatever
                    reason, and he probably didn't get that from many of the interviews that he had.
                    But again, you've got to talk to him about it.</p>
                <p>Q: I know, I understand that, but I mean, I could have understood it more if you
                    had been kind of a Washington special assistant type and all, because these are
                    usually the guys people think about because they're around, and they're bright
                    young people and not so young people who've been running around doing errands,
                    and when the top people choose, they usually look at somebody who's essentially
                    a Washington operator or somebody who's had a couple of series of
                    ambassadorships and its his time or something like that.</p>
                <p>TAYLOR: Right, and of course I didn't fit either of those molds. But what I did
                    fit and what was perfect, I think, Stu, is that, given the fact that he and
                    perhaps some around him, for whatever reason, had lost confidence in the
                    training institution, I was almost the perfect solution to that problem, because
                    there's probably nobody in the Foreign Service, just fortuitously, who was as
                    strong an advocate and believer in the role of professional development than I
                    am and had as strong a commitment to the Foreign Service Institute and to its
                    potential for the future as I did. And now with the under secretary picking me,
                    I was his person, and we had restored the loop of confidence with the leadership
                    of the Department. And so in the final analysis, I guess on a bottom line,
                    because he made the choice and because he made it for his own set of reasons, I
                    was in an immensely stronger position than the directors that came before me
                    with respect to the under secretary of Management. We had his confidence; we had
                    his support at a critical time, when we did have to complete the building of
                    this new center, move out here, and start to use it more effectively.</p>

                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: Well, that name had been, I think, put in the legislation, and maybe
                    Steve Low would actually be a better person to explain how it developed. But I
                    think it's important. Now clearly it does not have a catchy acronym, and that's
                    a drawback. We all saw it immediately, and we tried to play with NFATC and give
                    it a variety of “infatcy,” “naftac,” but none of them - none of them - worked
                    the way FSI did or the way another acronym might. And that's a drawback because
                    you like a little zip, a little class, a little panache in the acronym so it
                    sinks and has a message, and this one didn't. But you know, if you think about
                    the literal words: Foreign, Service, Institute; and then you think about the
                    literal words: National, Foreign, Affairs, Training, Center; you can grasp very
                    quickly that the latter name, although more complicated and less catchy, is a
                    much broader and richer concept. And I thought, and I still think, that one of
                    the potentials of this new training center is to fill up the full potential of
                    that meaning. I don't think we've done it yet. I tried to, and I wasn't
                    successful enough, in my view. But I think we've moved in that direction. But
                    this should be the premier comprehensive training center for all U.S. government
                    employees going overseas and working in the foreign affairs field. And although
                    it has a different function and a different mission than, say, West Point or
                    Annapolis or the National War College or the Naval War College or the Army War
                    College, we should be able to build it to a level of such prestige and
                    excellence that it is recognized in the same way those names are recognized in
                    their professions. And a little helper along that way, if we wish to use it, is
                    that broad, all-inclusive, labeling: National Foreign Affairs Training
                    Center.</p>

                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: There certainly was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because that has a nice ring to it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: It has a very nice ring to it. It has no mission ring tit, but it has a
                    very nice ring to it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was just thinking, you have the U.S. Naval Academy, but

                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: And also, Arlington Hall, for insiders, not for people outside the
                    beltway, of course, has a long tradition because there were important government
                    activities here stemming back into the early 1940s, and so that name resonates
                    among foreign policy insiders and intelligence insiders and so forth. And I do
                    think that we ought to find a way of using both, as you pointed out in the case
                    of the Naval Academy, because of just the sweetness of the sound of Arlington
                    Hall, plus building on the strength of its history.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, in the first place, you were here from when to when?
                        TAYLOR: From '92 to '95.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Q: When you took over, you said you had some ideas, but I take it you had an
                    agenda when you came. Could you describe what your personal agenda was and also
                    what was the agenda of Rogers, or where was he pointing?</p>
                <p>TAYLOR: What he wanted was someone with new ideas, and for better or worse, I had
                    ideas that seemed new to him and maybe to some others in the system which he
                    approved and gave me the green light. And so literally the week I arrived, we
                    did set out for the senior leadership what was called “an agenda for change,”
                    and it was written down on paper. Remember in an earlier interview I told you
                    about Ed Ney saying if you couldn't write it down on one page, you don't have
                    it. And I wrote it down on one page, and I gave it out, because this place does
                    a lot of things, but I didn't want my agenda to be a description of all the
                    things we were doing. I wanted it to be a direction for the future and the way
                    we were going to set priorities and move strategically, and I could fit that on
                    one page - barely.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you give us some of it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0106" n="Page0106"/>
                <p>TAYLOR: Sure, the notion here was really basically that we wanted to energize
                    this entire institution, and that meant the State Department and the foreign
                    affairs agencies as a whole, but particularly every person at the Foreign
                    Service Institute, who actually worked there and was associated on a regular
                    basis with the institute, to think of this move as an opportunity, not just for
                    a physical relocation but for a qualitative change in our mission, in our focus,
                    and in our performance, so that the notion of a move became more than taking
                    your effects from your old office to your new office and then going into the
                    classroom and doing precisely what you had done in Rosslyn, only in nicer
                    surroundings. It was really an invitation and an encouragement to step up
                    several notches qualitatively and to engage everybody here in thinking about
                    what that meant.Now we set out four themes that I wanted people to think about
                    that were drawn from listening to the Secretary, the Deputy Secretary, the
                    President and others talk about foreign affairs, and those themes were to
                    introduce here in stronger and innovative ways a program or an approach which I
                    called in the first instance “Diplomacy for Global Competitiveness,” which in
                    essence was to recognize that in the post-Cold War world, and with a rapidly
                    globalizing economy and culture, our missions and our foreign policy had new
                    roles and new opportunities to increase American prosperity and to help create
                    high-quality jobs at home in a variety of ways, ranging from assisting
                    particular American businesses about particular projects all the way to opening
                    new markets through comprehensive free trade agreements, through intellectual
                    property protection agreements, and this sort of thing. Then the second theme
                    was to introduce in stronger and more effective ways our performance on the
                    so-called “global issues” - international environment, crime, terrorism,
                    science, and technology questions - the issues which don't respect borders. A
                    country can say, “This is my border,” and international pollution rolls right on
                    through. Now in the Cold War period those issues were present, but they were
                    clearly marginal to the core foreign policy focus of prevailing in the Cold War.
                    At the end of the Cold War, we had an effort, particularly in the State
                    Department with the introduction of an under secretary for Global Affairs, the
                    appointment of Tim Wirth, to give these issues a higher meaning in our foreign
                    policy, and I wanted training to help do that. And so that was the second
                    thing.</p>
                <p>Then the third thing was to develop a technology strategy. Technology was
                    changing so rapidly, and I thought we needed a stronger, more focused approach,
                    not just to training our people in using the new technologies, but to
                    incorporating technology in our training itself. For example, one of the themes
                    that we tried to promote was taking training to the workplace, instead of always
                    bringing workers to the training place, and concepts like just-in-time training,
                    where certain training module, instead of being taught in a summer, for people
                    who are passing through and maybe the information isn't used for two years or 18
                    months until they run into the problem, at which time they've forgotten even the
                    best training, that we would develop CD-ROMs and other forms of computer
                    assisted learning and training that could put that information on their desk the
                    morning the needed it. So you're going to hire an FSN? Well, you don't have to
                    remember what they told you about all the rules that affect that 18 months ago
                    in a course in Washington. You can just with a couple of flicks of your finger
                    have the FAM -</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0107" n="Page0107"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: FAM is the Foreign Affairs Manual.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: -and all of the regulations and any sort of advice and counsel that the
                    management of the Department has about this at the moment flash up an hour
                    before you do that, so you've got it right when you need it. Anyhow, the
                    technology, incorporating a technology strategy, both with respect to stronger
                    training in the uses of new technology but also using technology in the training
                    process, was the third theme.</p>
                <p>And then the fourth was to increasingly see our profession - the foreign affairs
                    profession - as a leadership profession, that we weren't just analysts and we
                    weren't just reporters but in this vast U.S. government bureaucracy of foreign
                    affairs agencies, increasingly present in missions and posts all over the world,
                    that the Foreign Service of the United States also had a leadership role, to
                    step out and not just be one of many, being a round peg in a round hole while
                    other people were square pegs in square holes, but actually had a role of
                    leading and managing the foreign affairs process, particularly at embassies
                    abroad. We wanted to create a new school of leadership at the NFATC.</p>
                <p>So those were the four themes, the diplomacy for global competitiveness, the
                    global issues agenda, a technology strategy, and a stronger focus on leadership
                    in the foreign affairs profession, that constituted the agenda for change when I
                    started.</p>
                <p>Q: When you arrived at the FSI and you were not really a creature of the FSI,
                    what FSI experience did you have before?</p>
                <p>TAYLOR: Well, I'd had language training at FSI. I'd had the Spanish. I'd had
                    Serbo-Croatian. I'd had Indonesian.</p>
                <p>Q: Can you describe kind of the culture you found of the FSI? When you arrived,
                    was it a different world than the one you'd been dealing with, because I would
                    think it's always difficult to get an institution of any kind to turn around,
                    particularly people who are academics. You know, they have their own way of
                    doing it and if people come in to change it they're usually chewed up and spat
                    out, but I was wondering how you found this one.</p>
                <pb facs="0108" n="Page0108"/>
                <p>TAYLOR: Well, I found a culture that I loved. I didn't find it all that foreign.
                    It was about what I expected, and it's a complex and diverse culture. In fact,
                    FSI is one of the most diverse and complex institutions in the U.S. government,
                    something that's often overlooked, in large part due to the large language
                    school, with so many female professors and teachers coming from such a variety
                    of cultural and linguistic and ethnic backgrounds. And then there are portions
                    of it that are very academic, where everybody who teaches - like in Area Studies
                    - usually has a Ph. D. and has taught at a university or maybe still is and is
                    brought here on contract just to teach a course. But the School of Professional
                    Studies is very different than that, heavily staffed by government employees and
                    focusing on government sorts of professional work. The Overseas Briefing Center,
                    totally different, wonderful group of people skilled in sort of the “soft
                    sciences” approach to relationships, families going overseas and preparing
                    oneself for successful cross-cultural adaptation. So there wasn't one culture;
                    there was a variety of cultures here. I thought they were wonderful; I still
                    think they're wonderful. I found them surprisingly responsive to change. Sure
                    there was a lot of resistance - there always is - but given the kinds of changes
                    that we're talking about and the cultural barriers to change that you refer to
                    in your question, I thought there was an awful lot of eagerness for this sort of
                    thing, particularly because we weren't imposing (and I made sure we didn't)
                    specific programs or classes or exercises from the top down. I was setting forth
                    these broad themes, but I was asking the people here to say what that would mean
                    specifically in their areas of expertise. The senior leadership of deans and
                    associate deans, the executive director and the deputy executive director were
                    management partners and colleagues and the two deputies, John Sprott and Doug
                    Larson, were superb. So we had a real team effort. And there were a lot of
                    people here, Stu, who had never been asked to do anything like that and who were
                    hungry for that.</p>
                <p>Let me tell you a little story. One of the first things I did when I was director
                    of FSI was I walked through the whole institution. It took me a whole day (it
                    was down at Rosslyn), and I tried to meet every employee. I went to the
                    warehouse. I didn't care what they were doing, whether they were janitors in the
                    warehouse, whether they were teaching in any - I didn't care. I wanted to meet
                    every employee, let them see me. I went into one of the language teachers'
                    offices and shook his hand and it was almost embarrassing. He started to cry. He
                    said he'd been working at FSI for almost 50 years, since the '40s, since it
                    started, and that no director had ever spoken to him, much less asked him what
                    he thought.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Good God!</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0109" n="Page0109"/>
                <p>TAYLOR: There was a hunger here, among many, to be involved in making these sorts
                    of decisions, and they responded, and that was a real source of energy for me
                    and, I think, of forward momentum for the institution. So change is always a
                    mixed bag and a mixed picture, but there is a bunch of great people here, and I
                    think anybody change, whether it was the one I was trying to bring about or
                    we're talking about others in the future, the key to it is empowering and
                    involving the staff here and not trying to dictate specific things from the top
                    down. People need guidance, they need direction, they need empowerment, they
                    need a framework, they need a strategy, but then let them fill it out and show
                    how to do it.</p>

                <p>TAYLOR: That's right.</p>
                <p>Q: Neither of these men I would put at the top or near the top of any list about
                    being overly interested in institutional development. I mean they're basically
                    lawyers dealing with the problems at hand. This is not to knock them; I mean,
                    they dealt with very earth-shaking things. But we all look back to George
                    Shultz. I mean, we all acknowledge the fact that this is why the Institute is
                    here, and we hope some day something will happen so there will be an
                    acknowledgment of Shultz's role. But you have two distant Secretaries of State
                    and you had John Rogers, who was, you know, you were selected by him, but what
                    happened, did you find you were continuing to get the support? How did this come
                    out?</p>
                <p>TAYLOR: Well, quite naturally. I mean it's a good question, and I think the
                    answer is the obvious one, that there was a new administration, there was a new
                    set of leadership, and we all had to find our way again. But the completion of
                    the new training center was never in question. Shultz had provided the impetus
                    and my predecessors had taken to project beyond the point of no return. We had
                    to establish new relationships, adjust to new priorities, and try to move
                    forward in that new context. For me personally, and for this institution, we did
                    not have as strong a voice and as strong a support in the new situation as we'd
                    had from Under Secretary Rogers. But that's just natural. I had been selected by
                    Under Secretary Rogers, he had endorsed the agenda for change and the new
                    strategies that I talked about, he was supporting them, and then we had a
                    brand-new administration who had nothing to do with that and so had to take a
                    look at it and had to fine-tune or, even more than that, had to adjust courses
                    based on their priorities and their sense of the directions that they wanted to
                    take.</p>
                <pb facs="0110" n="Page0110"/>
                <p>Q: I would have thought that under both these administrations your major problem
                    would be time because we were going through, particularly in the Christopher
                    period, an attitude from the President and by Congress of downsizing, fewer
                    people to do more things. And for many in the Foreign Service, training is
                    considered an indulgence, even with languages. How did you deal with that?</p>
                <p>TAYLOR: Well, first, during my tenure as director, FSI itself was not in any way
                    downsized. In fact, we continued to grow based on the notion that this new
                    training center was a wise and fine investment, not a consumption cost, and we
                    were able to use that thought, and I think it is a reality, but we were able to
                    use that at the time to continue to strengthen FSI, and it was not, even though
                    all the other bureaus at the time were pressured to downsize, we were not. Now
                    nonetheless, we exist to serve the wider system. Now in my view, we should exist
                    to serve the entire national foreign affairs community. That's the main issue
                    that we discussed already. We certainly in practical terms every day exist to
                    service the Department of State directly, and when that institution is
                    downsizing and unable to send as many people to training, then that affects us
                    in a variety of ways, and so your questions are right on target. What I can say
                    is that that issue, there was a time lag on that issue, and my successors had to
                    deal with a diminishing of the flow of employees here for training in ways that
                    I did not. Our numbers were still very high when I left. But we had foresight.
                    We could see this coming. It was in the pipeline, and so adjustments then had to
                    be made. They're better to talk about how they made them and why they made them
                    in the ways that they did, but as you know, subsequently FSI itself went through
                    a period of retrenchment because we didn't need nearly as many language
                    instructors and others for a dwindling student base as we had in earlier
                    period.</p>
                <p>Q: When you first started, what were some of the hard rocks that you had to deal
                    with?</p>
                <pb facs="0111" n="Page0111"/>
                <p>TAYLOR: There weren't many hard ones. We had a great group of people here, and no
                    matter what they may have thought about these new directions and these new
                    ideas, and clearly some of them liked them and some of them liked them less, and
                    that's fair enough - you wouldn't expect anything more - but I tried to run an
                    institute and a management that was open, that was flexible, that listened. And
                    I took on board critical comment and evaluated it, and if I thought it was
                    right, made some adjustments as a result of it. I thought that was healthy, and
                    it was certainly consistent with the notion of empowering people to step forward
                    and say, How are we going to do these things, and what makes sense where your
                    responsibilities are and where you're teaching and where you're holding classes?
                    I mean, one of the things I did regularly was hold three or four town meetings
                    every year. We held three or four a year, and it was a good way of connecting
                    with a very wide audience of employees and people here who were studying. In
                    addition to that, I tried to get around the Institute on a regular basis, to
                    staff meetings, and agreed to meet with employees individually and in groups. I
                    probably talked personally at some length over my three years with 90 percent or
                    more of the people who work here and tried to listen to their concerns and
                    explain how those concerns fit into what we were doing and many times was
                    sensitized to issues that I hadn't understood, and we were able to take, I
                    think, actions that constitute progress, if not perfect solutions. So all of
                    that was, I think, part of the approach that I took, keeping in touch with
                    employees and being open and inviting critical comment to what we were doing.
                    Now there was one cultural thing, but we solved it very quickly, and it took an
                    outsider, and it was an advantage to be an outsider in this way. I think one of
                    the reasons the under secretary had lost confidence in the institution is that
                    his office and the institution had gotten into a kind of a negative cycle of
                    self-fulfilling prophesies in which the institution felt it wasn't being
                    supported properly and, therefore, bad things were happening, and he felt that
                    the institution was constantly whining and complaining and, therefore, wasn't
                    reliable, was just a chronic complainer. And FSI prepared a briefing book for
                    me, and it included papers that it had sent to the under secretary and to others
                    on the Seventh Floor, and when I looked at that, I could see what the problem
                    was. There was one beautiful paper that FSI was very proud of. It was divided in
                    half. On the top portion of the page it had listed all the budget cuts and
                    problems and resource constraints that were bedeviling the institution, and on
                    the bottom of the page it had then listed all of the retrenchments, the lower
                    quality, the less training, the diminished effort it could give as a result of
                    what it listed on the top of the page. And the minute I looked at that, I said,
                    you know, I see the problem here immediately: we're going to have to put this
                    page in thirds. Sure, point out what the cuts are, sure point out the
                    consequences of the cuts, but then we're going to have to have a section that
                    says what we're doing about that, because we're not just going to sit here and
                    say we can't do our job because they're cutting us. We're going to have to show
                    some creativity, an ability to establish priorities and make them work, team
                    players have to roll with those punches and still get the job done the
                    Department wants. So let's add a section that says how we're managing under
                    pressure and how we're still going to get our job done. That was kind of the
                    missing link in that cycle of communication that had gone wrong between the
                    institutions and the under secretary's officAnd once we started to do that, the
                    resources all came back.</p>
                <pb facs="0112" n="Page0112"/>
                <p>And I'll tell you a story why about that, too. In the Ambassadorial Seminar we
                    had a governor, former governor, going overseas as ambassador, and one of the
                    things in the Ambassadorial Seminar, as you know, is you get all the assistant
                    secretaries coming through explaining what they do, especially the M assistant
                    secretaries, what they do to support an embassy and the Department. And every
                    one at the time, legitimately, was complaining about budget cuts and downsizing
                    and so forth, but when I gave my presentation, I gave a little bit of an
                    elaboration on the agenda for change. I didn't talk about budgets at all, and at
                    the end, this former governor raised his hand and said, “You know, the only part
                    of this institution - I'm speaking as a governor now - the only part of this
                    institution that I would give any money to is FSI, because all these other
                    people came in here and whined and complained about not having enough money, but
                    I don't have enough money. I can't do anything about that. There's only one part
                    that came in here and said it had new ideas and was going to do bold new things.
                    Now I have a limited amount of money. I think I'll invest it on new ideas and
                    bold new approaches.” And once we got that kind of cycle working with the
                    Seventh Floor, we got, as I mentioned earlier, a kind of support that allowed us
                    to sail through, for almost three years, a situation in which the rest of the
                    Department was being crunched on a downsizing but we were being well supported
                    along the lines that this was a necessary and important investment in the
                    future. I think that is what George Shultz had in mind when he insisted on the
                    importance of a new training center, investing in our most important resource -
                    our people.</p>
                <p>Q: How did you find the Foreign Service as an institution dealt with the FSI,
                    because I think of some of my colleagues who have gone on to bigger and better
                    things, and there's a tendency to look upon training as being a waste of time
                    because they want to get out there in the corridors of power and do whatever one
                    does in the corridors of power. And language is accepted, but almost
                    reluctantly, but almost anything else - I'm talking about the high achievers in
                    the Foreign Service - is felt to be not conducive to a good career. Did you find
                    yourself up against this?</p>
                <pb facs="0113" n="Page0113"/>
                <p>TAYLOR: Oh, absolutely, and I think the system is still up against it, because
                    that is a clash of cultural values that remains unresolved. Certainly the
                    traditional cultural value in the Foreign Service is really to promote the
                    high-flyer, the really brilliant, eccentric, exceptional individual who can do
                    marvelous things, and in that context, taking time out for training, is a
                    negative. It's a liability. And everyone sort of buys into that value. It is the
                    dominant and traditional value in the system. There are some of us who think
                    that the world has gotten too complicated and too important in its complications
                    for U.S. interests for a profession to rely on talented amateurs in order to
                    prevail time after time through an indefinite future, and that there is a
                    systemic need to strengthen professional development, and that includes
                    education and training, and to connect it to career advancement. So that
                    participating in the professional development system, which includes FSI, works
                    in tandem with the career advancement system, assignments and promotion, rather
                    than in opposition to it, as the dominant cultural value now sees it. We haven't
                    been able to do that. We've talked about it. I certainly talked about it a lot
                    with the Director General when I was the director of FSI. I've talked a lot
                    about it with the current Director General and with the under secretaries of
                    management. It's, I think, a work in progress, but a very slow one, and there
                    has yet not been the leadership that would strengthen that connection to the
                    point where these two parts of the system, professional development and career
                    advancement, work in tandem. And unless and until that happens, we will remain a
                    culture of talented amateur high fliers, which I have to admit, when you see the
                    individuals who are used as examples, are wonderful; but it is not prudent -
                    it's not even smart - to manage an entire system that includes thousands and
                    thousands of diverse people on the basis of what a few can do. That's crazy. And
                    that's what we're doing.</p>
                <p>Q: And of course, the issues are such that they are issues becoming more complex,
                    and you can't deal with this out of your hip pocket. Well, a couple of
                    questions. Were you able to see any change in how we dealt with our junior
                    incoming officers, called the A-100 class? Were you able to make any progress
                    there?</p>
                <p>TAYLOR: In what sense?</p>
                <p>Q: Well, to me, I don't know, you're talking about changes, but one of the things
                    that's disturbed me, and in fact, it's one of the prime reasons why we're
                    sitting here, is to build up a history of those that have gone before, but in
                    order tell the people that they have a long tradition and they're part of a long
                    tradition. The military uses this. Other groups use this. We hire elite people,
                    but we are very reluctant to say you're special, but we need special effort on
                    your part to continue to be special, but we seem to bring them in and then sort
                    of throw them to the wolves and no feeling about what they're entering.</p>
                <pb facs="0114" n="Page0114"/>
                <p>TAYLOR: Well, there is probably insufficient attention paid to that. You know, I
                    think the answer to that is no. The junior officer, the A-100 course that you're
                    referring to, had undergone a revision shortly before I became director of FSI.
                    I paid very close attention to that course. I met with that course several
                    times. I always had brown-bag lunches with the members of each course, by
                    myself, so that we could have some really candid discussion - and some of it was
                    extremely useful and candid. I still don't think we're doing that right. There's
                    a lot of potential for totally redoing that course. I think one of the problems
                    is that we've sort of accepted the basic model, and when we've made evaluations
                    and changes, we've sort of tinkered around the edges, and probably those have
                    been marginal improvement. But what we really need is perhaps a paradigm shift
                    and to go back to zero-base thinking and ask some of the questions you've
                    started to, but some others as well.</p>
                <p>Remember earlier we had mentioned the importance of connecting professional
                    development to career advancement throughout the life of a professional career.
                    That should begin at the A-100 class, and it should be powerful in the A-100
                    class. The personnel system, managed by the Director General, and the training
                    system, managed by the director of FSI, at the A-100 level should be so powerful
                    and so excellent that a person participating should think it is a seamless
                    experience - not trapped in the personnel system, not trapped at FSI, but
                    existing in a product produced by both that is a real synergy. But we haven't
                    been able to get a priority focus on that. It would take both a Director General
                    and a director of FSI who could legitimately make that one of their highest
                    priorities in order to effect a change like that. And given everything else
                    that's on their plates, it's very unlikely ever to get to that level, and that's
                    based on my experience as director. This is something I've always wanted to do.
                    The Director General of the Foreign Service at that time, as you may remember,
                    was also a rather surprising appointment to the Foreign Service, and she and I
                    were very close friends, and we worked very closely together on these issues and
                    she paid a lot of attention to the A-100 course. So in terms of the disposition
                    at the top of the two institutions, it couldn't have been better, and yet
                    neither of us legitimately could have made that such a high priority. But you
                    are right, the A-100 course should be a benchmark of professional
                    excellence.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're talking about Genta Hawkins.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: Yes, Genta Hawkins Holmes.</p>
                <pb facs="0115" n="Page0115"/>
                <p>Q: One of the things - and I can speak without having any examples in mind
                    because I don't know - but if you're looking at an institution, I mean, we are
                    what we ingest. In other words, we are what we recruit and what at the officer
                    corps come into the A-100 course. This would seem to be the place where for two
                    years you could get the premier mid-grade officers - maybe they would come out
                    of a dangerous post - but inspiring officers, who would run the A-100 course...
                    I mean, this should be a place to really grab a mid-grade officer who'd say, “My
                    God, I'm going to get in and they're going to be my boys or my boys and girls.”
                    But I don't have the feeling of that. The A-100 course director sounds like a
                    routine assignment.</p>
                <p>TAYLOR: No, I don't think it is a routine assignment, but it isn't what you've
                    said, either, although there have been some examples like that. For example, the
                    current Director General was in charge of the A-100 course, and he did it at the
                    time, many years ago, precisely for the reasons that you've just described, so
                    it does happen. Now although the A-100 experience does not get to the top of
                    either the Director General or the Director of FSI's agenda, it is not off the
                    radar screen, and I can tell you that both systems, the personnel system and the
                    training system, pay a great deal of attention to who is assigned to those jobs.
                    And what we have tried to do, because in general we have not gotten the type of
                    person that you have described (and that would be the perfect sort of solution
                    if we could institutionalize that, not necessarily by regulation but simply by
                    values, that those sorts of people begged and fought to get that job), what we
                    have been able to do and always have been able to do - I think always have been
                    able to do - has been to have very excellent officers who are committed to the
                    A-100 process, to the junior officers, and to making that experience as strong
                    and as positive as possible. They are very caring officers. You know, I was just
                    the mentor for this last A-100 class; it was kind of a unique thing for a
                    retired officer to do that. But it was, again, a wonderful experience, and
                    something I felt very natural having been out here as director and been
                    association with all the A-100 classes for three years. And one of the things
                    that I mentioned in my first day is that in their entire life in the Foreign
                    Service, for some of them it will be 30 or 35 or more years, they will never
                    again be in a situation that is so caring about them than the one they are about
                    to enter, and that is a tribute, in large part, to the people who staff that
                    orientation division and who lead and manage the A-100 process.</p>
                <p>But you know, we've got to find a way, I think, to get to he point that you
                    described earlier. That would be the perfect situation. It may be that we need
                    to think about establishing some incentives.</p>
                <p>Q: It just occurred to me that you might have something the equivalent to, you
                    have to apply for this specially, and before a committee of distinguished
                    people, and this is an imprimatur that, by God, we think it's important, you've
                    got it, and so you're tapped for bigger and better things if you do a good
                    job.</p>
                <p>TAYLOR: I needed you to be on the staff when I was director. If you'd ever talked
                    to me that way in a staff meeting, we would have done that.</p>
                <pb facs="0116" n="Page0116"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you think about it, it makes perfect sense.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: Makes wonderful sense. It's just, you know...</p>
                <p>Q: What about training people to be political officers? Consular training I think
                    - I come from the consular ranks - I think they're doing a very solid job on
                    this. They sort of started the innovation of the things, but what's your
                    impression of this?</p>
                <p>TAYLOR: Well, let's take a step back. We've talked about some of the deficiencies
                    of training: the lack of connectivity between professional development and
                    career development, career advancement. Where is Foreign Service training really
                    good? And it is, so let's talk about some of those things. It is good at
                    preparation for your next job, by and large. If you're going to be a budget and
                    fiscal officer in Mexico City, we will give you Spanish, darned good Spanish
                    training, we will give you darned good budget and fiscal training, we will give
                    you darned good training on computers and the systems that you need to be a
                    budget and fiscal officer, and we'll give you darned good area studies and
                    cultural training, all designed to make you more effective in your next job. And
                    by and large, next job training in this system is extraordinarily good, and it's
                    not that we don't need to constantly improve it - we do - but it operates at a
                    very, very high level already.</p>
                <pb facs="0117" n="Page0117"/>
                <p>One of the reasons for some disparity, relative disparity, though, among
                    functions or specialties - you mentioned consular training as very good - is
                    because there are certain senior people in the Department who manage bureaus who
                    care a lot about training their people. Now Mary Ryan in the Consular Bureau is
                    one of those. Pat Kennedy in the Admin side is another, and an awful lot of the
                    training that happens here is because they're out here on a regular basis. You
                    don't see many assistant secretaries out here on a regular basis, but you see
                    those two, and they are thinking and always working with the director of FSI and
                    the leadership of FSI to upgrade the training for those professionals and to
                    keep that on the cutting edge. And that's why, in the consular and admin areas,
                    the training evolves in such a creative and timely way. You don't have a
                    corresponding kind of godfather figure for training on the political and
                    economic side, and so you get spurts here, either as the system recognizes that
                    there are such changes that we simply have to accommodate it in the political
                    system, or you get personalities like the ones I've mentioned but who are only
                    around for a short time who innovate and create themselves and then leave a
                    legacy as they move on. But there is not an institutionalized interest and
                    connection in the political and economic training to the same degree that there
                    is on the consular and admin side. Now one of the suggestions I had while I was
                    director, another one of the many things that I did not get done right - but I
                    still think it's a good idea - was to create what I, just to make an effect,
                    called a “school board,” and you can put it in quotes, to establish a
                    distinguished group that would include the Seventh Floor and some of the Sixth
                    Floor leadership of the Department but also others who were interested - deans
                    or presidents of Georgetown and G.W. and American and Howard and things like
                    this, and Hopkins, and also some from across the country, if they were
                    interested - who could give guidance to the curriculum of the Foreign Service
                    Institute, because the way things are right now, there is not institutionalized
                    way of setting priorities. Remember the agenda for change that we talked about?
                    Well, those are my ideas, based on listening to the Secretary and others talk
                    about foreign policy priorities, but there is no other system, or we could have
                    had no ideas and run on inertia, because there is no system that is there,
                    professionally institutionalized, to on a regular basis assess the relevance and
                    strength of the curriculum and give guidance for new directions. It's all very
                    personalized at the moment. And I thought some sort of board like that,
                    prestigious board, could both perform that function but also add a little luster
                    to the institutions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A Board of Visitors, the Naval Academy has it and other
                        placehave it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: Exactly.</p>
                <pb facs="0118" n="Page0118"/>
                <p>Q: Absolutely appropriate. What about in language training? I was just
                    interviewing Dick Jackson this morning, and he mentioned that he always wanted
                    Japanese language training and he took Japanese for two years at the age of 43,
                    and he said, you know, Personnel shouldn't have done it. He'd just learned Thai,
                    but was assigned to two years in Okinawa, but felt he was just too old to really
                    move ahead in Japanese, and then he was assigned to Thailand again right after.
                    There doesn't seem to be much of a connect between age, language ability - I
                    mean, there really is something to how old you are what language you can learn
                    and to have, let's say, the linguistic input into Personnel.</p>
                <p>TAYLOR: Well, the issue you're raising has so many interesting dimensions. First
                    of all, of course Personnel shouldn't have permitted that assignment, much less
                    made it, which is what they did. FSI shouldn't have allowed Personnel to make
                    it, either. This is one of the important arguments why FSI should be independent
                    from the personnel system and not a part of the personnel system. There needs to
                    be a healthy tension between the director of FSI and the Director General, in
                    which the training director has the power to say no to a Director General. And
                    these are the kinds of things that it's worth looking at and perhaps saying no
                    to under certain circumstances. So that's one thing.</p>
                <p>A second thing is that we're back to the era of talented amateurism again. When I
                    arrived at FSI, somebody came and saw me and said how wonderful FSI was, that
                    they had learned six languages there and they rattled them off. And my response
                    was - I'll paraphrase it because I can't remember it exactly - that's a great
                    tribute to yourself, but it's a damning indictment of our personnel and training
                    system. We don't have time to train you in six languages, a big waste. So we're
                    back also to the lack of connection between professional development and
                    sensible career development and career advancement. On the one hand, some people
                    can skyrocket to the top, or try to, at least, and never get any training at
                    all, and other people can wallow around and spend half of their life in training
                    that isn't productively used. I mean, this is an indictment of that lack of
                    connection and perspective between the professional development and the career
                    advancement systems.</p>
                <p>Now beyond that, it also raises other interesting issues, one of which is,
                    shouldn't we be recruiting at the entry level people who are skilled in at least
                    certain hard languages. It's true that somebody who is 43 or older may have a
                    hard time learning Japanese or Arabic or Korean or Chinese - these very, very
                    difficult languages. It's also true that somebody who's 25 is going to have a
                    hard time learning them. It's already too late, in the sense of the skills we
                    really want for most people. Again, there can be exceptions, but for most people
                    it's already too late. And why this profession should assume that we can just
                    train anybody whose assigned into one of these super-hard languages to be
                    fluent, whether they're 25 or 43, needs to be examined as well. We do need
                    fluent speakers, looking ahead, in Japanese, in Chinese, in Arabic, in Russian,
                    and maybe the professional thing to do is to take account of those who are
                    already fluent when they're applying for entry, and not to assume that's an
                    irrelevancy. So that's another question that you've opened up.</p>
                <pb facs="0119" n="Page0119"/>
                <p>And then finally, there is the issue of the training itself, which was something
                    that we did try to directly affect during my time at FSI. You know, a lot of our
                    language training, if you look at it closely, appears to be training directed at
                    the FSO political officer. The FSO political officer, though, is about 18
                    percent of the people who go to language classes. Why the whole curriculum and
                    whole course should be geared to that level, that niche, was a bit of mystery,
                    and so one of the innovations that we tried - and I don't know if we got
                    critical mass on this or not, but it looked like we might, but maybe it's not
                    around any more - was to develop on a pilot basis, to see if it would work, a
                    new approach to the language learning, in which, for the first 12 weeks, all new
                    students would be together, building the grammatical linguistic base. And then
                    we developed specialty tracks, so that there was a political track, there was an
                    economic track, there was a public diplomacy track, there was a secretarial (now
                    office management specialist) track, there was a security and law-enforcement
                    track, there was an administrative track, there was a consular track - so that
                    after that time people would have several weeks, about eight weeks, in which
                    they were progressing in the language but they were using vocabulary and
                    situations that they would actually find in their workplace, not the political
                    officer's workplace, as the current curriculum sort of appeared.</p>
                <p>So there's a lot of things that we can do on that. And then we tried to build in
                    more overseas study at a certain point. Again, I'm not a specialist in this
                    area, but I certainly tried to talk to all the ones I knew, and I tried to
                    observe with an objective mind. I don't know how much fluency one can really
                    build when the study is all in a classroom. It seems to me - and I heard a lot
                    of advice - that it's a lot better if at some point you get thrown into an
                    environment where that's it, and so we pioneered some overseas study, in
                    Hungarian and in others, which I thought the results were dramatically positive.
                    So your question opens up just a Pandora's box of potential to approach language
                    needs in ways different than, kind of, the admittedly excellent language
                    training that we have traditionally offered here at the Foreign Service
                    Institute. We need to try new approaches, show greater flexibility, and open up
                    to competition. All that would make us stronger.</p>
                <p>Q: Well, did you find that, particularly the language training overseas - this
                    always made a great deal of sense - put somebody with a family in Budapest or
                    something like that - I mean, we used to do that back in the '20s in Russia-</p>
                <p>TAYLOR: Right.</p>
                <p>Q: -and Estonia and Latvia, but a lot of the problem was Congress and with Jesse
                    Helms and the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee and all that, did you
                    find that you had problems with Congress on trying to move anywhere?</p>
                <pb facs="0120" n="Page0120"/>
                <p>TAYLOR: I'll tell you the truth, Stu, and it's a bitter truth. Congress was
                    always very supportive in my experience, and it was always more difficult to
                    deal with the Administration. Now that was because the Administration has a
                    responsibility to prioritize among a vast galaxy of competing needs, all of
                    which are important and all of which are nice. And so your need or my need in
                    that galaxy may be way down in the middle. And that's understandable. But these
                    ideas that were able to emerge out of the Administration's kind of pipeline
                    always were received favorably at Congress. Now we paid a lot of attention here,
                    especially in the building of the new facility, to Congressional attitudes. I
                    brought out the Congressmen from the district, and we gave them tours and had
                    briefings. When we were done and up and running here we invited staffers and
                    Congressmen more broadly interested in foreign affairs out here. Among those who
                    know about the facility and the ideas and strategies that we were pursuing, we
                    had near universal support, and that included from Senator Helms's office.</p>
                <p>Q: Back to the language, and you were talking about recruiting from people who
                    spoke a hard language, you know, initially - well, not initially, but when I
                    came in, in 1955, and a little before that, but certainly since - part of the
                    philosophy was that most Americans don't take languages in universities and
                    you're going to end up with a bunch of East Coast elitists if you have this, and
                    to get a real touch of mainstream America - when I came in it was called
                    mainstream America - you can't have this language requirement. The other one was
                    a security consideration, that if you had somebody who spoke fluent Korean,
                    they're going to be Korean, and -</p>
                <p>TAYLOR: Well, if they're Korean, they can't come in the United States Foreign
                    Service. If you mean they're Korean-American, then they're Americans.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, Korean-American, but the problem is -</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: Sounds like antiquated thinking to me.</p>
                <p>Q: Well, a Korean-American, having been consul general in Korea, there was a
                    problem of putting a Korean in a first tour there. The Koreans would be all over
                    that person to get visas and all this, and it's unfair. But I mean, there is
                    this part of the thing: one, it would be too elitist, or two, it would be too
                    ethnic-based, and in talking to the Director General, did this come up?</p>
                <p>TAYLOR: The elitist concern is still there, but I think that does not fit the
                    reality of America today. It probably did in the '40s and '50s.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In my day it did.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0121" n="Page0121"/>
                <p>TAYLOR: I think it probably did. But if you look now at the broad spectrum of
                    Americans who travel abroad, in the Peace Corps, and live abroad, they aren't
                    elitists from the East Coast universities; they're a broadly diversified base of
                    American society. So I don't think that concern is applicable today. The second
                    concern sounds, again, a little bit antiquated to me. An American citizen is an
                    American citizen, period, and I hope the personnel system would be wise enough
                    not to put a Korean American in that position on the first tour, but later on,
                    no problem at all being the political officer, economic, the ambassador - it'll
                    work wonderfully. So again, that second concern seems to me to be slightly
                    misplaced today and something that's easily manageable by a sensible personnel
                    system.</p>
                <p>Q: What about diversity? Did this cause problems for you ever? We're really
                    talking about, well, I suppose by the time you take over, the male-female thing
                    was pretty much in balance.</p>
                <p>TAYLOR: Yes it was. In the incoming classes there was already quita balance on
                    the male-female thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But we're really talking about African-Americans and
                        theiassimilation into this.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: And Hispanics, people of color generally, that's right, yes. Well, that
                    was while I was director, and my sense is, it still is, kind of a flavor of the
                    month in the system, and we haven't resolved it. The class that I'm the mentor
                    to had 50 officers in it right now, and there are two African-Americans in it,
                    so we're clearly not meeting our own recruiting rolls. Now I'll just
                    parenthetically say that last fall I was asked by the inspector general to do an
                    inspection of the Director General's office and our personnel system, which I
                    did. And we did an unusual inspection. That's why she asked me - because I like
                    to do unusual things. We benefit from taking a fresh approach to our
                    assessments. We didn't so it by organization; we did it by core mission. We
                    asked ourselves why does the personnel system exist, not how is it organized,
                    and then said, “How are we doing in fulfilling those core mission?” and backed
                    into the organization as we answered that question. Are we organized to do that?
                    And are we successful? We looked at recruitment and particularly the diversity
                    issue as part of that examination of core missions, and we made quite a
                    controversial recommendation in that report, because right now we are allocating
                    our entire recruiting effort and our recruiting budget in trying -
                    unsuccessfully, I might add - to up the number of people of color in entry
                    classes, in A-100 classes. And I think, you know, we're going to have to take a
                    different approach if we're going to be successful in meeting those goals. Now
                    if someone wants to change the goals, then maybe we don't have to take a
                    different approach, but we've had enough evidence now - it goes back over a
                    decade - of trying to say that is one of our primary objectives, targeting a
                    huge amount of resources after that objective, and in failing to meet it. Now
                    something's got to give. Either that's not the right objective or we're not
                    doing it right, and so I think the time's come where the system has to rethink
                    that because we're just chasing our tail around on that at the moment.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the Senior Seminar? Was this under
                        scrutiny?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: It sure was when I took over.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You can explain what the Senior Seminar is as of
                        today.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: Well, it's the seniormost training program at the Foreign Service
                    Institute and perhaps, arguably, in the entire U.S. government for the foreign
                    affairs community. It's a seminar that has about - I don't even remember any
                    more - 25, 30 people in it, max. About four or five or six U.S. government
                    agencies are represented in it. It's not just a State Department seminar. And it
                    is targeted at the level of people who are going to go on to be the most senior
                    managers in the system. It was meant to a high-fliers last big training jolt
                    before they achieved their maximum potential in the system. It's a wonderful
                    program. It's a 10-month program, and it's an effort to connect - reconnect in
                    some cases - these people to what's going on in America and to understand that
                    American foreign policy is intimately connected to Main Street and to our farms
                    and to our inner cities. And it's, I think, one of the best things that we do.
                    I'm only sorry that more people don't have a chance to take it. Now in the time
                    I became director of the Foreign Service Institute, that particular program was
                    under critical questioning. It seemed to take some very senior people out of the
                    system for a long time in a period where we were downsizing, and the Seventh
                    Floor of the Department, particularly the under secretary of Management, was
                    quite critically questioning as to whether this was a sensible thing to do. In
                    fact, I do remember one time in which it appeared that I might be being
                    encouraged to end the Senior Seminar as we know it and replying that I knew the
                    under secretary, from listening to him for over a year now, was critical that
                    our training didn't focus more on leadership, wasn't interagency enough, and
                    seemed unconnected to Main Street, and yet he was suggesting that I dismantle
                    the only program we had that did all three. I understand that after I left here
                    it was put under a magnifying glass again. Fortunately, I find it's still
                    intact. I think it's a wonderful program. Now it does suffer, as all of our
                    programs do, from the reality that, no matter what we say in words and theory,
                    we don't have a professional development system that is adequately connected to
                    career advancement, assignment, and promotion. The senior seminar would be far
                    better and far stronger if the people who were selected for it were as a part of
                    that selection process, naturally in some way promoted and assigned to our top
                    jobs. Right now that connection doesn't exist the way, for example, it does
                    exist in the military. When you're selected for certain training, that is the
                    absolute prerequisite to moving into the top jobs, and you treat the training
                    selection as a sure indicator that you're getting a great job or a promotion
                    afterwards. Here there is this total chasm between the two.</p>
                <pb facs="0123" n="Page0123"/>
                <p>Q: Back in '75, when I came out of the senior seminar, we're more or less told,
                    well, I hope you guys can find a job in the State Department. I mean, “Good
                    luck!” you know. It was very obvious. Also the thing, again, my experience goes
                    back 20 years, but the military really weren't sending their top people up
                    there. I mean, these are going to the War College, because it was part of the
                    department, so we were getting very nice colonels and captains but who probably
                    were going to remain colonels and captains.</p>
                <p>TAYLOR: That had changed by the time, I think, I was director, although that's
                    something that has to be reviewed every year. The military can be convinced to
                    do a lot of things, but you do have to stay in touch with what they're doing and
                    then talk to them about how to do better if you feel there's a deficiency. The
                    Senior Seminar should be for military officers who've already had the War
                    College. It should not be an alternative to the War College. And if we're
                    talking to the military, I'm sure we can convince them of that, but if we're not
                    talking to them, they might make the mistake of thinking that it's an
                    alternative, in which case it would suffer from the problem that you've just
                    mentioned.</p>
                <p>Q: What about technology? I mean, we're talking in an era now where if we go back
                    10 years computers were in their infancy, and now obviously we're just at the
                    birth of an exploding thing, and God knows what will happen in the next decade
                    even. But how did you find technology? You say part of your emphasis was on
                    using technology.</p>
                <p>TAYLOR: Right, training people in the use of our technology better, but also
                    using technology better in our training process - those were the two things that
                    we wanted to do. Part of it is connecting the dots. We did have momentary
                    flashes of leadership in the Department where people would decide that new
                    hardware and new software had to be purchased, and I was the “people-ware” guy,
                    because every time somebody got up and said we're going to buy this and we're
                    going to buy that, I would stand up and say, well, let's make sure that we have
                    a budget component in there and a personnel float in there to allow us to train
                    our people on this software and hardware; otherwise, it's going to sit in a
                    closet or in a corner and not be used. So I was the “live ware” guy. I'd always
                    say, yes, hardware and software is great but it doesn't work without the live
                    ware. I saw an example of this when I came to FSI. It was a micro-example. Down
                    in Rosslyn- (end of tape)</p>
                <pb facs="0124" n="Page0124"/>
                <p>I stumbled onto this wonderful computer assisted learning program in French. It
                    was magnificent, and they sat me down and explained it, and I watched it, and it
                    just had a power of gravitation: you wanted to use this system, it was so much
                    fun to learn using this system. So I said, “But, you know, why is it back here?
                    Why isn't it in the French language classrooms?” Well, that's an interesting
                    question. There were two or three people who knew how to use it, and it was back
                    there, but it wasn't in use to teach French. Well, in the end the answer was
                    that our French teachers are afraid of it. They aren't computer literate; they
                    see it as a threat to themselves; and they also think they'll be embarrassed in
                    front of the students by not knowing. What isthe answer to that? It's not to
                    keep it back in the corner; it's to train the teachers, it's to orient them on
                    this. And eventually we did. The person who wrote it, who developed the program,
                    was at MIT. We brought her down here for a week and took all of our French
                    teachers, and for five straight days it was explained - the reasoning behind the
                    program, how to work it, what it could do, and so forth. But there's a lot of
                    challenges in introducing technology. It isn't just the manipulation of
                    equipment. It is attitudes; it is fears; it is misunderstandings. All of that
                    has to be addressed in some strategic way to get it done right.</p>
                <p>We had another idea which I'm sure still hasn't been implemented because there
                    was very fierce resistance to this, but I didn't see why, and that is “just in
                    time” training and “real time” links between FSI and our people on the job, here
                    and overseas. In Area Studies, for example, we couldn't have a component in
                    which people could interact directly between FSI and the post. They didn't have
                    to come back here in the classroom. The instructor and people could type e-mails
                    to each other, and we could even, in some big posts, hook up interactive video
                    conferencing, and that way the Area Studies could be more than a series of
                    important lectures. We could still do that here. It could deal with real
                    questions of the moment, and whether there was any counsel or advice or insight
                    through a knowledge of the history and culture and political systems that might
                    be immediately relevant or currently relevant. But I think most of the Area
                    Studies instructors like to give lectures in classrooms and did not think they
                    should be on-line, interactive in dealing with real people at post. Still, I
                    think maybe in the future we might move in that direction. Probably some have
                    already. The e-mail system just lends itself to that if they have any sort of
                    personal relationship, you know, between the teacher and the officer at post.
                    But it's a good example about how a technology strategy is a lot more than
                    hardware and software.</p>
                <p>Q: Well, now, did you find a problem, particularly when you get away from, you
                    might say, the language teaching and into area studies and all, between the
                    academics and, for want of a better word, the professionals in the field?</p>
                <pb facs="0125" n="Page0125"/>
                <p>TAYLOR: I didn't see an unsurmountable problem with ideas like “just in time”
                    training and “taking training to the workplace” through technology and real time
                    connectivity were new and to system needs to understand them. But we still may
                    be behind the curve on them when we should be on the cutting edge in designing
                    and delivering this type of training. They're certainly very different
                    approaches, and I think a management challenge. And I thought the people who
                    were managing Area Studies at the time were excellent, but it's a chronic
                    cultural issue that has to be managed sensibly. It can't be eliminated. You find
                    ways to move forward and make it work for you because there are strengths in
                    both approaches. And it isn't one or the other; it's how to use the right one at
                    the right time and make them work together when you can. And sure, the
                    professionals are more interested in practical things and in current events and
                    so forth, and the academics are kind of more interested in textbook things and
                    lectures and not so much questions and dealing with practical situations and
                    trying to explain them in ways that might be actionable rather than... You know,
                    the academics want it to be understandable, whereas the Foreign Service officers
                    are kind of interested in its being actionable: “What am I going to do about
                    that? Can I do anything about that?”</p>
                <p>But I thought Area Studies, though a small unit, was a strong unit, and I think
                    it had terrific potentiaI mean, I would have handled it differently than it was
                    subsequently handled. I don't think we have maximized the utility of Area
                    Studies at this point. We also have in Area Studies, our gaming and simulation
                    program, which I thought was magnificent and which I saved. As director I was
                    instructed to end those people and to terminate their employment, and I didn't.
                    I moved them from where they were into Area Studies in order to save them
                    because I thought their function was potentially so valuable to the system. And
                    yet they're still just a small, little shop, and we're not using their... I
                    mean, they do wonderful things, but they could be doing so much more. So there's
                    a lot of potential in Area Studies. One thing that did bother me, but I think we
                    got it right in the end, although you never know whether it reached critical
                    mass or slipped back after I left. I did have some Area Studies instructors come
                    to see me early on and sort of say, well, we hope you don't mind, but we sort of
                    specialize in explaining to the students going overseas why American policy
                    isn't very popular in the country they're going to. You know, I said, “I don't
                    mind that at all. That sounds like a sensible thing to do, but I'd like you to
                    take it one step further. After you've explained why it isn't popular, you help
                    them understand how they can use a knowledge of the language and culture in the
                    country they're going to to make a more persuasive case, because we're not here
                    just to understand why they don't like us; we're here to shape and influence
                    that disposition and try to move it more in our direction, and there must be
                    some utility in using the language, using cultural symbols and myths, tapping
                    certain traditions, in making a more convincing case for American policy.” Well,
                    they were astounded by that notion, but I hope that they continued to do that
                    because it seemed to me to be the right follow-on to the point.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you were talking about gaming. The military uses
                        gaming to a fare-thee-well, and if nothing else, they've got the game
                        “Diplomacy,” which is a classic. But I would think that gaming had reached
                        its time by this point.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: Well, it has in most places, but not in our system, and we have such
                    high-quality - it's small but it's very high-quality - people in our Gaming and
                    Simulation Unit, and it lends itself to thinking ahead, to contingency planning.
                    More than that, in this post-Cold War world that we're living in, there are more
                    and more situations such as in Bosnia or in Africa that we've seen recently in
                    which it is an interagency response that is required, and people skilled in
                    foreign policy, military people, disaster relief people, foreign affairs
                    specialists of all kinds have to be pulled together in order to deal with the
                    situations. It's not just a question of sending in the Marines or sending in the
                    diplomats. You're going to send in both, and they're going to do things
                    differently than they've done in the past in order to deal with this situation.
                    That cries out for using gaming and simulation to build these interagency teams
                    and an awareness in all agencies of the strengths of each other and how you can
                    work together in these situations. And I think the military, which has developed
                    the art of gaming to a fare-thee-well, as you have pointed out, would really
                    welcome a much broader and stronger participation by the State Department in
                    these situations, because whether you're talking about evacuations or POLADs in
                    Bosnia and so forth, most of the military recognize that these gray, ambiguous
                    situations, where force is there but it's not used, is not the primary implement
                    of America's will, are situations that cry out for State Department and
                    political leadership. But if we're not in the process of recognizing that and of
                    building communication awareness and these teams, through the gaming process, I
                    think we lose a real opportunity. So I think there's a whole world to be
                    conquered here through the State Department's increasing, strengthening its
                    connection with the military, with our military, looking at these sorts of
                    ambiguous situations, political conflict situations in which we're engaged, and
                    using the gaming process as the way of doing that, of the connection. But only
                    time will tell if that's a good idea or not, I think it is.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, there does seem to be a major problem, and what
                        we're talking about is that here we are, part of one of the world's oldest
                        activities, diplomacy, and yet there doesn't seem to be, within the
                        corporate body of the State Department, a sense of professionalism. In other
                        words, you know, for example, I have never seen in my 30 years in the
                        Foreign Service, a reading list of books, these books you really should know
                        and maybe have dialogues on them or something like this. I mean, it goes on
                        and on and on.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0127" n="Page0127"/>
                <p>TAYLOR: Yes, I agree with that, and the time to start it is in the A-100 class,
                    as you inferred earlier, but it is a real lack in the profession. Not only don't
                    we have those reading lists, but we don't have an awareness. We don't have a
                    corporate history. We don't have a professional tradition. We reinvent the wheel
                    constantly. We don't know about ambassadorial styles and approaches based on a
                    professional assessment of our history. Every military officer is well schooled
                    in military history and in the philosophy and thinking of military strategy and
                    operations and tactics, because they can't advance in their professions without
                    having them. We don't ask that; we don't provide it; and we don't have it,
                    period.</p>
                <p>Now there was one idea I did have. It should just be part of a system, but begins
                    in the A-100 class, so I recognize that it's out of context and sitting there
                    like a dangling participle. When I was director of FSI, I did get to go to the
                    Aspen Institute Seminar out in Aspen, Colorado. It was terrific experience, but
                    one thing I took away from there is that we should have a two-week seminar like
                    that for Foreign Service officers that focuses on the readings and traditions
                    and legacies of diplomacy and wrestle with those around the... Everybody should
                    not only read them but they should be critically challenged and wrestle with
                    them and in some active way deal with an awareness of that past and what it
                    means, moving forward. I still think that would be a good idea, but it would be
                    a better idea in the context of a system that was institutionalized and that
                    began with the A-100 class.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're just within the first decade of this program, this
                        oral history program, but we're building up something which, I hope can be -
                        it has to be - used somehow to professionalize our Service. I was thinking
                        at some point that each new officer might pick one of these oral histories
                        and go through it and analyze it and talk about what was done what wasn't
                        done and question methods and policy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: That's an interesting idea.</p>
                <p>Q: You know, it's there, or you could do it by country or something like that.
                    This is part of our agenda, but it really hasn't started yet. Well, probably
                    this might be a good place to stop.</p>
                <pb facs="0128" n="Page0128"/>
                <p>TAYLOR: Well, let me just end FSI, and then maybe we'll save Estonia for another
                    time, or we could do it now. But let me just say one more thing about FSI,
                    because, again, if we see this new training center as having the potential for
                    qualitative investment in our profession - we're hoping to professionalize the
                    people but also to step them up several notches in terms of their performance,
                    not just in individual jobs but over a career. Then there was another innovation
                    that we tried that I think is still hanging around the edges and might be worth
                    pursuing, and that is to allow, by legislation, and then to wisely use in
                    practice this institution to train, under certain circumstances, people from the
                    private sector. Now let me give you just one example. There could be many, and
                    it's not all a slam-dunk one way or another. You have to use critical judgment
                    about when this is appropriate and when it isn't. But take the Overseas Briefing
                    Center, which is several floors below us, where we're sitting right now. It's a
                    wonderful group of people providing a wonderful service. Their product is
                    information, awareness, sensitivity, and assistance to families moving in
                    cross-cultural situations so the spouses and children and the family unit can be
                    successful in that transition and stay together and grow and prosper and have
                    opportunities, and not suffer from culture shock and a sense of alienation and
                    sort of diminish themselves and their opportunities, a very important need. If
                    you go down to that center, it operates today the way it did when I came into
                    the Foreign Service. There are big file cabinets with a lot of papers in folders
                    that are appropriately organized and labeled, many of which are totally out of
                    date and some of which are more current.</p>
                <p>Now when I became director, I approached several companies, technology companies,
                    the biggest and best ones in the country, because the need to adapt to
                    cross-cultural transition is as real in the private sector as it is in the
                    Foreign Service. And their families were facing the same challenges, and they
                    don't have a professional system like this, and I put on the table for them a
                    deal. I said, we will train your families. We will share our information and our
                    training courses about cross-cultural transition and adaptation with your
                    families, and in return, you technologize the Overseas Briefing Center. We've
                    got all these papers in folders in file cabinets. You put in modern hardware and
                    software and training for our OBC staff so that this stuff, we can draw on a
                    variety of information and not just those papers, and so we can be linked
                    real-time, where the links exist, to the posts, the cities where these people
                    are going, so instead of going down there now and reading a report that was
                    written a year and a half ago about what the international school is like in
                    Estonia, we can be connected right now, real-time, to the embassy and to the
                    school in Estonia and you can ask questions and get real-time answers back. Now
                    these companies were eager to do that, because we asked for very little - that's
                    a very small thing - they wouldn't even know they'd missed the systems, and we
                    were giving them something they desperately needed and had no idea how to get.
                    But we didn't get the approval to go ahead and do that. Now that's the kind of
                    thing that we should still do and that we should still pursue. It's there to be
                    done, and it's always the right time to do the right thing, and we should still
                    be pursuing it.</p>
                <pb facs="0129" n="Page0129"/>
                <p>Q: Well, I have my own personal dream, and that is to have the equivalent to a
                    Rhodes Scholarship for diplomats of other countries, who would come here,
                    because I've been involved in Kyrgyzstan and in the Federated States of
                    Micronesia and others, but the idea of maybe for three months bringing top
                    fliers from other places, maybe of the sort of upper junior kind, so we're
                    singing out of the same hymn book.</p>
                <p>TAYLOR: Stu, we're still here. When I became director, Deputy Secretary
                    Eagleburger and Under Secretary Rogers had a few months previously traveled to
                    Bulgaria and Albania and had given a commitment to the presidents of those
                    countries that the United States government would train their fledgling
                    diplomatic services, their fledgling democratic diplomatic services, in order to
                    get them started. Now we had no capacity to do that, but the commitment was on
                    the table. Now what had happened was that Under Secretary Rogers was scrambling
                    for a way now to fulfill his and Larry Eagleburger's commitment, and we did that
                    here in my first year. We brought these young diplomats from Bulgaria and
                    Albania and trained them at the Foreign Service Institute, not in classes that
                    we were already giving to Americans, but we created a whole new curriculum for
                    people in their situation. Now it was, in my view, a terrific success, and one
                    that we should have built on because here was the opportunity to train, here in
                    the United States, and that meant to know personally at a very young age the
                    entire diplomatic services of these newly emerging democracies and to forge an
                    orientation and awareness and personal relationships that then would last a
                    lifetime.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: 30 years.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: 30 years, so that when we're negotiating about nuclear weapons or trade
                    agreements or the international environment 20 years from now, we're looking
                    across the table at somebody we used to drink beer with in Rosslyn. This is an
                    enormous advantage, but we threw it away. Again, this is one of these things
                    that's not to late to do it. It's never too late to do the right thing. We ought
                    to be back in this business.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, we'll put this on paper some day. Is there anything
                        elsabout the FSI?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: Jeez, we've covered so much of it, I think that's got a good flavor.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, so we're at 1995. Larry, whither?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: Off to Estonia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did that appointment come about?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0130" n="Page0130"/>
                <p>TAYLOR: Well, I had expected to go out as ambassador to another country at the
                    time, but then again, I may not be the best person to explain all these ins and
                    outs because I wasn't the prime mover or the key decision maker, but in any
                    case, there was a reshuffling of several ambassadorships. I was not the
                    immediate cause, but I was one of the domino effects, and I landed in Estonia.
                    The person who had been scheduled to go to Estonia [decided to stay where he
                    was], so that job had come open.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So just to get this, you were in Estonia from '95 to-</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: '97.</p>
                <p>Q: I would have thought that particularly the Baltic countries, because there are
                    a good number of Baltic people whose family came from there, this would be one
                    of those domains like Ireland your name has to be Kennedy or O'Brien to get it.
                    Was this a consideration or was this part of the political process? Did you sort
                    of fall through the cracks?</p>
                <p>TAYLOR: No, you know it may turn out that the Baltic States become that in the
                    future, but they're certainly not that now, and the Estonian-American community
                    at least, and I don't want to speak for Latvian- or Lithuanian-Americans, but
                    the Estonian-American community very much wants a professional, a career officer
                    in Estonia because they know that the freedom of Estonia is a fragile thing.
                    It's not something to be taken for granted, and the job of building and shaping
                    a future in that region in which Estonia and the others can prosper and remain
                    free and remain independent of Russia is something that they think is best
                    served at this time by a succession of career ambassadors.</p>
                <p>Q: I think they're right in this case, because political ambassadors,
                    particularly at that level, often are essentially lightweights, and it's a bone
                    thrown out to them and it doesn't carry the weight and probably doesn't let them
                    understand what the situation is.</p>
                <pb facs="0131" n="Page0131"/>
                <p>TAYLOR: Well, I think that's right, and there's another angle, too, and that is
                    it's important to remember in Estonia that the American presence six years ago
                    was one person, a hotel room, a phone, and a fax. And so we're dealing with
                    creating and shaping an American presence as well as American policy in the
                    region, and that means everything is being done from the grassroots in a society
                    in which not everything is available. And frankly, the conditions, although they
                    are getting much, much better, as a result of both Estonia's progress and the
                    hard work of the American employees who have been out there and of our Estonian
                    counterparts, our FSN's who are out there - the conditions in which an
                    Ambassador lives and operates do not approximate those in Western Europe, and I
                    think a great many political appointees would not feel that they are living in
                    the style in which an ambassador should. That all has to be created and done,
                    and they have to do it. You know, you don't ring a bell and staff runs in to
                    take care of your every whim. You have to build the bell. You have to find the
                    staff. It all takes a lot of time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, did you have any problem, or how was your
                        confirmation fothis?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: It was easy. It was a very easy confirmation.</p>
                <p>Q: Before you went out there, what were American interests in Estonia, and what
                    did you see as being sort of your priorities, your one-page list of
                    priorities?</p>
                <p>TAYLOR: Well, you got it right. It is my style to have an agenda and then to work
                    toward that agenda, and I have to be flexible, both with regard to your
                    expectations of progress and with respect to the priorities on the agenda, in
                    case you got it wrong or changing circumstances throw up new ones. But when I
                    arrived in Estonia, I did create an agenda that I worked toward. And part of it
                    was institution-building at the Embassy. When I arrived there, there were about
                    10 American employees. When I left there were in the mid-20s. So we were in a
                    process of growing, and I thought of it in terms of a child, you know, back at
                    conception (when there was one person, a hotel room, a phone, and a fax) and
                    moving toward a fully mature American platform, an embassy capable of achieving
                    America's interests in the country and in the region. I was a part of that. I
                    was there after the conception, and there's certainly a long way to go, so we're
                    not a fully mature adult presence yet. And I thought, just as you take a child
                    through various stages, it's very important to instill the right precedents, the
                    right principles, the right operating structures in this growth process, so I
                    paid a lot of attention to having the Embassy configured in a way that
                    represented American interests looking toward the 21st century and trying to be
                    sure that we did not have an embassy structured to win the Cold War because we'd
                    already done that. But the inertia of Washington tends to want to produce a
                    Cold-War type embassy in a location like that. We didn't need that; we needed
                    one that was pointed to the future. So I worked very closely with the
                    interagency process to see which agencies would come and even in the selection
                    process of the people they sent, to make sure that we had the right kind of
                    people to work together as a team in that embassy.</p>

                <p>Q: How would you compare and contrast a Cold-War embassy with the new-style post-
                    Cold-War embassy in the microcosm that you were dealing with?</p>
                <p>TAYLOR: Well, I think the key thing is that form should fit function, and that
                    our objectives, our functions, in Estonia and in the Baltic States now related
                    to building security, to helping them integrate in to the Western community of
                    nations, building democracy, building a society based on rule of law, and it
                    related very little to learning about and competing with a Soviet monolith that
                    was bent on our own destruction. And so the kinds of people and agencies and
                    programs and activities that we wanted at the Embassy were those capable of
                    contributing effectively and efficiently to these very different objectives and
                    functions.</p>

                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: Well, it's a small country, and you know that going in, but it's a
                    fascinating country. Now you start with the fact that one of my objectives when
                    I arrived was to travel everywhere in the country as quickly as possible. I
                    wanted to do that for a variety of reasons. I wanted to do it because I wanted
                    to learn about the country. I wanted to do it because I wanted all parts of the
                    country and small towns everywhere to see, symbolically, that America cared
                    about them and that we weren't just in the capital. I wanted the people at the
                    Embassy to see that, that our job was to get out of the capital, that it was my
                    job and their job to represent the United States throughout Estonia. So when you
                    say, “What was the impression of Estonia?” I'm talking about an impression of a
                    whole country.</p>
                <p>But of course, you land in the capital. That's where you start, and I had been
                    prepared by briefings that Tallinn, the capital, was an extraordinarily
                    beautiful medieval city, but I was still struck by it. It is one of the gems of
                    Europe, and increasingly now being recognized and discovered by tourists and
                    CODELs and so forth.</p>

                <p>TAYLOR: Congressional delegations. People are beginning to understand that
                    something really nice is there in Estonia, but the country is kind of
                    enchanting. It is small, basically flat, except in southern Estonia there are
                    rolling hills. It is heavily forested, and when you start to put together the
                    geography and the history and the culture of what has gone on on that piece of
                    land, you really do get a sense of history in the making - not just in the past.
                    You are working in a place and with people who have something that is almost a
                    miracle, and that is a second chance at life. They're getting a second chance by
                    a miracle of history. And they and we have a special role now in building a
                    totally new future and inventing a new history and in shaping a new reality, and
                    so I think that spirit infuses almost every American - not just official
                    Americans, the business community and the NGO community as well - who goes to
                    Estonia. You come away with almost a magical feeling that you're not just
                    witnessing something special; you're participating in it and helping to shape
                    it. And it's that spirit, more than anything else - more than the geography,
                    more than the architecture - which remains my first and last impression of
                    Estonia, that we didn't just have a nice job in an interesting and beautiful
                    country and city, we had a unique opportunity to shape a totally different
                    future.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were Estonia's sort of things that keep it going,
                        naturaresources and all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: Everybody asks that question and then everybody says just what you said,
                    “natural resources and all.” Back in the days when I occasionally taught
                    development economics, in my very first lecture I used to give an example of two
                    hypothetical, isolated island countries (so you can't connect it to anything
                    else; they're by themselves), and one had oil and gas and coal and gold and
                    forests and just everything you could imagine, and the other had nothing - it
                    was a barren rock. But of course, one was Japan - it was the barren rock - and
                    the other was Indonesia. One was rich, and one was poor, but it wasn't the one
                    you think when you ask about natural resources. Now what counts, in my view, is
                    people and leadership, and the natural resources of Estonia are its people and
                    its leadership. Now they do have forestry. They do have oil shale. They do have
                    an economic structure that has been built up on its natural resource base and
                    over time, but if you look to the future, Estonia's future is in trying to
                    become - and I think it has the potential, not the certainty, of becoming a Hong
                    Kong or Singapore of the Baltic. And when you think of it in that way, it will
                    be education, it will be leadership, it will be the people skills that spell the
                    difference between success or less than success.</p>

                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: It has its port, and again, from an economic point of view, this should
                    be a service-based economy, a high-technology economy, and entrep�t for the big
                    Petersburg and Moscow hinterland that sits behind it. It's not a market that
                    should be defined by its very small borders but seen as a stepping stone into
                    the huge market to the east. Estonia, I think, has a lot going for it, but the
                    least of it is kind of its traditional natural resource base.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the people, particularly the high proportion
                        oRussians versus native Estonians and all that? How does that work out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: Well, Estonians are surprisingly introverted and almost passive, which is
                    a bit of a shame because inside they have so much beauty and grace and skill but
                    they hide it, and it's a little bit off-putting to people who don't understand
                    that it is there and it is being hidden for cultural reasons. About 30 percent
                    of the country is ethnic Russian. You pointed that out in your question. That
                    constitutes one of the really critical issues in the region, not just within
                    Estonia, because how that situation is dealt with in social, economic,
                    political, and cultural terms could be critical to the evolution of the entire
                    region, and there are a great many problems in all of those areas that need
                    stronger leadership and more involvement by Estonia. But I also want to mention
                    that it is more than a national issue; it is an international issue, in the
                    sense that - in my view, although I want to flag that it is not the view of all
                    my colleagues in Washington, but it is my view - portions of the society in
                    Russia try to use and to manipulate the presence of ethnic colleagues in Estonia
                    and Latvia for their own foreign policy purposes in much the same way that the
                    Germans did in the 1930s with the Sudeten Germans and the Danzig Corridor and so
                    forth. That is, they care not a whit about the actual conditions or trying to
                    ameliorate or improve them; they simply want to use the fact of their presence
                    in order to try to justify and legitimize a reach into Estonian sovereignty,
                    both to pressure Estonian authorities on other issues (basically security and
                    foreign policy issues) and also to confuse the West about whether Estonia and
                    Latvia are countries that you can really trust. Are these the kind of countries
                    that you really want to bring in to your clubs and organizations? Or aren't they
                    a little risky? Aren't they a little problematic? Aren't they human rights
                    abusers? And so the foreign policy dimension of this issue was one of the things
                    that I worked most consistently on during my time in Tallinn, and of course, the
                    Embassy, and myself included, traveled extensively to the areas where the ethnic
                    Russians live in greatest numbers, both to stay on top of developments, but also
                    to establish networks of contacts with them and their communities and
                    organizations, and to be sure that they understood that we represented the
                    United States to them as well. One of the things that I insisted on as
                    ambassador, for example, was that agencies that have programs whose purpose was
                    to operate in Estonia, had to operate in the ethnic Russian areas of Estonia,
                    too. I insisted we have Peace Corps volunteers in Narva and in Sillam�e and in
                    Kohtla-J�rve and in these northeast cities and villages and communities, because
                    we weren't just going to have those programs for Estonians. They were operating
                    in Estonia, and we were going to have them for all the people that lived in
                    Estonia.</p>

                    Estonian community in the United States is that sometimes they feel that
                    Washington believes what Moscow is saying about the treatment of ethnic
                    colleagues, and that's their concern, that somehow, out of either ignorance or
                    out of a desire to get along with Russia, Washington will turn a blind eye to
                    the reality of the situation in Estonia and Latvia and sort of will let Russia
                    get away with using these ethnic colleagues as a foreign policy lever on the

                <pb facs="0136" n="Page0136"/>
                <p>TAYLOR: Oh, golly, yes. This was a big part of our job and our presence in
                    Estonia. First of all, just remember, I did insist U.S. programs operate in
                    those areas. In terms of discretionary programmatic support from the Embassy, we
                    had the Democracy Small Grant Fund and so forth. Right at the top of that list
                    were programs that built cultural connectivity and ethnic relations and
                    community relations between Estonians and ethnic Russians. We did that to give
                    them support but also to indicate our priorities to Estonian authorities. I
                    worked personally very closely with the President of Estonia, the Prime Minister
                    of Estonia, the Foreign Minister of Estonia on the need for Estonia to give a
                    stronger focus to this issue and to undertake common-sense initiatives - within
                    their legal structure, which was fully consistent with Western norms - to go
                    beyond the bare minimum and to take common-sense initiatives that made it easier
                    for these communities to relate to each other and made it easier for Russians to
                    live with some sense of contentment and satisfaction in Estonia. But there's a
                    real historical legacy here. It's not going to happen in a year or two, but it
                    can happen in a generation. I think it's too late for people in their 50s and
                    60s. You know, you have to put yourself in the position of the ethnic Russians.
                    They weren't, for the most part, born in Estonia. They were transported there by
                    Stalin after World War II to man or to be the labor for these huge Soviet-style
                    industrial and chemical projects built on the base of Estonian oil shale. They
                    came to Estonia at the height of the Soviet empire. They never learned a word of
                    Estonian. They expected Estonians to speak Russian to them, even though they
                    were in Estonia. They were the top dogs. The Communist Party organizations ran
                    everything, decided everything. They were on top of the world, at least the
                    world that existed in that little region. Now all of a sudden that's all gone,
                    and there's a new world and they're not on top any more. The Communist Party
                    means nothing; in fact, it's discredited. If you speak Russian, that's fine, but
                    no Estonian is going to speak it to you. Why don't you speak Estonian? You've
                    lived here for 40 years, but you haven't learned it. That generation isn't going
                    to make the adjustment. Nothing in their life experience - not their education,
                    not at home, not in the community - has ever prepared them to live in a
                    democratic, market-oriented Estonia. These are words that are mind-boggling to
                    them, yet we think democratic, market-oriented, independent Estonia are positive
                    words, but for them they're frightening words. So psychologically the older
                    generation is just going to have to be allowed, in some reasonable comfort, to
                    fade off the scene, but there's no reason why their children and grandchildren
                    can't be fully integrated into all of the rights and opportunities of an Estonia
                    that is growing very rapidly and that is moving toward membership in the
                    European Union. So that's where the targeting, in our view, should be, and we
                    worked very hard with Estonian authorities to get them to try to do a lot more
                    to strengthen the process of integration and to ease the kind of bureaucratic
                    and legal barriers to integration in Estonia.</p>

                    requirement. The older generation is never going to be able to. They haven's
                    learned anything in 40 years, and they're too old to learn it. But the younger
                    generation can pick up a reasonable level immediately. They can't pick it up on
                    the streets because the Russians all live together, so the street language where
                    they live is Russian, as well as at home and in the school. So they need to pick
                    it up in the school, and this is where we worked again with the Estonian
                    authorities to try to make them understand the importance of training and
                    motivating a sufficient number of Estonian teachers to staff all of those
                    schools. This was in the self-interest of everybody looking out a generation,
                    that we remove this problem of language proficiency in terms of citizenship, so
                    these were the kinds of things that the Embassy was extremely active in.</p>

                <p>Q: So I would think it would be awkward for essentially a very sophisticated
                    people to be telling them how to manage their own country, that it would be very
                    apparent to an American, would it not?</p>
                <pb facs="0138" n="Page0138"/>
                <p>TAYLOR: One of the things we tried to do was not to tell them how to manage their
                    own country. I mean, the approach that we took in this area was not to tell them
                    how to manage their own country and not to do it for them, but to resist the
                    temptation to pile in an international presence in these areas that was doing
                    this, but rather to find those Estonians, those leaders, those organizations and
                    those communities who themselves had come to understand the importance of this
                    and to work with them to give them more strength, so that when we saw
                    leadership, we followed it, and when we saw organizations that said, “We want to
                    do this on the ground,” we supported it, trying to help them build critical mass
                    for success. Now again, it's a situation in which there are a lot of priorities
                    and limited resources, and these groups and these leaders have to be successful
                    in balancing all of them off and keeping their own authority and their own
                    credibility. I think on the margin we certainly made a lot of good progress by
                    supporting their leadership, by strengthening their organizations and
                    institutions that were trying to do the right thing, but it is a very difficult
                    and long-term process.</p>
                <p>Q: You're saying that the Estonians, at least on the outside, were a rather
                    introverted group, but how about on the Russian side? Were there leaders that
                    were developing out of that who understood the situation? Was there a beginning
                    of a mating process?</p>
                <p>TAYLOR: There were some good Russian leaders who did step forward, but again, the
                    critical element is the youth, and I think the youth, frankly, is still up for
                    grabs. But there still is one overriding advantage that Estonia has in that, and
                    that is that every Russian, whether they're 65 or whether they're 15, knows that
                    conditions in Estonia are so much better for them than conditions in Russia,
                    that even if they feel discriminated against or second-class in Estonia, they
                    are living better and they have many more opportunities by living in Estonia.
                    And particularly the young people know that one aspect of this is enormously
                    important and you don't want to rock this boat too hard, and that is Estonia is
                    on its way to Brussels, in a figurative, metaphorical sense. It is becoming - it
                    will become in the lifetime of these young Russians - fully European, a member
                    of the European Community, and that means that those young Russians will be
                    European. Across the River, across the Narva river in Russia, their
                    grandchildren won't be European. This is a huge advantage that accrues to
                    everybody who lives there, and it's one of the reasons the younger Russians,
                    even though they don't care much for Estonians and Estonia... And I still have a
                    question mark. If that was all it is, I think it would be very much up for
                    grabs, but they know they can ride Estonia to Brussels and they can become fully
                    European. This is a tremendous advantage in terms of encouraging young people
                    not to rock the boat too much.</p>
                <p>Q: Well, were there Estonian nationalists who were pounding the drums trying to
                    create divisions as some of the politicians in Russia were doing?</p>
                <pb facs="0139" n="Page0139"/>
                <p>TAYLOR: Not too much any more. They were more vocal in the early days, sort of
                    seeking some sort of accounting for the past and I think hoping, sometimes
                    openly, that maybe all the Russians could be deported or something and Estonia
                    could be purely Estonian. You know, that's just unrealistic, and their day, if
                    it had ever come, had come and gone by the time I got there. They're still
                    around, but they're widely regarded as way off on the fringe, and they don't
                    exercise much political power in Estonia now. But I think this issue is
                    manageable in a positive way if the Estonians will only give a little bit more
                    leadership to make it a little higher priority and if Russia does not - either
                    because it does not want to or because the international community does not
                    allow it - if Russia does not manipulate and stir up that situation to cause
                    problems that otherwise would not exist.</p>
                <p>Q: I would have thought that this would have been a country where particularly
                    the Swedes and the Finns and perhaps the Germans, too, would have been really
                    interested in working on development roles.</p>
                <p>TAYLOR: The Germans are obsessed with East Germany and Central Europe, and have
                    been quite a disappointment to the Estonians, because given the Baltic German
                    heritage there, historically I think they had hoped and expected for a stronger
                    degree of interest from Germany, but you can bet your bottom dollar the Swedes,
                    Finns, and Danes are extraordinarily active there in terms of promoting
                    development. In fact, Estonians deserve credit for their own success, and
                    they've been the shining star, not just of the Baltic States, but of all of the
                    societies that have emerged now reconstituted and independent from the Rubble of
                    the Soviet empire. But some of that success is connected to the tremendous
                    amount of support and continuing support that comes from Sweden, Finland, and
                    Denmark to Estonia in particular, especially Finland!</p>
                <p>Q: Well, were you working in harness, more or less, with the Swedes, Finns, and
                    Danes about directing this? I mean, did they have the same feeling about, say,
                    the Russian minority and making sure that it rose along with the Estonians?</p>
                <pb facs="0140" n="Page0140"/>
                <p>TAYLOR: Oh, yes. That was a common theme in the international community. You
                    mentioned earlier that I had an agenda. I'll just tell you what it was. The
                    first I mentioned, which was helping to build and to shape a rapidly growing
                    U.S. presence into one that was a 21st-century embassy and not a Cold-War
                    embassy. The second was to phase out our foreign assistance to Estonia in a way
                    that allowed both sides to feel good about the program and to treat it not as a
                    close-out, as it had been described when I was appointed (that decision had
                    already been made and I couldn't do much about that), but rather as a
                    graduation, and to feel good in the sense that we had contributed to their
                    ability to graduate and they could feel good that they had graduated, they had
                    made it. The third was to reorient Estonian foreign policy in a way that would
                    give them a greater chance of reaching a border settlement and a normalization
                    with Russia. And the fourth was to reorient Estonian foreign policy in a way
                    that would help them understand that they were unlikely to be in the first round
                    of NATO enlargement and that they shouldn't be disappointed by that but, rather,
                    seek further opportunities to strengthen their integration into Western
                    political and security institutions and that NATO membership, important as they
                    might think it is, was only one means to a much broader end. And then the last
                    one was sort of a micro-, but it was very important to me, and that was to try
                    to obtain a suitable residence for the American ambassador. You know, we all
                    began six years ago. Every Western country coming into a newly independent
                    Estonia began in a hotel room. But six years have gone by, and when I arrived
                    there, virtually every other Western embassy had an ambassadorial residence that
                    was truly that and that said something symbolically to Americans, but
                    particularly to the region, to Estonians and others, that this country was here
                    to stay and they thought Estonia was a real country. We did not. For some
                    reason, we were at the tail end, and there's no reason for the most important
                    country to Estonia to be sending a signal that maybe the Ambassador is living in
                    a transit billet while the United States decides whether to stay or go. And so I
                    thought for a lot of very good reasons, ranging from - frankly - my own comfort
                    and ability to do my job in a representational and a promotional sense, but all
                    the way to the symbolic importance of the statement we made by having a
                    residence, that I had to take that on as a priority as well.</p>
                <p>So there it was: building an embassy; phasing out the aid program in a kind of
                    unique, creative, positive way; trying to help Estonia turn its foreign policy
                    with Russia into constructive engagement instead of the kind of hostile
                    confrontation it was when I arrived; and trying to help Estonia understand that
                    NATO membership, important as it might seem, was only a means to an end and that
                    they shouldn't be so disappointed that they failed to try to build new
                    opportunities to integrate into the West; and then finally to focus on obtaining
                    a residence that was appropriate for an American ambassador.</p>
                <p>Q: What about the borders of Estonia with Latvia and Russia? Are these pretty
                    well established?</p>
                <pb facs="0141" n="Page0141"/>
                <p>TAYLOR: With Latvia it was very well established. With Russia it's still not.
                    Trying to nurture a border agreement between Estonia and Russia was part of one
                    of these priorities, this reorientation toward positive engagement. When I
                    arrived there the Estonian negotiating position was that Russia must recognize
                    that the Estonian state began with the Treaty of Tartu in the 1920s, as part of
                    the border settlement. They weren't interested in changing the actual physical
                    border, but they wanted the agreement to contain a legitimization of their birth
                    certificate in the 1920s. The Russians were unwilling to do that. The Russians
                    still argue that the incorporation of the Baltic States into the Soviet Union in
                    the 1940s was a legitimate act and not an illegitimate act, and they did not
                    want to date the legitimacy of the current political systems from the 1920s. Now
                    over time, and with the encouragement of the United States government, the
                    Estonians dropped their demand about the Treaty of Tartu, but that proved to be
                    insufficient to bring Russia to signing the agreement, even though Russia had
                    been saying all along that that was the reason that they would not sign. But the
                    Estonians got to the point where they simply surrendered. They surprisingly went
                    to a meeting, surprisingly to the Russians (they had worked it out with us), and
                    said we agree to all your positions, so let's sign. It wasn't good enough; it
                    still hasn't been signed. The Russians decided there were other problems.</p>
                <p>Q: What about the cooperation between your embassy and that in Moscow? Was there
                    pretty much on the same wavelength, or localitis took over?</p>
                <pb facs="0142" n="Page0142"/>
                <p>TAYLOR: Well, I'm sure they thought I had localitis, and I was sure they did. I
                    would say when Tom Pickering was there it was very good. Tom was excellent on
                    the big issues and always handled issues with professional excellence. But I'll
                    tell you, in my view - and you'll get a different view from my colleagues in
                    Moscow and in the Department who worked on Russia - but in my view, American
                    interests in the Baltic States are threatened mainly by two things. The first is
                    that we lose sight of them. They're so small, and we have other priorities, and
                    so we sort of forget about them until it's too late. And the second is that we
                    don't understand that our own bureaucratic system that has five hundred people
                    working on Russia for every one working on Estonia has a certain bureaucratic
                    weight and momentum to it that can sideswipe our policies in the Baltics. And
                    what I found was that there were too many people, in Washington as well as in
                    Moscow in our embassy, who would be aware of what the Estonians said about an
                    issue - for example, the treatment of ethnic Russians in Estonia - and they'd be
                    aware of what the Russians said about it, and then they would wring their hands
                    and say, well, we don't know, so we'll split the difference. This is splitting
                    the difference between a truth and a lie, and it's not a good basis for American
                    foreign policy, at least for a successful policy. And they would ignore the fact
                    that we weren't splitting the difference. We lived in Estonia. We didn't accept
                    what the Estonians told us. We went and saw. We worked with the Russians, and so
                    did every other Western embassy, and so did the OSCE [Organization for Security
                    and Cooperation in Europe], which has a presence in Estonia. And so did a
                    variety of NGOs [non-governmental organizations], who were working on these
                    issues in those localities every day. And all of us who did that saw it the same
                    way. So we felt that splitting the difference, when you have an embassy and when
                    you have an international presence, when you have an OSCE presence, that
                    splitting the difference between what the Estonians said and what the Russians
                    said was really not an appropriate basis for making American foreign policy. I
                    should say things did change. There were some leadership changes in Washington
                    and events in Russia in 1998 introduced more realism into our regional policy.
                    We have it right now, but it was rocky for a while.</p>

                <p>TAYLOR: Oh, no. I mean, you have to understand that when you go to the... And
                    this is interesting in a number of ways, because it is one of the threats to
                    stability in the region that needs to be come to grips with by international
                    policy, in my view, but when you cross the border from Estonia into Russia - you
                    know, it takes a few yards to cross a border; there is a line, and on one side
                    of it there is Estonia and on the other side there is Russia - when you cross
                    that border, you are in every way - in every way - literally transforming,
                    moving, from the late 20th century to the late 19th century. One of the great
                    problems with the “oldthink” in American foreign policy is that the Baltic
                    States have always existed in the shadow of great powers - of Sweden, of Poland,
                    of Germany, for the last several hundred years of Russia - and that people who
                    have worked on especially Russia in our system for a long time have that natural
                    perspective on them. But with the end of the Cold War and with the dramatic
                    changes that have occurred, both in the Baltic States and in Russia, the truth
                    is that the Baltic States, and especially Estonia, have become the light-giving
                    source, small as they are, and the policy job is to extend that light of market
                    reform and market success, of political reform and political success, of social
                    reform and social success, from the Baltic States east, and to try to help
                    transform, by doing so, those adjacent sections of Russia and perhaps reach all
                    the way to Petersburg. Anything that Petersburg sends to the Baltics now is
                    something that the Baltics don't need. It has to go the other way. Now if you
                    look 50 years out, of course there's a natural size and density issue here that
                    should reassert itself, but in this transitional phase, it is really policies
                    that try to move the success of the Baltic States east that are likely to be
                    most successful in life.</p>
                <p>Q: Was there any spillover of the massive breakdown of society, of industry,
                    corruption, gangs, the whole thing in Russia? Did that spill over into
                    Estonia?</p>
                <p>TAYLOR: It certainly spilled over into Estonia in the early years, especially in
                    terms of organized criminal activity and Mafioso groups and so forth. Estonia's
                    gotten it under better control in the last few years. One of the agencies that I
                    did bring in to the Embassy and I think has been very useful is the FBI, which
                    now has a regional office in our Embassy in Tallinn. Now although the Estonians
                    argue that they have eliminated these Russian groups and these major criminal
                    organizations, I have to tell you I don't buy that. I hope it's true, but I
                    think what's happened is that criminality in Estonia has developed as Estonia
                    has developed, and in the rough-and-tumble early days, you could see the Mafioso
                    types with their cars and their guns and behaving like they did in Chicago in
                    the 20s and 30s. Estonia is moving very rapidly into a modern economy, and I
                    think the criminal groups still exist; I think they're wearing coats and ties
                    and they're at their computers. They have just stepped up several notches as
                    Estonia has stepped up several notches. So that's something we need to keep our
                    eye on, in my view, because part of the success of Estonia really is associated
                    with this banking sector and service sector, and we do need to be careful that
                    this doesn't become a major center of international money-laundering and illegal
                    transfers and so forth. Even while people say there's no more criminal activity
                    here, just look around.</p>
                <pb facs="0144" n="Page0144"/>
                <p>Q: Well, in the Baltic States, what's the pecking order between Lithuania,
                    Latvia, and Estonia as far as success and all, and be objective?</p>
                <p>TAYLOR: Well, you know, these are three very different countries, and that is an
                    issue in and of itself because we call them the Baltic States, and I think
                    politically in the United States they're more powerful when they go under that
                    umbrella, but in reality, they are three different languages, three different
                    cultures, different religions, different histories, different values. They don't
                    have very much in common except geography. Now I don't think there's any doubt
                    that Estonia is significantly ahead on the economic front, and its selection as
                    potential first-wave entry into EU enlargement is an indication that that
                    judgment is widely shared. Estonian leadership “seized the moment” in 1992-1993
                    and made remarkable policy reforms and initiatives on the economic front. Beyond
                    that, I wouldn't know how to rate them. I suspect that, in a military sense, for
                    example, Estonia might be the least of those three capable of contributing
                    significantly to, say, NATO or an international security system. So there's a
                    lot of different standards and different measures, but in the kind of the
                    classical economic measures, I think it's pretty clear that Estonia has gone out
                    ahead. But Latvia and Lithuania are catching up now.</p>
                <p>Q: What about the Holocaust? I used to be a refugee relief officer and dealt with
                    people coming out of camps around, and if I recall, the Estonians were actually
                    - all the Baltic States - the ethnic ones there ran some of the nastiest camps,
                    particularly against the Jews but with others. Was this something that you got
                    involved in?</p>
                <pb facs="0145" n="Page0145"/>
                <p>TAYLOR: Sure. As you can see by recent news accounts of developments in Latvia,
                    history weighs heavily on all of these societies, and the World War II
                    experience is something that weighs extremely heavily. People try to reinvent
                    it; they try to forget it; they try to distort it. The best that can be said is
                    that of a lot of Estonians, they will legitimately say that history dealt them a
                    cruel hand, that if you wanted to fight for Estonia, you either had to fight for
                    Stalin or you had to fight for Hitler. There wasn't any other choice. Or you
                    could run away and not fight, but that was your choice, and once you did that
                    you were trapped in a system that was doing a lot of other things that may or
                    may not have been to your liking. The worst that can be said is just what you
                    said: that there were an awful lot of willing accomplices to the worst aspects
                    of both the Soviet and the Nazi systems. Now Estonia had a very small pre-war
                    Jewish population, unlike Lithuania and Latvia. There were only about 10,000
                    Jews in Estonia prior to the war, and they were relatively well integrated by
                    standards, but they were exterminated, either there in Estonia or sent somewhere
                    else. There were, then, a couple of camps. The Nazis established a couple of
                    camps in Estonia in which Jews from other parts of Europe were brought in and
                    exterminated. The Russians built a monument out near Paldiski, about 40 minutes
                    outside of Tallinn, at one of those camps, and a new monument was raised in
                    1994-95 by the newly independent Estonian government to the same thing. There's
                    still a small Jewish community in Estonia now, a few hundred people. We had good
                    relations with it, and we had good relations with international American Jewish
                    groups who were concerned about the legacy of World War II and how countries
                    were treating issues associated with restitution and property and so forth. But
                    there's no doubt that horrible things happened in Estonia as they happened
                    elsewhere and that, although people would like to forget it and blame it all on
                    Nazis or Germans, Nazis and Germans had a lot of willing collaborators in
                    Estonia as elsewhere.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you describe the government you're dealing with,
                        some othe personalities and how one dealt with the Estonian government?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0146" n="Page0146"/>
                <p>TAYLOR: Well, it was a very easy government to deal with at a certain level,
                    because you could divide (for convenience's sake - they would never divide
                    themselves that way), but it was easy for an outsider like myself to divide
                    Estonian leadership into those that had a world view and had a world awareness
                    and those who thought the world began and ended in Estonia. And the latter group
                    was very hard to deal with on anything, frankly. It was a real problem. The
                    former group, though, was extraordinarily easy to deal with. They all spoke four
                    or five languages; they all had traveled extensively; they all had advanced
                    degrees by Western standards; and they were all determined to reintegrate
                    Estonia into the Western democratic community of nations. And so the Western
                    embassies - and foremost among them the United States Embassy - were natural
                    contacts for them as much as they were for us, and they were as interested in
                    facilitating, nurturing and developing the relationship as we were. So it was
                    with many of the key Estonian leaders. I would get a call at midnight or so for
                    the President to come on over to the palace or to the house, and off I would go,
                    and they would show up at my home, and it was just sort of like being almost
                    friends in a local community here in the United States. That was the ease of the
                    contact and the relationship.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any major issues during this time. I mean, were
                        yohit? What was it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: Well, some of the ones I mentioned were the Russia, the NATO, types of
                    things, the situation of ethnic Russians living in Estonia - all these things
                    were chronic, major things that were worked on over a long period of time. But
                    right away, when I arrived, we were hit, both myself personally as well as many
                    others, but also Estonia - we were all traumatized by the tragic death of Bob
                    Frazier. Bob had been the first ambassador in Estonia; I was the second. And I
                    thought the world of Bob, as did many other people who knew him, and of course,
                    Estonia had a special place in its heart for Bob as the first American
                    ambassador.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you explain what happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: Yes, Bob was tragically killed in an automobile accident on a winding
                    road in Bosnia, and dealing with that, the feelings that the country had, that
                    we all had, that the FSN's had, that the Estonian leadership had was something
                    that we just had to take on right away and do right, and I think we did. It
                    sounds very personalized and small in a way, but it was quite a shock to us all
                    and an emotional thing for us all and something that we had to handle in an
                    appropriate and sensitive way if we were going to be proud of ourselves, all of
                    us as we moved forward. And it think we did.</p>
                <p>Q: What was the Estonian view of events in Bosnia, because this was the whole
                    development in the area, break up different ethnic groups and all that, and they
                    must have taken a much harder look at it than, say, one of the Western
                    countries?</p>
                <pb facs="0147" n="Page0147"/>
                <p>TAYLOR: The Estonian view of the events in Bosnia really boils down to something
                    much more basic. Estonia wants strong U.S. leadership. Estonia sees its own
                    future associated with that more than anything else, and Estonia wants it and
                    will always support it, regardless of how it might differ analytically about
                    events on the ground. And so Estonia welcomed the more assertive U.S. role that
                    emerged in the mid-1990s and immediately volunteered to do whatever it could to
                    support us.</p>
                <p>Q: Well, did you find, when you first went out there, the Clinton Administration
                    was beginning to find its feet, and I can't remember exactly how you would time
                    it, but maybe by '95 it wasn't looking too “ept” in the field of foreign
                    affairs. I mean Clinton obviously was not focused on doing things in the foreign
                    affairs field, and did you notice that, and did you notice a change when we
                    decided to say “the hell with this” in Bosnia and also in Haiti and we put
                    troops in and we started doing things?</p>
                <p>TAYLOR: Well, absolutely. Again, the Estonians want that U.S. leadership and
                    they're not going to second-guess it. They just want strong U.S. leadership.
                    They're going to support it - for selfish reasons, because they believe, they're
                    whole history and geography tells them that regardless of circumstances today,
                    there will come a time again when push comes to shove in that part of the
                    region, and their whole freedom will be put under a cloud. And when that
                    happens, as they think it will, some day in some way, people in Moscow are not
                    going to care what people in Helsinki or Bonn or London or Oslo think. They're
                    only going to care what people in Washington think. So that is something the
                    Estonians have fixed very clearly. That is why the Estonians want in NATO,
                    frankly, and not in WEU [Western European Union]. They want a Transatlantic
                    security relationship; they do not want a European security relationship
                    alone.</p>
                <p>Now that being said, let me also say that, while I agree in general about your
                    characterization of the first years of the Clinton Administration as more or
                    less finding their ways in foreign policy and maybe in other things as well,
                    that was, with respect to the Baltics (as opposed to Bosnia or Somalia or
                    somewhere else) not the case. The President had already established quite a
                    positive involvement and legacy in the Baltics. He had visited Riga in 1994, was
                    a smashing success, a smashing symbolic and substantive success. The Baltic
                    States achieved their independence in '91 and '92, but Russian troops did not
                    leave until '94, and there was a question all the way up to the day they left as
                    to whether they would really leave. And I think the Baltic leaders rightly
                    understand that without President Clinton's personal involvement in that
                    question, the Russians probably would not have left. So we have that. Vice
                    President Gore had gone to the region. Vice President Gore was in Estonia in
                    March or April, I forget which, of 1995, so he had personally taken a role out
                    there. So American foreign policy in this part of the world was actually seen as
                    a success at that point. It was not finding its legs; it was on sound
                    ground.</p>
                <pb facs="0148" n="Page0148"/>
                <p>Q: Did you have any conversations with the Estonian leadership concerning sort of
                    the Western European economic union and the United States with NATO? I mean,
                    were you being told sort of face to face, well, Western Europe hasn't really
                    gotten its act together, it really is not a force that we can depend on, where
                    the United States? Did you get that from them?</p>
                <p>TAYLOR: From the Estonians?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: Not so directly. They didn't say it in those terms. But I think the job
                    that I tried to do was to take whatever they were saying, and it certainly came
                    from the same sentiments you just talked about, and try to build on it and
                    enlarge it and help them understand that their security was part of a broad and
                    long-term process of reconnecting to Western institutions, big and small, across
                    a full spectrum of economic, political, security, military, social, cultural,
                    educational relationships. It was not one issue. It was not NATO, much as they
                    had hoped that it would be and could be. But the fact that it wouldn't be NATO,
                    at least in the first round, in no way jeopardized this wider process of
                    reintegration and reconnecting. And if they pursued that, they would be building
                    their security in important ways. And I think we were successful over time in
                    helping them see their security as a process rather than as an event. When I
                    went there they saw it as an event, the date they got in NATO. And I think now,
                    as a result of some time and some thinking and a lot of intervening
                    developments, they do see it as a process by which they continue over time to
                    strengthen their connection across this full spectrum of relationships.</p>
                <p>Q: What about country ties with the United States? Were Estonian students headed
                    off to the United States to go to MIT and Chicago and other places for academic
                    training?</p>
                <p>TAYLOR: Yes, Estonians do come to the United States as well as to other Western
                    countries for training and for education. Again, that was a big priority for me
                    at the Embassy, to find ways to strengthen, and to create where there didn't
                    exist, new training and new educational links between our two countries because
                    in a country the size of Estonia, there will always be an elite of a few hundred
                    people who run the country - that's inevitable. It would be different people,
                    depending on the system, you know, but that's an inevitability. And I was sure
                    that if we had an aggressive training and educational development in our
                    relationship that we could actually train and educate the next generation of
                    Estonian leadership and that this would work to our advantage as well as to
                    theirs, but certainly to our advantage over the generation ahead. So we did an
                    awful lot to encourage that training and that education, and in the areas in
                    which we had more influence, such as admission to our service academies, for
                    example, the Estonians have the best per capita (they're a very small country)
                    ratio of attendance of any foreign country in U.S. service academies. That's not
                    by accident. We worked very hard to make sure the Estonians are getting into all
                    of these school.</p>
                <pb facs="0149" n="Page0149"/>
                <p>Q: With the arrows in your particular quiver, were you able to get schools like
                    MIT and, you know, the major schools in the United States to look favorably on
                    Estonia, or was money a problem?</p>
                <p>TAYLOR: Well, money is always a problem with Estonians, you know, for all their
                    economic success, and it has been dramatic, certainly on a relative basis, the
                    per capita income in Estonia is still about $300 a month. So, you know, we're
                    starting from a very low base. Now the past few years, given the fluidity and
                    flexibility of these transitional situations, there have been some families that
                    have become millionaires and more literally overnight. Now they, of course, can
                    afford what they wish, but for most Estonians there really does need to be some
                    sort of financial assistance and support mechanism. But they are a culture that
                    has always valued education. You know, in the 1890s, Estonians had literally a
                    literacy rate in the 90 percent, at a time when the United States had not half
                    that probably. And so it is a culture that expects to make sacrifices and has a
                    commitment to education, almost just naturally, and Estonia is also a country
                    where the leadership has a keen awareness that, given its size and given its
                    location, its role is as part of the global system. It cannot be an island unto
                    itself. And so there is a commitment to learning foreign languages, and there is
                    a commitment to travel and studying abroad. There are conflicting forces bearing
                    on the ability of Estonians, how fast and how many can move into the U.S. or any
                    foreign educational system, but given all of those things, I think it's
                    remarkable how well they're doing.</p>
                <p>Q: Did you find as we talk about this in the 1990s we're going through a
                    tremendous revolution, and we're talking about the Internet communications and
                    that sort of thing which will be old hat when somebody reads this a couple of
                    years from now. But we're really talking about being at the very beginning of
                    this. Did you see a sort of willingness and interest in turning to this new form
                    of communication so that you were part of the global -</p>
                <pb facs="0150" n="Page0150"/>
                <p>TAYLOR: Estonia has one of, if not the highest per capita utilization of the
                    Internet in Europe - an extraordinary thing of a society that's been where it
                    has for the last 50 years that has a per capita income of about $300 a month and
                    in which the ownership of individual computers is very limited. So its
                    commitment to education, looking historically, has been to the sciences, and it
                    is a society that is very skilled in sciences and takes almost naturally to
                    technology changes. And it's a society that has a very good capability in
                    software programming already, for example. And then there's leadership for that.
                    I came back with the President of Estonia and met with Vice President Gore in
                    October of 1995, in which the Estonian President asked for the Vice President's
                    assistance in encouraging American industry to place the Internet in every
                    Estonian classroom, and that project has gone forward. It's called the “Tiger's
                    Leap” in Estonia, and it is very successful. The Vice President, in turn,
                    encouraged Estonia to become part of the Globe system, and the Estonians
                    immediately agreed and have now signed their schools on to the Globe system. And
                    so yes, in every way, this is an extraordinary commitment to using the new
                    technology and being part of the new technology as a subset of their broader
                    reintegration into the West, their commitment to free market principles and
                    their commitment to being economically successful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you say Estonians, what about - in the Internet,
                        schoosystems, and so forth - what about the Russians? Are they part of
                        that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: The schools are part of it, right. The Russian schools iEstonia are part
                    of it, because it was “every school in Estonia.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find the Russians, the younger generation, were
                        they new breed?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: They certainly are a new breed, and they're also computer-literate;
                    they're also looking west as well as east, because they have families in the
                    east the way the Estonians do not, but they have a whole new attitude from,
                    again, they weren't part of the communist system; they didn't depend on it the
                    way their fathers and grandfathers and grandmothers did, and so yes, they're a
                    totally new breed.</p>
                <p>Q: What about the Embassy as far as one of your priorities was to make it a
                    post-Cold- War embassy? By the time you left, how was it structured that might
                    be different than sort of a traditional embassy?</p>
                <pb facs="0151" n="Page0151"/>
                <p>TAYLOR: Well, again, I think the answer to that question lies less in
                    organizational names than it does in understanding the activities and the
                    programs and the purposes of the mission as a whole, and what we tried to do -
                    and you can do it in a small embassy that's brand new, where you don't inherit a
                    traditional modus operandi and all of the baggage that comes with that that's
                    decades and decades old - everybody who gets off the plane is brand new there
                    and has sort of got to move forward without necessarily having anything to build
                    on - and so I spent a lot of effort trying to build a real embassy team, to have
                    in practice what we talk about back here as being the theory of an embassy, and
                    that meant, and in a small embassy we could do it, that I sat with the leaders
                    of all the agencies and sometimes all the staff, and we sat there together as
                    America's team and tried to use the skills and- (end of tape)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were saying that the country team-</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: Yes, to try to function as one team using the skills and abilities of
                    each of the people and the agencies they represented to strengthen the programs
                    and the activities of the Embassy that were focused on these post-Cold-War,
                    21st-century-agenda items. And that, I think, is the distinguishing feature of
                    what we tried to do in differentiating ourselves from a Cold-War embassy.</p>
                <p>Q: Did you find yourself dealing with the other great power, the European Bureau
                    [EUR]? Did you find you were kind of far down in the feeding order and in a way
                    you could almost do your own thing?</p>
                <p>TAYLOR: Yes, I think the Department has been through such a series of resource
                    cutbacks and had so many other priorities. At that time the European Bureau, for
                    example, had Bosnia on its plate. But the leadership had precious little time
                    for much else, and certainly not much time for us. So we did work a lot on our
                    own, and there were a lot of advantages to that, as you can imagine. There were
                    some disadvantages because in a situation where you are new and growing and in
                    which you are on the front lines, sometimes you need a little bit of help in
                    Washington in order to get things done. So yes, I think you hit the nail on the
                    head.</p>
                <p>Q: Did you have visits from overly enthusiastic or maybe just plain enthusiastic
                    Estonian-Americans who wanted to go in and change everything and turn it into
                    another America or something like that?</p>
                <pb facs="0152" n="Page0152"/>
                <p>TAYLOR: Well, that period was largely over. We did have a lot of visits from
                    Estonian-Americans. In the first couple of years of Estonian independence, the
                    Estonian diaspora - not just from the U.S. but from all over the world - flooded
                    back in there, some of them to try to make a difference, some of them to try to
                    make a fast buck, some of them to try to remake Estonia in the image that they
                    had in their minds but which was impossible. But a lot of sorting out had gone
                    on already, and some of the crazies and the ones that weren't going to be
                    successful had departed, and the Estonians who had been there throughout the
                    Soviet period had kind of reasserted themselves, with a few of the
                    better-qualified and really committed representatives of the diaspora scattered
                    around in important positions, but clearly not remaking the country in their
                    image, rather working for the country's leadership.</p>
                <p>Now we also had a lot of official visitors, and I'll tell you, although some of
                    my staff occasionally grew restive, I encouraged and welcomed all visitors
                    because I saw each one as an opportunity to make a new friend for what we were
                    doing there and building an understanding of our role and our importance. And I
                    wanted to make sure that every American who came to the Embassy and came to
                    Estonia in some capacity that we dealt with left with that higher understanding
                    and a supporter of the American government's role in the region and in the
                    country. So I saw each of these visits as a unique opportunity to help build the
                    future we were all working toward, and not as kind of the nuisance and problem
                    that, if you saw it from a different perspective, it might appear.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, if you're in Paris or something, you know they're
                        interested in shopping and that sort of thing, and it's a pain in the ass.
                        But if you're in a small place, this is your unique good time to get them
                        and corral them and put them in a corner and tell them what you're
                        doing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TAYLOR: Right. And take them around the country and show them. Right. A lot of
                    the support that we got in the future came from people who had been there and
                    seen it and understood it for themselves.</p>
                <p>Q: Was there the equivalent of a Baltic League of American ambassadors with the
                    Latvian, Lithuanian men or women in those places? Did you get together much?</p>
                <p>TAYLOR: Yes, the three of us got together about three times a year, and then a
                    wider ring, including our colleagues from Finland, Sweden, Norway, and Denmark,
                    got together about once a year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find this useful?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0153" n="Page0153"/>
                <p>TAYLOR: It's essential. In fact, we should have done more of it. In part, I'll
                    tell you - again, I don't want to be overly critical - but this sort of thing
                    helped compensate for the lack of interest and leadership from Washington on
                    these issues. You just had to have somebody occasionally at that level to talk
                    to and to sort through some of these issues, especially issues that were
                    regional and international in their effects. And so these meetings were very
                    helpful, and then particularly with my colleague, the U.S. ambassador in Latvia,
                    but also in Lithuania, we were on the phone an awful lot to each other
                    discussing things, and there were some issues that were of such importance, we
                    thought, that we would draft one cable and send it in from all three of us - it
                    would come from all three of us - in an effort to give it greater weight and
                    greater power in the system.</p>
                <p>Q: I assume - I think I've heard it - a sizable number of Estonians during the
                    Stalin times were sent off to Siberia and never came back. Did this poison the
                    well a lot?</p>
                <p>TAYLOR: Well, it's a legacy that Estonians remember. There is a Remembrance Day
                    for, I guess it was, the 1948 evacuation of Estonians to Siberia, but you know,
                    there is a legacy here. This is one of the most difficult things to deal with
                    looking forward, to understand that there are legacies that need to be taken
                    into consideration in making judgments about how to move forward and at what
                    pace and in what ways. Some of the legacies are political; some are economic;
                    some are environmental; many are psychological. And you've got to think
                    carefully through them. Virtually every Estonian family - it's a small country -
                    virtually every Estonian family has some recent family member who was either
                    just taken out and summarily shot or who was taken out and then shipped to
                    Siberia. Sometimes whole families and whole villages disappeared, literally
                    overnight. Now that all plays a role, but I'll tell you, the Estonian character
                    and the Estonian culture is not one that seeks revenge. It doesn't forget this -
                    it remembers it; it has ceremonies about it and so forth - but I never
                    encountered in Estonia a hatred of Russians. I did encounter a hatred of Russia.
                    I never encountered fear of Russians. I did encounter fear of Russia. They do
                    not personalize these things to people who had nothing to do with them. And it
                    relates also to this so-called ethnic conflict in Estonia. There are no - and
                    I'm not talking about a few; I'm talking about no - there are no ethnic crimes
                    in Estonia. There are no instances of Estonians killing Russians because they're
                    Russians or vice versa or fighting with them or bullying them. This doesn't
                    occur. It's not in the system. So yes, there are these legacies. Part of it is
                    that it's a legacy of Communism. Yes, there are these legacies. Part of it is
                    Russia. But I have never found it to be personalized against others, you know,
                    individuals, in my experience, which is quite remarkable-</p>

                    who had taken my mom and dad out and shot them, I mean, I'm sorry, but we'd have
