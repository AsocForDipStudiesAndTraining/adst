            "<p>This collection is a rich source   of historical images of the Middle East. The majority of the images    depict Palestine (present day Israel and the West Bank) from 1898 to 1946. Most of the collection consists of over 22,000 glass  and film photographic negatives and transparencies created by the  American Colony Photo Department and its successor firm, the Matson  Photo Service. Over 1,000 photographic prints and eleven albums    are also part of this collection. </p> <p> Digital images for the negatives and transparencies and a   sample of the photographs are available online. </p> <h2>Background and Scope</h2> <h3>Introduction</h3> <p>The G. Eric and Edith Matson Photograph Collection (formerly known as the \"Matson Photo Service Collection\") contains over     23,000 glass and film negatives, transparencies, and     photographic prints, created by the American Colony Photo Department and its successor firm, the Matson Photo Service. The     collection came to the Library between 1966 and 1981, through a series of gifts made by Eric Matson and his beneficiary, the Home for the Aged of the Protestant Episcopal Church of the Diocese of Los Angeles (now called the Kensington Episcopal Home).</p> <div class=\"clear\"><!-- --></div> <figure class=\"image-align-right\"> <a href=\"/resource/matpc.05673/\"> <img src=\"http://lcweb2.loc.gov/service/pnp/matpc/05600/05673t.gif\" alt=\"Shepherd outside Jerusalem,&hellip;\" border=\"0\" height=\"150\" width=\"111\" /></a>  <figcaption>Shepherd outside Jerusalem, illustrating \"He leadeth me in the paths of righteousness,\" from the 23rd Psalm.<br />   <a href=\"/item/mpc2004005496/PP/\">LC-DIG-matpc-05673</a></figcaption> </figure> <h3>The American Colony Photo Department</h3> <p> The American Colony Photo Department in Jerusalem was one of several photo services operating in the Middle East before 1900. Catering primarily to the tourist trade, the American Colony and its competitors photographed holy sites, often including costumed actors recreating Biblical scenes.</p> <p>The American Colony outlasted the other services, successfully making the transition from 19th-century large-size albumen views to the smaller, less expensive picture postcard format which dominated the twentieth century. The firm's photographers were actual residents of Palestine. Their intimate knowledge of the land and people gave them an advantage over commercial photographers who were not based in Palestine and made their coverage more comprehensive. They documented Middle East culture, history, and political events from before World War I through the collapse of Ottoman rule, the British Mandate period, World War II, and the emergence of the State of Israel.</p> <div class=\"clear\"><!-- --></div> <figure class=\"image-align-left\"> <a href=\"/resource/matpc.02297/\"> <img src=\"http://lcweb2.loc.gov/service/pnp/matpc/02200/02297t.gif\" alt=\"Sir Herbert Samuel, first British High Commissioner visiting Jewish settlements...\" height=\"111\" width=\"150\" /></a>  <figcaption> Sir Herbert  Samuel, first British High Commissioner  visiting Jewish settlements,  Palestine, probably Richon le  Zion, July 27, 1920<br />   <a href=\"/item/mpc2004004671/PP/\">LC-DIG-matpc-02297</a></figcaption> </figure> <p> The Matson Collection also includes images of people and locations in present-day Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, Egypt, Iraq, and Turkey. Additionally, the firm produced photographs from an East African trip.

Some of these are stereographic negatives.</p> <p>The Matson negatives were a working file used by the staff of the American Colony Photo Department and the Matson Photo Service for almost 70 years. Evidence of the photographers' work can be seen in crop marks, tape, and other markings used in producing photographic prints. Some of the negatives have been damaged through use, transportation over long distances, or earlier storage conditions. Cracks, missing pieces, and loss of emulsion from water damage are visible in parts of the collection.</p> <h3 id=\"search\">Search Tips</h3> <p>In cataloging the collection, Prints &amp; Photographs Division staff used titles found on the original negatives and their storage sleeves, a photo register compiled by photo service staff, printed photo service catalogues, as well as other contemporary sources cited in the <a href=\"/collections/g-eric-and-edith-matson-photographs/about-this-collection/related-resources/#bibliography\">Bibliography section for the G. Eric and Edith Matson Photo Collection</a>. Subject headings have been added for the geographic places represented, but access by other topics relies primarily on information in the title.</p> <p>Because the titles vary in the amount of information they give and how it is expressed, it is best to try general searches, removing terms if you don't find desired images using multiple words or names. Those searching the records should be aware of more specific information regarding three approaches to the material:</p> <h3>Geographic names</h3> <p> Title and other information derived from the negatives or photographers' captions, reflects geographic place names for the time period 1898 to 1946. Staff has added the geographic headings for the current location of places to many of the records.</p> <h4>Examples of geographic headings added:</h4> <p><em>Lebanon\u2014Beirut<br />  Syria\u2014Aleppo<br />  Egypt\u2014Sinai.</em></p> <p>The geographic headings included in the records appear in an alphabetical list in the online <a href=\"/collections/g-eric-and-edith-matson-photographs/index/Subject/?q=\">Subject Index</a>, which is also available through the \"Browse: Subject and Format Headings\" link in the Matson Negatives search screens.</p> <h4>Photographs of Jerusalem</h4> <p>An \"All Text\" search for \"Jerusalem\" retrieves images that do not show  Jerusalem because the term \"Jerusalem\" appears in many records as part  of the name of the American Colony Photo Department. To search for  photographs showing Jerusalem, enter \"Jerusalem\" in the search box and  choose Jerusalem from the <a href=\"/collections/g-eric-and-edith-matson-photographs/index/subject/\">Subject facet list.</a></p> <h3>Non-geographic Subjects</h3> <p>Some records include topical subject headings and more will be indexed in the future. When searching for the names of objects, ethnic or religious groups, activities, or other subjects, it is best to use as many different keyword variants as possible. For example, if one is searching for pictures of pottery, doing separate searches for the keywords <em>pottery</em>, <em>potter</em>, <em>ceramics</em>, <em>faience</em>, and <em>jar</em> will retrieve more records with relevant images than a search for one of these terms.</p> <p><strong>Photographers' names</strong></p> <p>Although the names of many of the American Colony Photo Department and Matson Photo Service photographers are known (see the American Colony and Matson Photo Service section on the <a href=\"/collections/g-eric-and-edith-matson-photographs/about-this-collection/related-resources/#photographers\">American Colony photographers</a>), most of the catalog records do not contain the name of a photographer. Therefore, searches for individual names will not yield many images.</p> <p>Attribution of negatives to particular photographers is difficult as the communal principles of the American Colony encouraged group rather than individual credit. Some photographs are marked only \"American Colony, Jerusalem.\" Many published photographs give credit to \"the photographers of the American Colony in Jerusalem,\" \"the American Colony Photo Dept.,\" \"American Colony Photographers,\" or the \"Matson Photo Service.\" Attribution of the negatives to specific photographers remains a task for future researchers.</p> <p>Text prepared by: Verna Curtis, Curator of Photography, and Arden Alexander, Cataloger, March 2004.

            "28 albums (ca. 3,138 photographic prints) ; 31 x 41 cm. (12 x 16 in.)  or smaller (albums) | 23 photographic prints  ; 26 x 58 cm. (8 x 23 in.) or smaller | 29 negatives  : safety and nitrate ; 4 1/2 x 3 1/2 in. or smaller. | 19 transparencies  : color ; 2 1/2 x 2 1/2 in. | 1 book ; 48 cm. | John D. Whiting, a member of the American Colony in Jerusalem, worked as a tour guide, businessman, writer, and photographer.  Photograph albums show people, locations, and events in the Middle East generally from the 1890s to 1954. Two albums document Palestine (present day Israel, the West Bank and the Gaza Strip) and the Sinai during World War I, showing Ottoman/German and British military activities, as well as the early British Mandate period (LOTs 13827 and 13833). Other notable albums include images of British officials meeting with Arab leaders in Amman in 1921 (LOT 13834), a series of \"Diaries in Photos\" depicting scenes and events in Palestine, Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, and Turkey from 1934 to 1939 (LOTs 13836-13842), photographs of the Dead Sea and the Palestine Potash Company (LOT 13857), Bedouin life (13852), and an American Colony bazaar in 1954 (13850). One album of mostly hand-colored images depicts Jerusalem, Bethlehem, Jaffa, and other locations (LOT 13846). Other albums contain primarily family photographs of John D. Whiting, his wife Grace (Spafford) Whiting, and their children as well as other American Colony members, especially the family of Bertha (Spafford) Vester (LOTs 13835, 13843-13845, 13848, 13849).  Also depicted in the albums are friends and associates of the American Colony and others such as George Asfar, Esrohee Krikorian, Bedouin Sheik Majid, Faidi al-Alami, Consul-General Wadsworth, and Hussein al-Husseini.  In addition to the albums, the collection includes several panoramic photographs of Jerusalem and Haifa (LOT 13892), cabinet card photographs by the Krikorian Studio (LOT 13872), stereographs (LOT 13883),  and photographs of Jerusalem by Robertston & Beato (LOT 13882). Color transparencies and negatives show people and scenes in Palestine and Syria."
